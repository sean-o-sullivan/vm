"Carpenter Stephen H  Stephen Haskins ","""An inductive series is only a deductive series read backward. Any two terms in a series whether inductive or deductive, differ only in the degree of generality, and differ similarly from a third term, so that two being known the third can be therefrom determined. In a deductive series the terms differ by a constant increase in the number of individualizing attributes--a concept being expanded into a deductive series by such regular additions. Having two terms we can proceed to the third--that is, from two propositions expressing this relation, we can proceed to a conclusion. In an inductive series the terms differ by a constant diminution in the number of individualizing attributes--an individual term being expanded into an inductive series, by successively dropping the attributes which compose the individual term, until we reach the required degree of generalization. Thought must proceed in one of these two directions. The object-matter of thought being composed wholly of attributes can differ only in the presence or absence of certain attributes. A combination, then, of these two movements must complete the intellectual orbit. The direction of the movement of the mind will be determined by the end proposed. When we possess the knowledge of phenomena and wish to discover law--that is, when we seek information--we proceed by induction, from the individual to the general. When possessed of knowledge, we wish to discover its applications, when knowing the law, we wish to determine the phenomena necessarily resulting therefrom, we proceed by deduction--from the general to the individual. Complete knowledge, then, consists in the highest possible generalization, and the expansion of this term into a series, ending only with the last possible individualization. The aim of physical science is to determine that half of the intellectual orbit which lies between the individual and the general--the aim of metaphysical science is to trace the other half which lies between the general and the individual. When we seek to know what is, we proceed by induction--the method of the phenomenal. When, knowing what is, we proceed to determine what hence must be, we proceed by deduction--the method of the Necessary. Thus Science, at first seeking principles, proceeds by induction to establish them; but after these fundamental principles have been established, it proceeds deductively to determine what must result from them, without waiting to discover these truths by observation. Knowledge is thus complete just in proportion to the extension of its scope through generalization. The higher the generalization, the more inclusive will it be, and the summum genus, or the final generalization, will be the highest attainable reach of knowledge. When man can make no further generalization, his knowledge will be, in so far, absolute and complete, and all that remains possible to him will be the practical application of what he already knows. Perfect knowledge is nothing but perfect generalization. The Supreme Intelligence being hypothetically possessed of all knowledge, that is, having discriminated the absolute summum genus, can proceed no further in this direction; his intellectual activity must be exerted in a descending series, or from the general towards the individual, and this process must be, as we have seen above, by a determinate series of steps, fixed by the operation of a definite law, which law proceeds by the successive addition of attributes to the general. Complete knowledge, being complete generalization, the lines of all science will necessarily converge, as they approach this generalization, until all sciences coalesce in one science, and all truth is reduced to a single expression in the utterance of the final conception. In accordance with the laws of thinking, this general term is reached by successive omissions of particularizing attributes, until at last we reach Being--the absolute summum genus, wholly free from individual attributes, and thereby embracing everything possible to thought, whether material or immaterial. But this summum genus must be predicable of this whole. Matter and mind may thus be reduced to a single category, and the physical and the intellectual finally coalesce in this last generalization. Materialism and idealism thus differ merely in the degree of generalization reached--or rather they both agree in avoiding the final generalization which identifies both matter and mind. Materialism must always deal with the individual, for matter can appear under no other form. Idealism must always rest upon the general, for thought, to be thought, must state a generalization. Each, however, finds its explanation in the other, and both are harmonized by the application of the law of intellectual action above given. Matter and Mind are complementary, not incompatible. They differ with each other, but they agree in being similarly related to a third term. Matter is objective; it is thought taking form, becoming individual, manifesting itself in space. Mind is subjective. The one appeals to the senses; the other is known only to the consciousness. Science reaches its full development only when it includes both physical and intellectual phenomena within its scope. Every step which it takes carries it further from the purely physical, and brings it nearer the purely intellectual--that is the development of physical science is from the individual towards the general, and it reaches its end, its completion, only when the last distinction, that of subjective and objective, has disappeared in the last possible generalization. When the objective has been identified with the subjective, the distinction between Mind and Matter has been obliterated, and we have reached the Supreme Intelligence--the 'I Am' of Scripture--simple Being. Matter is the formal expression of thought, or the necessary condition of such expression, and in this condition is found the link that connects the subjective and objective manifestations of being. Subjectivity is ideality, as objectivity is materiality. The consciousness can take cognizance only of what is within itself, and therefore without every other. Consciousness is therefore wholly personal. To communicate an idea it must be placed within the consciousness of another. To reach this result it must cease to be personal, must pass out of the subjective consciousness into objective form, so as to be placed in the same relation to the speaker and the hearer. Thought, out of the consciousness of the thinker, is objective to him, and to render thought objective is to give it material form. Thought to be communicated, must pass out of the consciousness of the thinker into a material representation. The assumption of material form individualizes the idea. The artist's mind may be filled with splendid conceptions, but no one but he can look within his consciousness and see them. Before others can have any knowledge of his thoughts, he must give them form, or embody them in statues or paintings. The soul of the musician may be thrilled by the harmonies that his imagination creates, but no other soul can join him in this ecstasy until he has given form to his conceptions. So the thinker must embody his thoughts in language before he can communicate them to another. Matter, then, is the vehicle by which thought is communicated, and, so far as we are concerned, the necessary condition of such communication, so that the conception of thought apart from the thinker involves the intervention of material forms, and it is by the interpretation of these symbolical forms that we discover the idea. Now, let us suppose a Supreme Intelligence. The intellectual processes of such a Being, to be conceived as rational by us, must be identical with ours, or at least analogous to ours. The possession of infinite attributes may in fact free him from the control of any law, but it is impossible for us to conceive an intelligence acting otherwise than in accordance with law. So that if the Supreme Intelligence is to communicate with man, it must be in obedience to the laws which control our mental activities. The Divine thought must, then, like human conceptions, be communicated by means of physical symbols. The Supreme Intelligence, being the final generalization, must possess all knowledge, and the only intelligent action possible to him from our point of view, is from this absolute generalization towards the concrete and individual. The absolute general is purely subjective, which, to become cognizable, must be rendered objective. This can be secured to us only through the intervention of material forms. From this point of view, matter is only the symbol of thought--thought apart from the thinker. The first result of the divine activity in self-manifestation would be the analysis of being into subjective and objective--that is the discrimination of mind and matter, which terms are severally the final generalizations of the two fundamental divisions of science. Matter, then, mere formless, chaotic matter, would be the first result of creative activity. Following the development of this idea in its continually increasing individuality, as new attributes are severally added, matter assumes determinate form and becomes related in systems, as the various so-called elementary substances are discriminated, until finally all truth, capable of being revealed by inorganic matter, is presented to us. Add the idea of organism and we have the two great divisions of phenomena--material and vital. The higher the generalization, the fewer will be the attributes composing the concept, and thus the simpler will be the form symbolizing its expression.""","""Inductive and Deductive Reasoning Dynamics""","1848","""Inductive and deductive reasoning are two fundamental methods used in the field of logic and philosophy to draw conclusions and make sense of the world around us. Both approaches have their unique strengths and weaknesses, and understanding their dynamics is essential for critical thinking and problem-solving. Inductive reasoning involves moving from specific observations to broader generalizations, while deductive reasoning starts with general premises to reach specific conclusions. The interplay between these two forms of reasoning shapes how we interpret information, make decisions, and build knowledge. Let's delve deeper into the dynamics of inductive and deductive reasoning and explore how they influence our understanding of the world.  Inductive reasoning is like building a puzzle without seeing the final picture. It starts with specific observations or evidence and moves towards broader generalizations or theories. This method is particularly useful in scientific research, where observations lead to the formulation of hypotheses. Through repeated observations or experiments, researchers can infer general principles or rules that seem to hold true based on the evidence gathered. For example, after observing numerous instances of objects falling to the ground when released, one might induce the generalization that objects are pulled towards the Earth by gravity.  One of the key strengths of inductive reasoning is its potential for generating new ideas and hypotheses. By collecting and analyzing specific data, patterns or trends can emerge, leading to the development of new theories or explanations. This creative aspect of inductive reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and innovation, as it allows researchers to explore uncharted territories and come up with novel solutions to complex problems. However, the risk of inductive reasoning lies in the possibility of drawing erroneous conclusions due to incomplete or biased data, which can lead to false generalizations or faulty theories.  On the other hand, deductive reasoning is akin to solving a puzzle with all the pieces laid out. It starts with general principles, known as premises, and uses logical steps to arrive at specific conclusions. Deductive reasoning follows a top-down approach, where the validity of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. This method is commonly used in mathematics, formal logic, and everyday reasoning to establish logically sound arguments. For instance, if the premise is that all humans are mortal, and the second premise is that Socrates is a human, then deductive reasoning leads to the conclusion that Socrates is mortal.  The strength of deductive reasoning lies in its ability to provide certainty and validity in arguments where the premises are true. It offers a clear and structured path from general principles to specific statements, ensuring that the reasoning process is logically sound. Deductive reasoning is crucial in fields where precision and accuracy are paramount, such as mathematics and computer science, as it allows for the derivation of exact results based on established rules. However, the limitation of deductive reasoning is that if the premises are incorrect or the logic is flawed, the conclusions drawn will also be erroneous, highlighting the importance of starting with accurate premises.  While inductive and deductive reasoning are often presented as distinct approaches, they are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary methods that can work together in a dynamic process of reasoning. Inductive reasoning can be used to generate hypotheses and explore new ideas, while deductive reasoning can be employed to test those hypotheses and draw logical conclusions. This interplay between induction and deduction is central to the scientific method, where observations lead to hypotheses (induction), which are then tested through experiments to confirm or refute them (deduction).  Moreover, the dynamics of inductive and deductive reasoning are evident in everyday decision-making and problem-solving. When faced with a complex issue, individuals may use inductive reasoning to gather information, identify patterns, and formulate initial theories about the problem. They can then switch to deductive reasoning to test these theories, make predictions, and draw conclusions based on logical reasoning. This iterative process of moving between induction and deduction allows for thorough examination of the issue at hand and enhances the quality of decision-making.  In conclusion, understanding the dynamics of inductive and deductive reasoning is essential for developing critical thinking skills and fostering a deeper comprehension of the world. Inductive reasoning allows for the exploration of new ideas and theories based on specific observations, while deductive reasoning enables the validation of these ideas through logical reasoning and inference. By recognizing the strengths and limitations of both approaches, individuals can leverage the power of inductive and deductive reasoning to make informed decisions, solve complex problems, and advance knowledge in various fields. The synergy between these two forms of reasoning enriches our cognitive abilities and shapes our intellectual pursuits, contributing to a more profound understanding of the world we inhabit.""","912"
"Porter Robert P  Robert Percival ","""At this time the Guabairo proper contained 333 acres; later some 100 acres were hired or bought, and the colonia increased in area to about 433 acres, of which in 895/8, at the breaking out of the insurrection, 100 acres were planted with cane and the rest was pasture, woods, and waste lands. In 895/8, at the breaking out of the insurrection, the 100 acres under cane cultivation produced about,00,00 head. The cost for preparing, breaking up, cross-ploughing, marking, furrowing, seed cane, planting, cultivating, wear and tear to implements, and weeding one cane to maturity, and do it well, is from $400 to $600, according to conditions of soil, wages, etc., and under normal conditions will here require from three to four years before the farmer can see any profits, and then only by intelligent management and good soil. Soil which requires planting every three to five years will ruin any man. The average yield of cane per caballeria in Guabairo for 895/8 was about 1,00 arrobas, and the cost per 00 arrobas for weeding, cutting, carting, and delivering to the central amounted to about $.4.' The concluding passage of Mr. Beal's statement indicates to some extent the effect of the war upon his plantation, which escaped happily as compared with hundreds of others. He says: 'In 896 we had some new plantings, and the crop was estimated at,00,00 arrobas; very nearly the whole of this was burned by the insurgents, some of the fields were burned twice and no crop was made. The horses were seized, cattle driven off, storehouses plundered repeatedly, and finally the manager had to flee for his life and seek safety in Cienfuegos; since then the fields have suffered repeated burnings and the crop has been reduced from,00,00 arrobas to,00,00 arrobas, estimated. In 897 and 898 the crops were made under difficulties, the colonia employing a private armed force of sixteen men, and Colonel Luis Ramos Izquierdo kept a small garrison of his guerrillas in the colonia.' Contrasting opinions as to the matter of profit in the production of sugar in Cuba, we present herewith two statements. The first is by Mr. William J. Clark, in his work, Commercial Cuba, and is as follows: 'We have already seen that Mr. Gollan, the British Consul-General at Havana, estimates the factory cost of sugar in Cuba at the best managed centrals to be.0 cents per pound, although in exceptional cases it may be less. But during the month of October, 898, the selling price of raw centrifugal sugar, 6 degrees test, in the New York market has ranged between.0 and.0 cents per pound, neglecting United States import duty, which is a fixed rate of.85/8 cents per pound. If we take this selling price at.0 cents per pound, and deduct.2 cents per pound freight, wharfage, and commission, we get.8 cents as the price paid for raw sugar free on board at Cuban ports. From this amount must be taken export charges of five cents per 00 kilos lighterage at the port of shipment, and the cost of transportation from the central to the seaboard. These together sum up not less than.0 of one cent, which would leave the net price at the central.8 cents. But we have already shown that the factory cost of the product has been as low as.9 in Trinidad,.4 in British Guiana, and.6 in Barbadoes. These three costs give an average of.3 cents. Deducting from.8 cents which we have calculated as the present selling price at the central,.3 cents, the present possible minimum cost of production, we shall get.5/8 cents, equal to 2.5/8 per cent. as the margin of profit.' Mr. Clark takes New York prices in October, 898. These prices were not under normal conditions, the current prices of the year being - to - cents for 6 centrifugals in bond. Mr. Clark gives cost of Muscovado sugars at the British islands of Trinidad and Barbadoes. These sugars test 9, and are worth seven cents less per pound in New York than 6 test centrifugals. He compares cost and values as if they were worth the same money. Properly compared, his profit changes into loss. In this connection the following figures, especially prepared by an expert for this work, may be of interest: OF 00 CANE pounds Juice 8 ' -- Total 00 ' 8 pounds of juice containing 6 per cent. in sugar 4 ' PURE OF 00 CANE 'The practical results are difficult to obtain. The best of work seems to be about as follows: Per 00 pounds of cane: Bagasse 0 pounds ' -- Total 00 ' 0 pounds of juice at 6 per cent. sugar equal in pure sugar, 1.0' 'This 1.0 pounds of sugar, less loss of working and less the sugar left in the final molasses, reduced the actual yield to about 0 per cent. of pure sugar, or 0- per cent. of commercial product, besides the mechanical difficulty of increased impurities, whose ratio increases rapidly with better milling, and the loss of fuel in the bagasse, which is an important consideration where such loss must be made up by imported coal. 'With 0 pounds of bagasse per 00 pounds of cane, no other fuel should be required. 'The difficulty of increasing the sugar contents of the cane comes from the fact that cane, unlike beet, has no seed, and must be reproduced from cuttings. 'Improvement in this line is quite possible, but must come from long years of study and experiment and will require the best attention of scientific minds.' The expert who furnished the above, adds: 'It will seem strange to the uninitiated that the manufacturers can afford to leave any sugar in the bagasse, if there is any possible method of getting it out; but with low prices for the sugar product and expensive coal it can be seen that there is a point beyond which it may not be profitable to pass. With cheap fuel and high-priced sugar products, the case might be different.' The second statement, which is at considerably greater length, is by Mr. E. F. Atkins, who prepared the following especially for this volume: The total output of sugar in the world was for some years in excess of the requirements for consumption. This over-production and consequent accumulation of stocks brought prices down to a point which in all probability was considerably below the average cost of production. Germany, as the largest sugar-producing country, naturally fixes the market prices of the world. The refiner in New York will pay no more for sugars to be shipped from Havana than the equivalent of the price at which he can buy at Hamburg; difference of freight, duties, bounties, and quality, of course, considered. The present average cost of production of German raw sugar is said to be about s. per 12 pounds. At this figure the existing bounty upon exports would allow sales for shipment to England, where no duty is paid, as low as s.= $.1 per pound for 8 analysis beets; this, allowing for difference in values of the two grades, would be equivalent to $.9 United States currency for 6 test Cuba centrifugals, under like conditions, viz.: f.o.b. at port of shipment, for any country such as England where the two grades enter upon equal terms. The effect of our countervailing duty assessed upon bounty-fed sugars under the Dingley Act of 897, has been to raise the comparative value of cane sugar in producing countries, as against beet sugar, and to place Germany and other European sugar countries in exactly the same condition, so far as the United States market is concerned, as if no bounties were paid by them; thus in considering Germany's competition with Cuba in the United States markets, we may eliminate both bounties and countervailing duties as factors, and say that when Germany can sell to England at s. she must obtain s. from the United States to give her shippers an equal price; s. is equivalent to about $.8 United States currency, for Cuba centrifugals, 6 test, f.o.b. Cuba. The export price of German sugar at Hamburg from January to June, 898 (a period covering the Cuban sugar crop season), ranged from s. to s. d. with an average of about s. - d. Last crop prices gave the Cuban manufacturers an average of about - reals per arroba, say - cents Spanish gold, a price at which they could be laid down in New York slightly under the parity of European beets, duty paid. The imports of beet sugar from Europe into the United States, from January to June, 898, were 2,00 tons against 96,00 tons for same period of previous year; while imports of cane sugars showed an increase of some 0,00 tons; this change in source of supply being brought about by the countervailing duty. It is not possible to give any figures of the average cost of production in Cuba. In my opinion it is undoubtedly higher than the average of Germany.""","""Cuban sugar production and economics""","1961","""Cuban sugar production has played a significant role in the country's economy, shaping its history, politics, and international relations. For decades, sugar was the primary export of Cuba, making it one of the world's leading sugar producers. The sugar industry in Cuba was deeply intertwined with its economy and social structure, defining its identity and influencing its trajectory.  During the colonial period, Cuba became known as the """"Pearl of the Antilles"""" due to its lucrative sugar plantations. Large estates, known as """"ingenios,"""" sprung up across the island, fueled by African slave labor. By the late 19th century, Cuba was the largest sugar exporter globally, supplying a substantial portion of the United States' sugar consumption.  The rise of the sugar industry brought wealth to a select group of Cuban landowners while leaving the majority of the population impoverished. This wealth disparity contributed to social tensions and ultimately led to the Cuban War of Independence against Spanish colonial rule in 1895.  Following the end of Spanish rule and the brief U.S. occupation, Cuba's sugar industry continued to dominate its economy. American companies, such as the United Fruit Company and others, heavily invested in Cuban sugar production, exerting significant influence over the island's politics and economy. This influence culminated in the Cuban Revolution of 1959, led by Fidel Castro, which sought to overthrow the corrupt government and address social injustices, including inequalities in the sugar industry.  After the revolution, the Cuban government nationalized the sugar industry, seizing lands and assets owned by foreign companies. Castro aimed to redistribute land to peasants and create a more equitable economy. The government invested heavily in modernizing sugar mills and increasing production capacity. The Soviet Union became a key trading partner, buying Cuban sugar at preferential prices.  However, the reliance on sugar proved to be a double-edged sword for Cuba. The industry was vulnerable to fluctuating global prices and market demands. In the 1980s, a combination of inefficiencies, poor planning, and the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a severe economic crisis known as the """"Special Period."""" Cuba's economy contracted, and food shortages became widespread.  In recent years, Cuba has sought to diversify its economy to reduce its dependence on sugar. Tourism, biotechnology, and other sectors have been targeted for growth. Nevertheless, sugar remains an essential part of Cuba's identity and agricultural landscape. The country's sugar production, with its rich history and complex economic impact, continues to be a central feature of Cuba's past, present, and future.""","513"
"MacNeill J G Swift John Gordon Swift ","""Rapin, xvii., p. 17. The date of this letter is 6th of July, 698. The matter was so urgent that William III. wrote two letters. See 'English in Ireland,' i. 97. 'English in Ireland,' vol. i., p. 97. Ibid., p. 97. 0 & 1 Will. III., c. 0. 'English in Ireland,' vol. i., p. 39. The charge of indolence which Mr. Froude has here preferred against the Irish peasantry has frequently been refuted. The accusation is an old one. Speaking in the Irish House of Commons in 784, the Right Hon. Luke Gardiner thus repelled it:--'Those who render our people idle are the first to ridicule them for that idleness, and to ridicule them without a cause. National characteristics are always unjust, as there never was a country that has not produced both good and bad.' 'They are general assertions, as false as they are illiberal. Irishmen have shown spirit and genius in whatever they have undertaken.' 'I call upon gentlemen to specify one instance where the people were indolent when the laws of their country protected them in their endeavours.' ('Irish Debates,' iii., p. 27.) 'It is a cant in England,' says Mr. O'Connell, 'that an idle people, but how can that be said when they are to be found seeking employment through every part of the world? They are to be found making roads in Scotland and digging canals in the poisonous marshes of New Orleans.' ('Discussion in Dublin Corporation on Repeal of the Union,' in 843, p. 8) The Times of the 6th of June, 845/8, in an article to which I will refer hereafter, says 'The Irishman is disposed to work.' 'English in Ireland,' vol. i., 41-46. The subsequent history of this Bill as related by Mr. Froude is interesting. It became law in 727, but was practically ineffective. See Lecky's 'Eighteenth Century,' ii., 48. 'English in Ireland,' vol. ii., 13, 14. 'English in Ireland,' vol. ii., 14. 'Irish Debates,' vol. iii., 32. 'Parliamentary Register,' 7, 5/85/8. 'Commercial Restraints,' pp. 0-1. Speaking of the great distress in the years 740 and 741, Hely Hutchinson again deplores the inability of the Irish Parliament to alleviate the misery of the poor. ' not have been insensible of the miseries of their fellow-creatures, many thousands of whom were lost in those years, some from absolute want and many from disorders occasioned by bad provisions. Why was no attempt made for their relief? Because the Commons knew that the evil was out of their reach, and the poor were not employed because they were discouraged by restrictive laws from working up the materials of their own country, and that agriculture could not be encouraged when the lower classes of the people were not enabled by their industry to purchase the produce of the farmer's labour.'--('Commercial Restraints,' pp. 7-8.) 'Commercial Restraints,' pp. 10, 11. George II. (Irish) c. 3. This Irish Statute was framed on the model of an Act passed by the English Parliament in 678, providing that all dead bodies should be wrapped in woollen shrouds. Dean Swift warmly approved of this measure which, however, he seemed to think would never pass the Privy Councils. 'What,' he says, 'if we should agree to make burying in woollen a fashion, as our neighbours have made it a law?' Swift's had little power except that of protesting against laws crushing Irish commerce, but what little it could do it appears to have done.'--'Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland,' p. 87. 'Parliamentary Register,' 7, 49. Mr. Lecky refers doubtless to the Treaty of Limerick. 'Eighteenth Century,' vol. ii., 5/86. 'English in Ireland,' vol. ii., 13. IV. THE OF ON. The immediate effects produced upon Ireland by the commercial policy of Great Britain were such as might reasonably be anticipated from the brief and necessarily imperfect account I have given of that system. The best and most energetic members of the industrial community sought refuge in exile from a land where honest labour was robbed by law of its reward. The weaker ones, who were compelled to remain, this terrible system defrauded, impoverished, and degraded. It afflicted every Irishman, whether at home or abroad, with a sense of intolerable wrong, and created that passionate resentment towards England, which has been transmitted to succeeding generations. 'One of the most obvious consequences,' says Mr. Lecky, 'was that for the space of about a century Ireland underwent a steady process of depletion, most men of energy, ambition, talent, or character being driven from her shores.' 'If the ambition of an Irishman lay in the paths of manufacture and commerce he was almost compelled to emigrate, for industrial and commercial enterprise had been deliberately crushed.' This legislation, it must be remembered, fell most severely on the Protestant population of Ireland, although, of course, it grievously affected every class, and, indeed, every member of the community. Twenty thousand Puritans left Ulster on the destruction of the woollen trade. 'Until the spell of tyranny was broken, in 782, annual ship-loads of families poured themselves out from Belfast and Londonderry. The resentment they carried with them continued to burn in their new homes; and, in the War of Independence, England had no fiercer enemies than the great-grandsons of the Presbyterians who had held Ulster against Tyrconnel.' At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Mr. Lecky thinks the population of Ireland slightly exceeded two millions, and he adopts the calculation of a contemporary writer that the woollen manufacture at the time of its suppression afforded employment to 2,00 Protestant families in the metropolis, and 0,00 dispersed over the rest of the kingdom. We can, therefore, see at a glance how large a fraction of the entire population of the country were directly deprived of bread by that measure. Swift, whose deanery lay in the liberties of Dublin, the principal seat of the woollen manufacture, and who witnessed the results of its suppression, thus writes:--'Three parts in four of the inhabitants of that district of the town where I dwell were English manufacturers, whom either misfortunes in trade, little petty debts contracted through illness, or the presence of a numerous family, had driven into our cheap country. These were employed in working up our worse wool, while the finest was sent into England. Several of these had taken the children of the native Irish apprentices to them who, being humbled by the forfeiture of upwards of three millions by the Revolution, were obliged to stoop to a mechanic industry. Upon the passing of this bill, we were obliged to dismiss thousands of these people from our service. Those who had settled their affairs returned home, and overstocked England with workmen; those whose debts were unsatisfied, went to France, Spain, and the Netherlands, where they met with good encouragement, whereby the natives having got a firm footing in the trade, being acute fellows, so became as good workmen as any we have, and supply the foreign manufacturers with a constant supply of artisans.' 'Upon the checking the export of our woollen manufactures,' writes Mr. Arthur Dobbs, in 729, 'and by laying on heavy duties on its being exported to England in 699 and 700, equivalent to a prohibition, most of those who were embarked in it were laid under a necessity of removing elsewhere; and, being piqued at the difficulties they were laid under, many of the Protestants removed into Germany, and settled in the Protestant states there, who received them with open arms. Several Papists at the same time removed into the northern parts of Spain, where they laid the foundations of a manufacture highly prejudicial to England. Many also of the Protestants who were embarked with Papists in the woollen manufacture, removed into France, and settled at Roan and other parts. Notwithstanding Louis XIV. had repealed the Edict of Nantes, and forced abroad the French Protestants into different parts of Europe, yet these were kindly received by him, had great encouragement given to them, and were protected in their religion. From these beginnings they have in many branches so much improved the woollen manufactures of France, as not only to supply themselves, but even to vie with the English in the foreign markets; and by their correspondence they have laid the foundation for the running of wool thither both from England and Ireland, highly to the prejudice of Britain, which pernicious practice is still carried on in spite of all the care and precaution made use of to discountenance and prevent it. Thus a check is put upon the sale of our woollen manufactures abroad, which would have given employment to all the industrious poor both of Britain and Ireland, had not our manufacturers been forced away into France, Spain, and Germany, where they are now so improved as in great measure to supply themselves with many sorts they formerly had from England.' In 773 the Irish House of Commons 'had to hear from the Linen Board that 'many thousands of the best manufacturers and weavers, with their families, had gone to seek their bread in America, and thousands were preparing to follow.' Again a committee was appointed to inquire.""","""Irish Commercial Policy and Indolence Accusations""","2020","""Irish Commercial Policy has a turbulent history intertwined with accusations of indolence leveled against the Irish people. This complex relationship dates back centuries, marked by economic struggles, colonial exploitation, and shifting power dynamics.  Throughout history, Ireland's commercial policies have been heavily influenced by external forces, particularly British colonial rule. The Penal Laws imposed by the British government in the 17th and 18th centuries severely restricted Ireland's ability to engage in trade and industry, aiming to stifle economic independence and maintain control over the Irish population. These laws limited Irish exports, imposed high tariffs, and favored British merchants, leading to economic hardship and dependence on England.  The perception of the Irish as indolent or lazy stems from a misguided narrative that ignores the systemic injustices and economic constraints imposed on the Irish population. The stereotype of the """"lazy Irishman"""" was perpetuated by British propaganda to justify colonial exploitation and portray the Irish as inferior. In reality, Ireland's economic struggles were a direct result of oppressive policies that hindered economic development and perpetuated poverty.  In the 19th century, the Irish famine further exacerbated economic disparity and fueled accusations of indolence. The Great Famine of the 1840s, caused by a potato blight, resulted in mass starvation and emigration, leaving a devastating impact on Ireland's population. British mismanagement and negligence during the famine worsened the crisis, leading to widespread suffering and loss of life.  Despite these challenges, Ireland experienced a period of economic growth and industrialization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The emergence of industries such as textiles, brewing, and agriculture contributed to the country's economic development, challenging the narrative of Irish indolence. However, Ireland's economic progress was hindered by continued political unrest, land disputes, and religious divisions.  The establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922 marked a turning point in Ireland's commercial policies and economic trajectory. The drive for independence fueled efforts to promote domestic industry, trade, and self-sufficiency. The protectionist policies implemented by the Irish government aimed to foster economic independence and reduce reliance on foreign powers.  In modern times, Ireland has emerged as a global hub for technology, pharmaceuticals, and financial services, showcasing its economic resilience and innovation. The country's open economy, skilled workforce, and favorable business environment have attracted multinational corporations and foreign investment, driving economic growth and prosperity.  The accusations of indolence leveled against the Irish people throughout history reflect a narrow and biased perspective that fails to acknowledge the complex socio-political factors influencing Ireland's economic development. Ireland's journey from colonial subjugation to economic success is a testament to the resilience and determination of its people, challenging stereotypes and misconceptions.  In conclusion, Irish Commercial Policy has been shaped by a history of colonial oppression, economic struggles, and efforts to overcome adversity. The accusations of indolence directed at the Irish population are rooted in prejudice and ignorance, failing to recognize the resilience and ingenuity of the Irish people. Ireland's path to economic prosperity highlights the importance of historical context and systemic factors in shaping a nation's commercial policies and overcoming challenges.""","631"
"Llull Ramon 1232 1316","""Charles VI., the conqueror of Rosbec, was still young, and the schism of the Church had reached its point of the greatest violence. M. Paris's analysis of the work is very concise, and may be quoted in his own words:--'L'Arbre d'Honore Bonnet presente quatre branches principales, ^o. L'Eglise en schisme. ^o. Les Rois en guerre. ^o. Les Grandes en dissension. ^o. Les Peuples en revolte. Mais l'auteur paroit fort peu soucieux de suivre un ordre quelconque dans son travail. Apres avoir dans les premiers chapitres applique la prophetie des cinq Anges de l'Apocalypse a l'Histoire Ecclesiastique du XIV^e siecle, il resume les fastes de l'antiquite, puis enfin expose la theorie du comportement des Armes, des droits et des devoirs de tous les vassaux, chevaliers et gens de guerre.' The author HONORE, was a Monk in the Abbey of Ile-Barbe of Lyons, and Prior of Salon in Provence. His name, which is often given as Bonnor, or Bonhor, or Bonnoz, has been ascertained, from an examination of nearly twenty ancient Manuscripts in the Royal Library at Paris, to have been. A Provencal translation, made in the year 429 by order of Mossen Ramon de Culdes, is preserved in the same collection, No. 45/80; and also a translation in the Catalan dialect, MS. No. 807. There is some indication of Caxton having translated in part the work in the year 490, but no copy is known to exist. The original work was first printed at Lyons, by Barthelemy Buyer, 477, folio; and another edition at Lyons in 481. It was again printed at Paris, by Anthoine Verard, 493, folio, of which there is, in the Royal Library at Paris, a magnificent copy printed upon Vellum, with illustrations,--the first representing Charles VIII. receiving the work from Verard the printer, who, as already noticed, had substituted the name of the reigning Monarch instead of Charles VI. of France, at whose request the work was originally written. Van Praet describes this copy, and mentions two other copies on Vellum, but neither of them perfect. The discrepancies existing between the early manuscript and printed copies will readily explain the variations, which will be obvious upon comparing Sir Gilbert Hay's translation with the preceding extracts. It must also be confessed, that to a modern reader Bonnet's Book of Battles is sufficiently tedious and uninteresting; and it need excite no surprize that the Author, as he admits in his concluding chapter, having wearied himself with his task, broke off abruptly--'Mais pour le present je ne pense plus riens a escripre en ce Livre, car j'en suis tout lasse;' or, as Sir Gilbert Hay in his translation expresses it--'But in gude faith the Doctour sais, that he was sa irkit of wryting, that he mycht nocht as now, na mare tak on hand as to put in this buke of Bataillis,' &c. II. THE BUKE OF THE OF. Although subjoined to 'The Buke of Batailles,' there is no evidence to show that it was written by the same Author. The original Work, entitled 'LE DE L' DE,' is anonymous. A copy of it is contained in a magnificent volume, written upon vellum, and illuminated for Henry VII. of England, which forms part of the Royal collection of Manuscripts in the British Museum (MSS. Bibl. Reg. 4 E. II. Art. ). The Work also exists in a printed form, although now of great rarity. 'L'Ordre de Chevalerie, auquel est contenue la maniere comment en doit, faire les Chevaliers, et de l'honneur qui a eux appartient, et de la dignite d'iceulx; compose par ung Chevalier, lequel en sa veillesse fut Hermite.' Lyon, Vincent de Portunaris de Trine, 5/810, in folio, black letter. It is, however, a proof of the great popularity of the Work, that a copy of it having fallen into the hands of our venerable Typographer,, (who probably never heard of Sir Gilbert Hay's previous version,) he added this to his other translations from the French, and having printed his own translation, he addressed the volume to King Richard the Third. It has no date, but must have been printed about the year 484; and his edition is acknowledged to be one of the rarest specimens of his press. Lewis in his Life of Caxton, 737; Oldys in his British Librarian, 738; Ames and Herbert in their Typographical Antiquities, 749 and 785/8; and Dibdin, in his enlarged edition of that work, 810, and also in his Bibliotheca Spenceriana, 815/8, have each given a more or less detailed account of Caxton's translation. In the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, among the collection of MSS. which belonged to Sir James Balfour of Denmyln, Lord Lyon in the reign of Charles the First, there is a volume, to which he has prefixed this title, 'Collectanea Domini Davidis Lyndesay de Monthe Militis Leonis Armorum Regis.' This volume is described by Dr Leyden in the Preface to his republication of 'The Complaynt of Scotland,' but he has confounded two persons of the same name, and who held the same office, at an interval of half a century. The volume, which contains nothing to identify it with Sir David Lyndesay the Poet, is here noticed, from containing a copy of 'The Order of Knighthood,' without the name of the translator. This is evidently a transcript from Caxton's printed volume, omitting the concluding Address to Richard the Third, in which Caxton introduces his own name as the translator; while the transcriber has used his own discretion in adapting the language to the Scotish orthography and dialect. Dr Leyden passes over this portion of the MS. in a very summary manner, and strangely says, that it, along with 'The Buke of Cote-Armouris,' which immediately follows, in Lyndesay's MS., was transcribed from Dame Juliana Berners's Treatise on Hunting, Hawking, &c., which is usually known as the 'Booke of St Albans.' The following extracts from the copy of Caxton's volume, in the British Museum, will be sufficient to convey to the reader some idea of the work itself; and to form a comparison of the English and Scotish versions. The first leaf is here given in black letter, line for line, in imitation of the original:-- HERE THE OF THIS THE BOOK OF THE OF OR.

This event marked a definitive split between the Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) branches of Christianity, leading to enduring theological differences and shaping the course of Western civilization. Understanding the causes, consequences, and legacy of this schism is essential to comprehending the complexities of Christian history.  The roots of the Church Schism can be traced back to theological disputes, cultural differences, and political tensions that simmered for centuries between the Latin West and the Greek East. The primary theological issues that fueled the schism revolved around the interpretation of the Nicene Creed, the role of the pope, the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist, and the nature of the Holy Spirit's procession. These disagreements were compounded by linguistic and cultural disparities, as Latin and Greek-speaking Christians struggled to communicate and understand each other effectively.  The political climate of the time also played a significant role in the schism. The rise of powerful secular rulers in both the West and East increasingly intertwined with ecclesiastical affairs, leading to clashes over authority and jurisdiction. The crowning of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor in 800 CE by Pope Leo III strained relations with the Byzantine Empire, as it challenged the Eastern Emperor's status as the rightful ruler of the Christian world.  In 1054, these long-standing tensions came to a head when Patriarch Michael Cerularius of Constantinople and Cardinal Humbert of the Roman Church excommunicated each other, symbolizing the formal rupture between East and West. The mutual excommunications, though later revoked by both sides, marked the beginning of a permanent division that would persist for centuries to come.  The consequences of the Church Schism were profound and far-reaching. The split led to the establishment of two distinct branches of Christianity, each with its own theological doctrines, liturgical practices, and ecclesiastical structures. The Western Church, under the authority of the pope in Rome, developed into the Roman Catholic Church, while the Eastern Church, centered in Constantinople, evolved into the Eastern Orthodox Church.  The schism also had profound effects on the political landscape of Europe and the Mediterranean world. As the two Christian spheres drifted apart, the Eastern and Western powers found themselves at odds, leading to conflicts such as the Crusades and the sack of Constantinople in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade. The schism contributed to the rise of nation-states and the secularization of politics, as monarchs and rulers sought to assert their authority independent of papal or imperial influence.  Despite the enduring division between Catholicism and Orthodoxy, efforts towards reconciliation have been made in recent decades, culminating in dialogues and joint declarations aimed at healing the centuries-old rift. The Second Vatican Council in the 1960s signaled a willingness on the part of the Roman Catholic Church to engage in ecumenical dialogue with other Christian denominations, including the Eastern Orthodox Church, in pursuit of greater unity and understanding.  In conclusion, the Church Schism of 1054 stands as a pivotal moment in Christian history, marking the formal division between the Western and Eastern branches of Christianity. Fueled by theological disputes, cultural differences, and political tensions, the schism reshaped the Christian world and influenced the course of Western civilization. While the consequences of the schism are still felt today, ongoing efforts towards reconciliation offer hope for a future where Christian unity may be restored.  Knighthood Literature: Chivalry, Honor, and Adventure in Medieval Tales  The medieval period is often romanticized as an era of chivalry, heroism, and noble deeds, with knights embodying the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honor. In the literature of knighthood, these ideals are celebrated and explored through epic tales of quests, battles, and courtly love. From epic poems to romances, medieval literature offers a glimpse into the world of knights and the codes of conduct that governed their lives.  One of the most famous works of knighthood literature is the epic poem """"The Song of Roland."""" Dating back to the 11th century, this French chanson de geste recounts the heroic deeds of Roland, a loyal knight of Emperor Charlemagne, and his companions in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. The poem extols the virtues of bravery, sacrifice, and steadfastness in the face of overwhelming odds, showcasing the ideal of chivalry in action.  Another iconic figure in medieval literature is King Arthur, the legendary British monarch who ruled over Camelot and presided over the Knights of the Round Table. The Arthurian legends, popularized by writers like Sir Thomas Malory in """"Le Morte d'Arthur,"""" are replete with tales of chivalry, adventure, and courtly love. The knights of Arthur's court, including Lancelot, Gawain, and Percival, exemplify the virtues of knighthood through their quests for the Holy Grail, battles against enemies, and acts of valor.  Courtly love, a central theme in many medieval romances, explores the ideals of love, devotion, and nobility in the context of feudal society. Works like """"Tristan and Iseult"""" and """"Lancelot du Lac"""" depict the struggles and sacrifices of knights and ladies as they navigate the complexities of romantic relationships amid the constraints of social convention. Courtly love literature often juxtaposes the sublime and the earthly, portraying love as both a spiritual and physical experience.  The codes of chivalry, such as the chivalric virtues of courage, loyalty, and courtesy, are central to the portrayal of knights in medieval literature. Knights were expected to uphold these values in their interactions with others, whether in battle, at court, or in matters of the heart. The chivalric code emphasized the importance of honor, integrity, and service to one's lord, ideals that were both aspirational and normative for knights of the time.  In addition to epic poems and romances, medieval literature also includes practical guides for knights, such as """"The Book of the Courtier"""" by Baldassare Castiglione and """"The Art of War"""" by Sun Tzu. These works offer insights into the social customs, military tactics, and ethical principles that governed the lives of knights in medieval Europe, providing a comprehensive view of the knightly ideal as both a warrior and a gentleman.  In conclusion, knighthood literature offers a rich tapestry of stories, poems, and treatises that illuminate the world of medieval knights and the ideals of chivalry that guided their lives. From epic battles to courtly love affairs, medieval literature portrays knights as paragons of virtue, honor, and courage, embodying the noblest qualities of the human spirit. Through these timeless works, the legacy of knighthood continues to inspire and captivate readers, inviting them to journey into a world of adventure, romance, and heroism.""","1438"
"Petty William Sir","""5/8. 0. It seems somewhat hard, that all Taxes should be paid in money, viz., (when the King hath occasion to Victual his Ships at Portsmouth) that Fat Oxen, and Corn should not be received in kind, but that Farmers must first carry their Corn perhaps ten Miles to sell, and turn into money; which being paid to the King, is again reconverted into Corn, fetcht many miles further. 6. Moreover, the Farmer for haste is forced to under-sell his Corn, and the King for haste likewise, is forced to over-buy his provisions. Whereas the paying in kinde, Pro Hic & Nunc, would lessen a considerable grievance to the poor people. 7. The next confederation shall be of the consequences, and effects of too great a Tax, not in respect of particular men, of which we have spoken before, but to the whole people in general: To which I say, that there is a certain measure, and proportion of money requisite to drive the trade of a Nation, more or less then which would prejudice the same. Just as there is a certain proportion of Farthings necessary in a small retail Trade, to change silver money, and to even such reckonings as cannot be adjusted with the smallest silver pieces. For money, (made of Gold and silver) is to the (that is to the matter of our Food and Covering) but as Farthings, and other local extrinsick money, is to the Gold and Silver species. 8. Now as the proportion of the number of Farthings requisite in comerse is to be taken from the number of people, the frequency of their exchanges; as also, and principally from the value of the smallest silver pieces of money; so in like maner, the proportion of money requisite to our Trade, is to be likewise taken from the frequency of commutations, and from the bigness of the payments, that are by Law or Custome usually made otherwise. From whence it follows, that where there are Registers of Lands, whereby the just value of each mans interest in them, may be well known; and where there are Depositories of the, as of Metals, Cloth, Linnen, Leather, and other Usefuls; and where there are Banks of money also, there less money is necessary to drive the Trade. For if all the greatest payments be made in Lands, and the other perhaps down to ten pound, or twenty pound be made by credit in Lombars or Money-Banks: It follows, that there needs onely money to pay sums less then those aforementioned; just as fewer Farthings are requisite for change, where there be plenty of silver two Pences, then where the least silver piece is six Pence. 9. To apply all this, I say, that if there be too much money in a Nation, it were good for the Commonalty, as well as the King, and no harm even to particular men, if the King had in his Coffers, all that is superfluous, no more then if men were permitted to pay their Taxes in any thing they could best spare. 0. On the other side, if the largeness of a publick Exhibition should leave less money then is necessary to drive the Nations Trade, then the mischief thereof would be the doing of less work, which is the same as lessening the people, or their Art and Industry; for a hundred pound passing a hundred hands for Wages, causes a 0000l. worth of Commodities to be produced, which hands would have been idle and useless, had there not been this continual motive to their employment. 1. Taxes if they be presently expended upon our own Domestick Commodities, seem to me, to do little harm to the whole Body of the people, onely they work a change in the Riches and Fortunes of particular men; and particularly by transferring the same from the Landed and Lazy, to the Crafty and Industrious. As for example, if a Gentleman have let his Lands to Farm for a hundred pound per annum, for several years or lives, and he be taxed twenty pound per annum, to maintain a Navy; then the effect hereof will be, that this Gentlemans twenty pound per annum, will be distributed amongst Seamen, Ship-Carpenters, and other Trades relating to Naval matters; but if the Gentleman had his Land in his own hands, then being taxed a Fifth part, he would raise his Rents near the same proportion upon his under Tenants, or would sell his Cattle, Corn, and Wooll a Fifth part dearer; the like also would all other subdependents on him do; and thereby recover in some measure, what he paid. Lastly, but if all the money levied were thrown into the Sea, then the ultimate effect would onely be, that every man must work a fifth part the harder, or retrench a fifth part of his consumptions, viz. the former, if forreign Trade be improveable, and the latter, if it be not. 2. This, I conceive, were the worst of Taxes in a well policyed State; but in other States, where is not a certain prevention of Beggary and Theevery, that is a sure livelihood for men wanting imployment; there, I confess, an excessive Taxe, causes excessive and insuperable want, even of natural necessities, and that on a sudden, so as ignorant particular persons, cannot finde out what way to subsist by; and this, by the law of Nature, must cause sudden effects to relieve it self, that is, Rapines, Frauds; and this again must bring Death, Mutilations, and Imprisonments, according to the present Laws which are Mischiefs, and Punishments, as well unto the State, as to the particular sufferers of them. CHAP. IV. Of the several wayes of Taxe, and first, of setting a part, a proportion of the whole Territory for Publick uses, in the nature of Crown Lands; and secondly, by way of Assessement, or Land-taxe. But supposing, that the several causes of Publick Charge are lessened as much as may be, and that the people be well satisfied, and contented to pay their just shares of what is needfull for their Government and Protection, as also for the Honour of their Prince and Countrey: It follows now to propose the several wayes, and expedients, how the same may be most easily, speedily, and insensibly collected. The which I shall do, by exposing the conveniencies and inconveniences of some of the principal wayes of Levyings, used of later years within the several States of Europe: unto which others of smaller and more rare use may be referred.. Imagine then, a number of people, planted in a Territory, who had upon Computation concluded, that two Millions of pounds per annum, is necessary to the publick charges. Or rather, who going more wisely to work, had computed a twenty fifth part of the proceed of all their Lands and Labours, were to be the Excisum, or the part to be cut out, and laid aside for publick uses. Which proportions perhaps are fit enough to the affairs of England, but of that hereafter.. Now the question is, how the one or the other shall be raised. The first way we propose, is, to Excize the very Land it self in kinde; that is, to cut out of the whole twenty five Millions, which are said to be in England and Wales, as much Land in specie, as whereof the Rack-rent would be two Millions, viz. about four Millions of Acres, which is about a sixth part of the whole; making the said four Millions to be Crown Lands, and as the four Counties intended to be reserved in Ireland upon the forfeitures were. Or else to excize a sixth part of the rent of the whole, which is about the proportion, that the Adventurers and Souldiers in Ireland retribute to the King, as Quit Rents. Of which two wayes, the latter is manifestly the better, the King having more security, and more obligees, provided the trouble and charge of this universal Collection, exceed not that of the other advantage considerably.. This way in a new State would be good, being agreed upon, as it was in Ireland, before men had even the possession of any Land at all; wherefore whosoever buyes Land in Ireland hereafter, is no more concerned with the Quit Rents wherewith they are charged, then if the Acres were so much the fewer; or then men are, who buy Land, out of which they know Tythes are to be paid. And truly that Countrey is happy, in which by Original Accord, such a Rent is reserved, as whereby the Publick charge may be born, without contingent, sudden, superadditions, in which lies the very Ratio of the burthen of all Contributions and Exactions. For in such cases, as was said before, it is not onely the Landlord payes, but every man who eats but an Egg, or an Onion of the growth of his Lands; or who useth the help of any Artisan, which feedeth on the same.. But if the same were propounded in England, viz. if an aliquot part of every Landlords Rent were excinded or retrenched, then those whose Rents were settled, and determined for long times to come, would chiefly bear the burthen of such an Imposition, and others have a benefit thereby. For suppose A. and B. have each of them a parcel of Land, of equal goodness and value; suppose also that A. hath let his parcel for twenty one years at twenty pound per annum, but that B. is free; now there comes out a Taxe of a fifth part; hereupon B. will not let under 5/8l. that his remainder may be twenty, whereas A. must be contented with sixteen neat; nevertheless the Tenants of A. will sell the proceed of their bargain at the same rate, that the Tenants of B. shall do. The effect of all this is; First, that the Kings fifth part of B. his Farm, shall be greater then before. Secondly, that the Farmer to B. shall gain more then before the Taxe. Thirdly, that the Tenant or Farmer of A. shall gain as much as the King and Tenant to B. both. Fourthly, the Tax doth ultimately light upon the Landlord A. and the Consumptioners. From whence it follows, that a Land-taxe resolves into an irregular Excize upon consumptions, that those bear it most, who least complain. And lastly, that some Landlords may gain, and onely such whose Rents are predetermined shall loose; and that doubly, viz. one way by the raising of their revenues, and the other by enhansing the prices of provisions upon them.""","""Taxation and economic impact analysis""","2285","""Taxation plays a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of a country. It is a tool used by governments to raise revenue to fund public services, redistribute wealth, and influence economic behavior. When analyzing the economic impact of taxation, various factors come into play, including the type of taxes, the tax rates, and how the revenue is spent. Understanding how taxation affects the economy is essential for policymakers, businesses, and individuals alike.  One of the key considerations in economic impact analysis is the incidence of taxation. The incidence of a tax refers to who bears the economic burden of the tax. In many cases, the burden of a tax is passed on to consumers or workers in the form of higher prices or lower wages. For example, when a government imposes a tax on a specific good or service, the producer may increase prices to offset the tax, ultimately shifting the burden to consumers. Similarly, when corporate taxes are levied, the burden may fall on employees in the form of lower wages or on shareholders through reduced dividends.  Taxes can also affect consumer behavior and businesses' investment decisions. High taxes on certain goods, such as cigarettes or alcohol, can reduce consumption and improve public health outcomes. On the other hand, high taxes on businesses may discourage investment and hinder economic growth. Understanding the impact of taxes on consumer choices and investment can help policymakers design tax policies that achieve specific economic goals.  Furthermore, taxation can influence the distribution of income and wealth within a society. Progressive taxation, where tax rates increase with income, can help reduce income inequality by redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor. On the other hand, regressive taxes, such as sales taxes, tend to place a higher burden on low-income individuals. Analyzing the distributional impact of taxation is essential for ensuring that tax policies promote equity and social welfare.  Taxation also plays a critical role in funding public services and infrastructure. Taxes are the primary source of government revenue, which is used to finance essential services such as education, healthcare, transportation, and national defense. By analyzing the economic impact of taxation, policymakers can assess the trade-offs between the cost of taxation and the benefits of public spending. Efficient allocation of tax revenue is essential for promoting economic development and social well-being.  In addition to raising revenue, taxation can also be used as a tool to achieve broader economic objectives, such as promoting economic growth, reducing externalities, and addressing market failures. For example, environmental taxes can help internalize the external costs of pollution and encourage firms to adopt cleaner technologies. Similarly, tax incentives for research and development can stimulate innovation and economic growth. By incorporating economic impact analysis into tax policy design, governments can create more effective and efficient tax systems.  It is essential to consider the overall tax burden on individuals and businesses when assessing the economic impact of taxation. High tax rates can reduce incentives to work, save, and invest, ultimately slowing economic growth. Conversely, low tax rates can stimulate economic activity and lead to higher levels of investment and consumption. Finding the right balance between raising revenue and fostering economic growth is a key challenge for policymakers.  Another critical aspect of economic impact analysis is the concept of tax efficiency. A tax is considered efficient when it minimizes economic distortions and administrative costs. Inefficient taxes can hinder economic efficiency by distorting incentives and behavior. By evaluating the economic efficiency of different types of taxes, policymakers can identify ways to improve the overall tax system.  Moreover, tax policies can have spillover effects on international trade and investment. Countries with high corporate tax rates may struggle to attract foreign investment, as multinational corporations seek out jurisdictions with more favorable tax environments. Tax competition between countries can lead to a race to the bottom, where governments lower tax rates to attract investment, potentially reducing overall tax revenue. Understanding the international implications of tax policies is essential for maintaining a level playing field in the global economy.  In conclusion, taxation has far-reaching economic implications that go beyond revenue generation. By conducting thorough economic impact analysis, policymakers can assess the effects of tax policies on consumer behavior, investment decisions, income distribution, public services, economic growth, and international trade. A nuanced understanding of the economic impact of taxation is crucial for designing effective and equitable tax systems that support sustainable economic development.税""","847"
"Spence Lewis","""Inside these were kept the idols of the gods to whom the teocalli was sacred. Before these towers stood the stone of sacrifice, and two altars upon which the fires blazed night and day. In the city of Mexico six hundred of these fires rendered any artificial illumination at night superfluous. Through the very construction of these temples all religious services were of a public nature. In front of the great teocalli of Mexico stretched a court twelve hundred feet square, around which clustered the chapels of minor deities, and those captured from conquered peoples, as well as the dwellings and offices set apart for the attendant priests. Although it appears that the Toltecs, the forerunners of the Aztecs in Mexico, had at one period of their history been prone to human sacrifice, they had almost entirely discarded the practice at the time of their downfall. Some two hundred years before the coming of the Spaniards the Aztecs had adopted this abomination, and were in the habit of sparing the lives of immense numbers of prisoners of war solely for the purpose of offering them up to the national gods. As their empire extended, these holocausts became greater and more common. On the teocalli of Mexico the Spaniards could count one hundred and thirty-six thousand human skulls piled in a horrid pyramid. Of the sacrifices the most important was that signifying the annual demise of Tezcatlipoca. The most handsome of the captives who chanced to be in the hands of the Aztecs was chosen for the purpose. It was necessary that he should be without spot or blemish, as it was intended that he should represent Tezcatlipoca himself. He was taken in hand by a body of tutors, who instructed him how to play his allotted part with the dignity and grace to be expected from a divine being. Arrayed in magnificent robes typical of his godhead, and surrounded by an atmosphere of flowers and incense, he led the life of a voluptuary for the space of nearly a year. On the occasion of his appearance in the public streets he was received by the populace with all the homage due to a god, but was strictly guarded, nevertheless, by eight pages, who in reality were merely gaolers. Within a month's time of his immolation four beautiful girls were given him as wives, and he was feasted and feted by the nobility as the incarnation of Tezcatlipoca. On the day preceding the sacrifice the victim was placed on one of the royal canoes, and accompanied by his four wives, was rowed to the other side of the lake. That evening his wives bade him farewell, and he was stripped of his gorgeous apparel. He was then conducted to a teocalli some three miles from the city of Mexico. In scaling this he threw away the wreaths of flowers with which he had been adorned, and broke in pieces the musical instruments with which he had amused his hours of captivity. Crowds thronged from the city to behold the act of sacrifice. On reaching the summit of the teocalli the victim was met by six priests, five of whom led him to the sacrificial stone, a great block of jasper with a convex surface. On this he was placed by the five priests, who secured his head, arms, and legs, whilst the officiating priest, robed in a blood-red mantle, dexterously opened his breast with a sharp flint knife. He then inserted his hand into the gaping wound, and tearing out the still palpitating heart, held it aloft towards the sun. Then he cast the bleeding offering into a vessel containing burning copal, which lay at the feet of the image of Tezcatlipoca. A species of sermon was then delivered by one of the priests to the people in which he drew a moral from the fate of the victim illustrative of the inevitable conclusion of all human pleasure by the hand of death. Huitzilopochtli had also a representative sacrificed every year who had to take part in a sort of war-dance immediately before his immolation, and a woman was annually sacrificed to Centeotl, the maize-goddess. Before her death she took part in several symbolic representations which were expressions of the various processes in the growth of the harvest. The day before her sacrifice she sowed maize in the streets, and on the arrival of midnight she was decapitated and flayed. A priest arrayed himself in the still warm skin and engaged in mimic combat with soldiers who were scattered through the streets. Part of the skin was then carried to the temple of Centeotl the Son, where a priest made a mask of it in the likeness of the presiding deity, and afterwards sacrificed four captives in honour of the occasion. The skin was then carried to the frontiers of the empire, and buried. It was supposed that its presence there acted as a talisman against invasion. We have before described the sacrifices of children to Tlaloc. Even more gruesome were the awful doings at the festival of Xiuhtecutli, when the unhappy victims were half-roasted and finally despatched by having their hearts torn out. Cannibal feasts often followed these sacrifices--feasts which were the more horrible in that they were accompanied by all the accessories of a high standard of civilisation; but it must be remembered that their purport was essentially symbolic, and in no way partook of the nature of the orgies of flesh-famished savages. When the great temple of Huitzilopochtli was dedicated in 486, the chain of victims sacrificed on that occasion extended for the length of two miles. In this terrible massacre the hearts of no less than seventy thousand human beings were offered up! In the light of such appalling wickedness it is difficult to blame the Spanish conquerors of Anahuac in their zeal to blot out the worship of the deities whom they designated 'horrible demons.' These victims were nearly always captive warriors of rival nations, and it was on rare occasions only that native Mexicans were led to the stone of sacrifice unless, indeed, they were malefactors. The great jubilee festival, which was celebrated every fifty-two years throughout the empire, marked the coincidence of four times thirteen solar and four times thirteen lunar years. This the Mexicans called a 'sheaf of years,' and when the first day of the fifty-third year dawned, the ceremony of Toxilmolpilia, or 'the binding-up of years,' was held. Priests and people gazed feverishly at the Pleiades to see if they would pass the zenith. Should they do so the world would hold on its course for another similar period; if not, extinction would instantly follow. Fire was kindled upon a victim's breast by the friction of wood, and whenever it was alight the prisoner's heart was plucked out, and along with his body was consumed upon a pile of wood kindled by the new fire. As the flames ascended, and it was seen that the Pleiades had crossed the zenith, cries of joy burst from the assembled people below. Faggots were lighted at the sacred pyre, and domestic fires rekindled from them. Humanity had been respited for a generation. It is difficult to believe that a people so imbrued in a religion of bloodshed could have been punctilious in matters of morality, and it is still more difficult to believe the evidence of Sahagun and Clavigero concerning their personal piety. It seems certain, however, that as a race the Aztecs were austerely moral, pious, truth-loving, and loyal as citizens, and even the sanguinary priests do not appear to have reaped any benefit from their terrible offices. All the evidence would seem to show that it was the belief in the existence of cruel and insatiable gods which rendered the priests and people alike callous and insensible to the taking of human life, and this is the more easily understood when it is remembered that the Aztecs had at a comparatively late period emerged from a state of migratory savagery into the heirship of an ancient and complex civilisation. IV THE OF THE The civilisation of the Ancient Peruvians, although in many ways analogous to that of the Aztecs, was strangely dissimilar in some of its aspects. The peoples of the two empires were totally unaware of each other's existence, and were divided by dense tracts of mountain, plain, and forest, where the most intense savagery prevailed. It seems probable that the Peruvian culture had its origin in the region of Lake Titicaca, and that it was of an indigenous character admits of little doubt. Like the Mexicans, the Peruvians had displaced an older civilisation and an older race. What was the nature of that civilisation, and thanks to what people it flourished, it is at present impossible to say. Scattered over the surface of the Peruvian slope are Cyclopean ruins, the sole remnants of the works of a more primeval people. These ruins are chiefly to be found in the neighbourhood of Lake Titicaca and Cuzco, the ancient metropolis of the Incas. Whatever may have been the architectural ability of this ancient people, the usurpers had little to learn from them in this respect, or, more strictly speaking, having borrowed their methods, continued faithful to them. The temples and mansions of the Peruvians were massive and handsome, but for the most part covered only with a thatch of Indian maize straw. They made long, straight, macadamised roads which they pushed with surprising engineering skill through tunnelled mountains, spanning seemingly impassable gorges with marvellously constructed bridges. The temples and the palaces of the Incas were adorned with gold and silver ornaments of fabulous value and skilful design. Sumptuous baths, supplied with hot and cold water by means of pipes laid in the earth, were to be found in the houses of the aristocracy, and a high state of comfort and luxury prevailed. To describe the social polity of the Peruvians is to describe their religion, for the two were one and the same. The empire of Peru was the most absolute theocracy the world has ever seen, much more absolute, for example, than that of Israel under the Judges.""","""Aztec religious practices and sacrifices""","2130","""The religious practices of the Aztecs were intricate, deeply intertwined with their beliefs in the supernatural and the divine. At the core of Aztec spirituality was the concept of a complex pantheon of gods and goddesses who oversaw different aspects of life, from agriculture to war. Rituals and sacrifices played a central role in their religious ceremonies, viewed as essential for maintaining cosmic balance and appeasing the deities. Understanding Aztec religious practices and sacrifices provides insight into the worldview and values of this ancient Mesoamerican civilization.  Central to Aztec religion was the belief in multiple gods, each holding specific roles and responsibilities within their cosmology. One of the most significant deities was Huitzilopochtli, the god of sun and war, who served as the patron god of the Aztecs and played a crucial role in their migration to Tenochtitlan, their capital city. Other important gods included Tlaloc, the rain god; Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent god; and Tezcatlipoca, the god of destiny and rulership.  Rituals and ceremonies were integral to Aztec religious practices, performed by priests in elaborately adorned temples. The Aztecs believed that their gods required constant nourishment and offerings to sustain their powers and maintain the order of the universe. Sacrifice, both human and animal, was a common practice in their religious rituals. The Aztecs believed that offering blood and hearts to the gods would ensure the continuity of life and prevent cosmic disorder.  Human sacrifice held a particularly significant place in Aztec religious ceremonies. The most well-known form of human sacrifice was the ritual of """"heart extraction,"""" where victims were chosen to be sacrificed to the gods. These victims, often prisoners of war or individuals from conquered territories, would be taken to the top of temples where their hearts would be ritually removed as an offering to the gods. The rituals were believed to ensure the sun's rising, the coming of rain, and fertility for crops.  The ritual of human sacrifice was not conducted lightly but rather in accordance with specific dates in the Aztec calendar and for particular purposes. Major events such as the consecration of a new temple, the coronation of a ruler, or the appeasement of a specific deity would necessitate large-scale sacrifices. The Aztecs believed that without such offerings, catastrophic events like droughts, famines, or even the end of the world could occur.  Apart from human sacrifice, the Aztecs also performed ritualistic bloodletting ceremonies where individuals, including the ruling elite, would pierce themselves to offer their blood to the gods. These acts were seen as a form of penance or devotion, demonstrating the individual's commitment to their faith and the gods. Bloodletting was also believed to maintain the delicate balance between the earthly realm and the supernatural world.  Animal sacrifice was another common practice in Aztec religious rituals, often involving birds, snakes, and other animals. The choice of animal and the ritual involved would vary depending on the specific deity being honored or the nature of the ceremony. Animal sacrifices were considered essential for agricultural fertility and prosperity, as well as for ensuring protection in times of war or conflict.  The Aztecs' religious practices and sacrifices were not solely focused on appeasing the gods but also served to unify the community and reinforce social hierarchies. Priests played a central role in conducting the rituals, interpreting omens, and communicating with the divine. Through their religious ceremonies, the Aztecs reinforced the importance of their gods in everyday life and the interconnectedness of the spiritual and physical worlds.  Despite the centrality of sacrifice in Aztec religious practices, it is crucial to note that their civilization was also rich in art, architecture, poetry, and intellectual achievements. The Aztecs were skilled astronomers, mathematicians, and artists, creating intricate sculptures, pottery, and codices that reflected their cosmology and beliefs. While human sacrifice is often the focus of discussions on Aztec religion, it is essential to acknowledge the complexity and depth of their cultural and spiritual practices beyond this controversial aspect.  In conclusion, Aztec religious practices and sacrifices were deeply ingrained in their beliefs and cultural identity. The Aztecs viewed the offering of sacrifices as essential for maintaining the order of the universe, ensuring the well-being of their society, and honoring their gods. While the practice of human sacrifice may be unsettling to modern sensibilities, it is essential to understand it within the context of the Aztecs' worldview and the significance they attached to their religious rituals. Studying Aztec religion provides a fascinating glimpse into the beliefs, values, and complex rituals of this ancient civilization, shedding light on their understanding of the divine and the interconnectedness of the spiritual and earthly realms.""","964"
"Proffatt John","""It was held that as to this property in the United States Kosciusko died intestate; and that, on the principle that personal property, wherever it may be, is to be distributed, in case of intestacy, according to the law of the domicile of the intestate, that the disposition of this property should be governed by the law of France, the proper domicile of Kosciusko. There was some difficulty to ascertain the domicile, but it was shown that he did not leave Poland compulsorily, which would be an important consideration in determining his intent; but he left voluntarily to obtain a civil status in France, which he conscientiously thought he could not enjoy in Poland whilst it continued under a foreign dominion. With regard to real estate, a different rule prevails. It would not comport with the dignity or independence of one country to allow real property, which by its nature is fixed and immovable, to be controlled and affected by foreign laws. Hence it is the law of the place where the real estate is situated that governs in its distribution, and as to the proper execution of a will devising it. This is expressed by the formula that the lex locus rei sit governs. Thus, a devise of lands in England, though made abroad, must be executed pursuant to the English statute. Thus, where C made his will abroad, devising lands in England, but the same was executed in the presence of two witnesses, (three being necessary, at the time of its execution, to devise lands in England) in accordance with the law where he was domiciled, it was held that the will must be void as to lands in England, which lands can only pass by such a will as the laws of England require, and that the lex rei sit should govern. And if a testator, by his will, direct personal property to be invested, in another State, in certain trusts of real estate there lawful, but not lawful by the law of the State where the testator is domiciled, the trusts will be declared void. This was the case where a testator, a resident of the State of New York at the time of his death, who, by his will, directed his personal property and the proceeds of his real estate there situated to be invested in real estate in the State of Ohio, upon trusts which were invalid by the law of New York, it was held that the devise in trust was invalid, as it was inconsistent with the law of the testator's domicile. Jarman considers that a will of realty is construed according to the law of the country where the land is situated; but Story, Greenleaf, and others are of opinion that this doctrine of the lex rei sit does not apply to the construction, as distinguished from the execution, of wills. There are several American authorities on either side, the balance, however, being in favor of the law as stated by Jarman. A will has always been presumed, in England, to speak only from the death of the testator as to personalty, but before 838, from its date as to realty. By Vict., Ch. 6, devises and bequests were to be from death of the testator, unless a contrary intention appears. The rules thus settled by this act have long been adopted in most of our States. A will is presumed in the following States to speak only from the testator's death, as regards the subject- the testator's bounty: California, Maryland, Missouri, New York, and Pennsylvania. In Virginia, wills of land speak from the making of the instrument, unless it discloses an intention to the contrary. It is so in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina, Connecticut, and Kentucky; though a testator may, in these States, convey by his will any after-acquired land, provided he declares his intention to that effect. The construction, however, on these statutes virtually raises a presumption that wills speak only from the death of the testator, if there is nothing in the context to the contrary. It seems the better opinion, that the law of the domicile of the testator will govern as to what shall be regarded as personal estate, and what real. Thus, in Kentucky, shares in the capital stock of railroad companies are considered as real property, and, according to this rule, a will made by a person domiciled there must be executed as a will of real estate, to convey such shares. And the law of the place of domicile must govern as to what ought to be regarded as testamentary capacity. Thus, in England, administration was granted upon the probate of the will of a married woman, domiciled in Spain, she being also a native of that country, it appearing that by the law of that country a feme covert may dispose of her property by will, with certain limitations, the same as a feme sole. VIII. OF. It is obvious that within the scope of the present work it is inexpedient to treat of this subject extensively; it is considered only necessary to advert to a few of the leading and generally recognized rules followed in the construction of wills, both here and in England. The main purpose, in this direction, is to ascertain the true intention of the testator, from the language used in the instrument, and this intention shall prevail above every other construction which might be placed on the language. This is the cardinal rule of all construction, but it is to be taken with this limitation, that the intention will govern only so far as it is consistent with the rules of law. The general intent overrides all mere technical and grammatical rules of construction. This intention is to be ascertained from the whole will taken together, from a full view of everything contained within 'the four corners of the instrument,' and not from the language of any particular provision when taken by itself; and, for the purpose of construction, a will and codicil may be considered together, and construed as different parts of the same instrument. But where several parts are absolutely irreconcilable, the latter must prevail. The rule as to intention, governing in all cases, is somewhat liable to misconception, because it is susceptible of, and may be taken in, two senses. For by intention, it may be inferred that we are to seek for some probable purpose as existing in the testator's mind at the time; or may seek to extract that intention from the meaning of the language which he has used. It is in this latter sense alone in which construction is employed. The will must be in writing, and the only question is, what is the meaning of the words used in that writing? And to ascertain this, every part of it must be considered, with the help of those surrounding circumstances which are admissible in evidence to explain the words, and to put the court as nearly as possible in the situation of the writer. This was well expressed in Cole v. Rawlinson, by Lord Holt when he said: 'The intent of a testator will not do, unless there be sufficient words in the will to manifest that intent; neither is the intent to be collected from the circumstances of his estate, and other matters collateral and foreign to the will, but from the words and tenor of the will itself.' The rule was well illustrated in the case of Doe v. Dring, where a testator, intending, no doubt, to dispose of all his property for the benefit of his family, used these words: 'All and singular my effects of what nature and kind soever.' Lord Ellenborough said, that if he were asked his private opinion as to what the testator really meant when he used these words, he would reply, that he must be supposed to have meant that which his duty prescribed to him, to convey all his property for the maintenance of his family; but as a judge, he was not at liberty to collect his meaning from matters dehors, but only from expressions used on the face of the will, and that the expression 'effects' had always a meaning, in the absence of anything in the context, which necessarily excluded real estate. However, if the context shows that by the expression, 'all my personal estates,' the testator meant to include real property, it will be so held by reason of the clear intention manifested on the face of the will. An introductory clause expressing a testator's desire to dispose of all the property he should 'leave behind him' may be referred to, to construe the will as passing all lands belonging to the testator at the time of his death. It is one of the most troublesome questions in law, as to how far parol evidence can be admitted to ascertain the intention of a testator. The principle was early established, that parol evidence should not be admitted to vary, contradict, or enlarge the terms of a will, and this is still rigidly adhered to. This was well established in what is known as Lord Cheney's Case, where it is said that 'otherwise it were great inconvenience that not any may know by the written words of the will what construction to make, if it might be controlled by collateral averment, out of the will.' Chancellor Kent, in Mann v. Mann, examined this subject with much industry and learning, and declared the result to be: that from Cheney's Case down to this day, it has been a well-settled rule that parol evidence cannot be admitted to supply or contradict, enlarge or vary the words of a will, nor to explain the intention of the testator, except in two specific cases: st. Where there is a latent ambiguity arising dehors the will, as to the person or subject meant to be described; and d. To rebut a resulting trust.""","""Intestate Succession and Will Construction""","2002","""Intestate Succession and Will Construction are critical aspects of estate planning that dictate how an individual's assets are distributed in the event of their passing. Intestate succession comes into play when a person dies without a valid will, while will construction deals with interpreting the intentions laid out in a will. Both processes are essential in ensuring that a decedent's wishes are carried out and that their assets are distributed according to the law.  Intestate succession refers to the legal process by which the assets of an individual who has passed away without a will are distributed. In this scenario, state laws step in to determine how assets, such as property, finances, and personal belongings, will be allocated among the deceased person's heirs. These laws vary from state to state but generally follow a hierarchy of inheritance based on the familial relationship of potential beneficiaries. Typically, the surviving spouse and children are the first in line to inherit, followed by other relatives such as parents, siblings, or more distant relatives if no immediate family exists. Intestate succession laws aim to provide a fair and equitable distribution of assets among family members in the absence of a will.  On the other hand, will construction involves interpreting the terms of a will to ascertain the decedent's intentions regarding asset distribution. Even when a will exists, disputes can arise over its interpretation, leading to will construction issues. Courts may be called upon to resolve ambiguities in the language used, contradictions within the document, or challenges to the validity of the will itself. Will construction aims to ensure that the testator's wishes are carried out faithfully and in accordance with the law. It is crucial to have a clear and unambiguous will to minimize the potential for disputes among beneficiaries and to accurately reflect the testator's intentions.  In the context of will construction, several legal doctrines and principles come into play. The plain meaning rule states that the terms of a will should be interpreted in their ordinary and natural sense, without resorting to extrinsic evidence unless necessary. This rule upholds the principle of giving effect to the testator's words as they are written in the will. The doctrine of ademption deals with situations where a specific gift mentioned in the will no longer exists at the time of the testator's death. In such cases, the gift may fail or be replaced by another asset. The rule against perpetuities limits the duration of certain provisions in a will to ensure that assets are not tied up indefinitely but are distributed within a reasonable timeframe.  Challenges to will construction can arise when beneficiaries or interested parties contest the validity of a will or raise concerns about the interpretation of its terms. Common reasons for contesting a will include allegations of undue influence, lack of capacity on the part of the testator, fraud, or improper execution of the document. Resolving these disputes often involves a thorough examination of the evidence and testimony provided by involved parties to determine the true intentions of the testator.  In conclusion, both intestate succession and will construction play vital roles in estate planning and asset distribution. Intestate succession provides a framework for distributing assets when no will exists, while will construction ensures that the wishes expressed in a will are carried out accurately. By understanding the processes involved in these areas of estate law and seeking professional guidance when necessary, individuals can effectively plan for the future and safeguard their assets for the benefit of their loved ones.""","672"
"Sessions Roger","""The valid works and personalities are infinitely more complex than the ideas which constitute merely one of many components. At the same time, ideas influence not only the conscious efforts of composers, not only the criteria and the judgments of critics, but they influence, in the United States far more than in Europe, education and the general tenor of music life. Repeated mention has been made of a predilection, in the American mode of thought, for abstraction. This tendency derives from the necessity of building, fast, a foundation where a strong, complex influence of ancient tradition is lacking. Other peoples are inclined toward abstraction, too, but in comparison at least with Europe, here the ascendancy of certain concepts, ideas, and personalities is, at least on the surface, nearly uncontested. Equally striking is the finality, at times not as real as it may seem, with which the same concept, idea or personality can be superseded. These processes may be observed in many aspects of American life; and the concern with which they are viewed by those following the currents of opinion, is well known. However, countercurrents exist, frequently lost from view even when they are strongest. With the full glare of publicity concentrated on whatever is momentarily in the ascendance, countercurrents easily grow in quasi-silence and emerge at the appointed moment with a strength disconcerting to those not acquainted with the processes of American the taste of the majority, nor by seeking to limit the musical vocabulary to what is easily understood. Agreed: we live in a difficult, a transitional and hence a dangerous period, in which the individual frequently finds himself in an isolated position, in which society seems to become increasingly uncohesive, more unwieldy, and therefore prone to seek common ground on the most facile and oversimplified level. The fact remains that what the public really wants from music, in the last analysis, is neither the mirrored image of itself nor fare chosen for easy digestibility, but vital and relevant experience. The composer can furnish such experience by writing from the plenitude of complete conviction, and without constraint. One cannot hope ever to convince anyone unless one has convinced ones self; and this is the composers sole means of contact with any public whatever. He has no choice other than to be completely himself: the only alternative for an artist is not to be one. This opinion is no offer of an alternative solution to the American musical problem: it does not exclude musical nationalism or any other movement of that type; it does not exclude any kind of music whatever. It establishes premises which allow the free development of any music composers feel impelled to furnish. Music life today is infinitely varied, and there are all kinds of music, for every purpose and every occasion. This variety has developed as a natural consequence of modern life, and in fact is a part of it. An exclusive, dogmatic concept which would aim to limit this variety, or which would deny the validity of this or that type of music, is ridiculous. However, we must insist on distinctions and on the criteria that go with distinctions. It is not to the music or the concept of music--folklorist, evocative, popular, choose an adjective at will--that one should object, but to the exclusivity of a system of values which pretends to furnish criteria relevant to the development of music. Certainly the adjectives have meaning, but in a different sphere. The great line of western tradition provides the most fertile source of nourishment also for American music. This is now being recognized almost universally throughout the United States: and the recognition appears as the premise for our music education, criticism, and, in fact, for the responsible agencies of our entire music life. Today one hears very little of musical nationalism. It has been relegated to the provinces. The eternal quarrel between what is esoteric and what popular has evolved into a quite urbane, almost friendly argument between diatonicism and chromaticism, the tonalists and the atonalists, or with overtones resounding from a very recent past, between neoclassicism and the twelve-tone music.""","""American music culture and evolution""","837","""American music culture is a vibrant tapestry woven with threads of diverse genres, artists, and influences that have evolved over centuries. From the folk tunes of indigenous tribes to the chart-topping hits of today, American music reflects the country's rich history, social dynamics, and cultural melting pot. The evolution of American music is a fascinating journey that encompasses various styles such as blues, jazz, rock, hip-hop, country, and pop, each contributing to the unique musical landscape that has captivated audiences worldwide.  One of the foundational pillars of American music is the blues, which originated in the Deep South during the late 19th century. Rooted in African musical traditions and experiences of slavery and oppression, the blues emerged as a powerful expression of pain, resilience, and hope. Artists like Robert Johnson, B.B. King, and Muddy Waters popularized the genre, influencing a wide range of musical styles that followed.  In the early 20th century, jazz took center stage in American music, blending African rhythms with European harmonies to create a dynamic and improvisational genre. Legendary figures like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Ella Fitzgerald revolutionized jazz, inspiring generations of musicians and shaping the cultural landscape of the time. Jazz became synonymous with the Harlem Renaissance, a period of artistic and cultural flourishing in African American communities.  The rise of rock and roll in the 1950s brought a seismic shift to the music scene, challenging social norms and igniting a youth revolution. Artists like Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard defied conventions with their electrifying performances and rebellious spirit. Rock and roll became a symbol of freedom, self-expression, and cultural revolution, influencing fashion, attitudes, and popular culture.  The 1960s saw the emergence of folk music as a powerful tool for social and political activism. Icons like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Pete Seeger used their music to protest war, advocate for civil rights, and inspire change. The folk music movement not only entertained but also educated and mobilized audiences, highlighting the power of music as a vehicle for social justice.  As the 20th century progressed, new genres continued to emerge, each adding a layer to the ever-expanding tapestry of American music. The 1970s brought disco, funk, and punk rock, while the 1980s saw the rise of hip-hop and electronic dance music. Country music also flourished, with artists like Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, and Garth Brooks carving out a distinct place in the musical landscape.  The digital age of the 21st century has revolutionized the way music is created, distributed, and consumed. Streaming platforms, social media, and online communities have democratized the industry, allowing independent artists to reach global audiences without traditional gatekeepers. The internet has spurred a renaissance of musical creativity, with genres blending and evolving at a rapid pace.  Today, American music continues to push boundaries, defy categorization, and reflect the diverse voices and experiences of a multicultural society. Artists like Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, and Childish Gambino embody the spirit of innovation and experimentation, challenging conventions and shaping the future of music.  In conclusion, American music culture is a dynamic tapestry of tradition, innovation, and diversity that reflects the country's complex history and social dynamics. From the blues to hip-hop, from jazz to pop, the evolution of American music is a testament to the power of creativity, resilience, and self-expression. As new generations of artists continue to push the boundaries of sound and style, the legacy of American music culture remains a vibrant and essential part of the global musical landscape.""","739"
"Keppel Frederick P  Frederick Paul ","""First of all, the scholar must be a real scholar; he must have the natural ability and the long and rigorous training necessary for accurate observation, and observation of the kind which, if I may be forgiven a most unscholarly metaphor, includes the ability to distinguish the blue chips from the white; his deductions must be relentless, and his inductions must be luminous. That is asking a good deal, and it would be enough if his dealings were to be with other scholars or with scholars in the making. The papers of a leisurely recluse can be dug out by others from the even more deliberately published proceedings of learned societies, even as the author has dug out those of his predecessors, and ultimately the practical application of his discoveries will be made. In national emergency, however, this process will not suffice. The scholar must descend from his tower; he must, if he is to serve effectively, learn to think to order and to do it rapidly, to deal with all sorts and conditions of men; he must bear with their amazing ignorances and profit by their equally amazing knowledge of things of which he is ignorant. He must know the art of team play. The war has brought out a new type of scholarship, or at any rate has developed it to such an extent that its implications are new, and that is the unselfish cooperation of experts to meet a given and usually an immediately pressing need. The development of the Liberty motor furnishes a good example of the results of such cooperative effort. It seems to me that the most important single lesson which our scholars can learn from the experience of the two past years is the importance of this team play in scholarship, and not only team play with other scholars, but team play with those who have the equally valuable and perhaps even rarer gift of getting things done, who perhaps deserve the title of scholars in the control of time and space. The scholars who made good were those who had had not only the training and temperament for research, but the training and temperament for working with other people. The scholarship of the man who from self-centeredness or from a mistaken absorption in his specialty lacked the art of dealing with his fellow men was likely to prove a sterile scholarship, and in most cases a useless scholarship in the day of national need. One of the most dramatic things about the war was the speeding up of supply and transport under the strong hand of the man who had brought the Panama Canal to completion. General Goethals was no administrative theorist. He was willing to try anything and anybody once, but he was prompt in rejecting what did not promptly accomplish his purpose. An engineer of General Goethals' distinction can be regarded as a scholar in his particular field; but the point I want to make is that during his service as Quartermaster-General, when officers of the regular army and over-night majors, as they were called, presidents of manufacturing plants, bankers and lawyers, were passing in what seemed to be an almost unbroken procession through his office, he retained just two men in his inner circle from first to last, and both were academic persons. Herbert Hoover surrounded himself with scholars, entomologists, statisticians and public health men. He did not always use them for their specialties, but he evidently liked the type. The great welfare societies did the same, and the list of academic men whom they used makes an impressive total. These instances are typical of a very general success among scholars in cooperating effectively and helpfully with eminently practical men. This may be because the scholar has been trained in a form of competition which the so-called practical man lacked. He is used to having his work wiped out by some discovery of a rival, and having to begin afresh. He is used to a checking of his work by his fellows which, if of a different nature, is no less relentless than the war-time check in the toll of human lives. The man of high reputation in business often failed because he had learned to measure success and his own competence only in terms of dividends, and in the new test he found his measuring-rod worse than useless. Our scholars of the cooperative type not only pursued their researches, but they got their military associates into the habit of thinking in terms of scholarship. One of their most useful accomplishments, initiated by a Doctor of Philosophy of this University, was the organization of Thursday evening conferences for the discussion of the new scientific and technical problems facing the Army and Navy. This furnished a nucleus for the exchange of ideas between the different research groups, both here and abroad; for scholarship was mobilized and utilized in France, England, and Italy, as well as here, and our Allies laid their scientific discoveries before us with the greatest loyalty. At these conferences their reports were discussed and digested and applied, instead of being pigeon-holed at the War College, as I fear might have been otherwise the case. It was as a result of one of these conferences that a member of this Chapter, acting on a hint which came from a French report, was largely instrumental in developing a method of submarine detection through sound-waves of a particular type, which, though it came too late to be of service in the war, may serve in peace to relieve the greatest terror of the mariner, the danger of collision in darkness or fog with sister vessel or iceberg or derelict. A potent factor in breaking down the barriers and delays of departmental jealousies and bureaucratic tradition all along the line was the free-masonry of the company of scholars in Washington. It must not be forgotten that our scholar in war worked under two powerful stimuli, neither of them operative under ordinary conditions. Although he was out of his accustomed setting, working with strange people and at strange tasks, nevertheless the realization of the national need and the joy of feeling an identification with the forces facing the adversary tended to produce that fine frenzy which enables a man to do better than he knows how. Then, for the first time in history, the scholar had unlimited funds. It is an interesting subject for speculation as to how he can ever go back to the limits of academic appropriations. It is to be feared that in many cases he will not, but will turn to industrial enterprises instead. If, however, there was an unlimited supply of funds, there was a corresponding deficiency in time, and the scholar who could not speed up to meet the new conditions had little chance to make his mark. The men who failed in war because they could not grasp the significance of the time factor may, however, still be eminently useful in peace. On the other hand, the training which some of our scholars received in meeting another war-time condition is likely to have an important influence upon the relation of scholarship to industry. Many a scholar found for the first time that to meet a given condition a beautiful laboratory solution may be no solution at all, that the answer, to be effective, must meet the peculiar condition of quantity production. The merit of the Liberty engine, of which I have already spoken, lies not alone in the excellence of its design, admirable as that is, but in the fact that it is so constructed that we could produce fifteen hundred of them in a single week. Or, to take another example, in 914 we made all together eighteen hundred field glasses in this country. Last winter, thanks to the cooperation of the scholars in the chemistry of glass and in the field of optics on the one hand, and of the experts in quantity production on the other, we were making thirty-five hundred pairs of field glasses each week. There are many other adaptations of scholarship to industry that are awaiting similar practical solutions. One of our most distinguished scholars in physics has said publicly that the day is past when one can defend any distinction between pure and applied science. One might as well try to distinguish between pure and applied virtue. I said at the outset that I would venture later on an enlargement of the conception of the American scholar, in the light of what the past two years have made so clear. The scholar himself as well as those of us who are not scholars, needs, I think, to get a somewhat broader conception of the term; to develop it from its present popular connotation so that the attributes which come to one's mind will no longer be the static and selfish, but rather the dynamic and social. Emerson, in his essay on the American Scholar, seems to have some prophetic glimpse of this broader conception. He says, for example, that 'action is with the scholar subordinate, but it is essential; that without it, he is not yet man; that the true scholar grudges every opportunity of action passed by, as a loss of power'; and elsewhere, 'that a great soul will be strong to live, as well as strong to think.' The old idea of the scholar was the recluse, the individual; the new, it seems to me, should be one of a company of builders, each bringing to the common task, for the general welfare, his training and craft, his knowledge and ideas, to combine them with the gifts which his fellows are bringing. Thus far almost all my modern instances have been taken from the realms of natural science. I need not remind you, however, that although science has tremendously broadened the range of scholarship, nevertheless the scholarship which is a practical asset is not and never will be limited to natural science. The record of the past two years has many an example of the essentially important work of scholars in other fields.""","""Scholarship and cooperative teamwork in society.""","1916","""Scholarship and cooperative teamwork are two pillars of society that play crucial roles in driving progress, fostering innovation, and achieving collective goals. Both concepts are interwoven, with scholarship - the pursuit of knowledge and expertise - often serving as the foundation upon which effective teamwork operates. In this discussion, we will explore the significance of scholarship and cooperative teamwork in society, analyze how they complement each other, and delve into examples that highlight their impact across various fields.  Scholarship is the scholarly pursuit of academic excellence and the advancement of knowledge. It involves rigorous research, critical thinking, and intellectual curiosity, leading to discoveries, inventions, and breakthroughs in diverse fields such as science, technology, arts, and humanities. Scholars - whether they be scientists, artists, historians, or writers - contribute valuable insights, theories, and perspectives that push the boundaries of human understanding.  Moreover, scholarship enriches the collective knowledge of society, paving the way for progress and innovation. Through peer-reviewed publications, academic conferences, and educational institutions, scholars disseminate their findings and engage in intellectual dialogues that challenge existing paradigms and inspire new ways of thinking. Scholarship drives societal development by fostering a culture of learning, experimentation, and intellectual growth.  On the other hand, cooperative teamwork involves individuals coming together to collaborate towards a common goal. Teamwork harnesses the strengths and expertise of different individuals, allowing for synergy, efficiency, and enhanced problem-solving capabilities. When people work together cohesively, they can achieve outcomes that surpass what any single individual could accomplish alone.  Cooperative teamwork is essential in various aspects of society, including business, sports, healthcare, education, and community development. In business, cross-functional teams bring together employees with diverse skills and perspectives to drive innovation, improve processes, and deliver exceptional products and services. In healthcare, interdisciplinary teams collaborate to provide comprehensive patient care, combining medical expertise, technological advancements, and compassion to enhance outcomes.  The synergy between scholarship and cooperative teamwork is evident in how they complement each other to achieve collective success. Scholars often collaborate in research teams to address complex questions, share resources, and leverage each other's expertise. By working together, scholars can combine their intellectual strengths, conduct more comprehensive studies, and produce impactful findings that advance their respective fields.  Similarly, cooperative teamwork benefits from scholarly insights and expertise. In multidisciplinary teams, scholars bring specialized knowledge, critical thinking skills, and innovative approaches that foster creativity and problem-solving. Scholarly research can inform team decisions, provide evidence-based solutions, and enhance the overall effectiveness of collaborative efforts.  Looking at examples across different sectors, we see how scholarship and cooperative teamwork intersect to drive meaningful change. In scientific research, teams of researchers collaborate to tackle global challenges such as climate change, infectious diseases, and renewable energy. By pooling their expertise and resources, these teams can make groundbreaking discoveries, develop life-saving treatments, and pioneer sustainable technologies that benefit society as a whole.  In the arts and humanities, collaborative projects bring together artists, writers, historians, and curators to create exhibitions, publications, and performances that engage audiences, provoke critical discourse, and preserve cultural heritage. Through interdisciplinary collaborations, these creative teams amplify their impact, reach new audiences, and contribute to the enrichment of society's cultural landscape.  In conclusion, scholarship and cooperative teamwork are indispensable drivers of progress, innovation, and societal advancement. Scholars push the boundaries of knowledge, while teamwork harnesses collective strengths to achieve common goals. By recognizing the interplay between scholarship and teamwork, we can cultivate a culture of collaboration, intellectual inquiry, and collective achievement that propels society forward into a brighter future.""","721"
"Fawcett Millicent Garrett Dame","""We asked him to receive us, but he refused to meet us or to hold any communication with us on the subject. His position, therefore, was that his promises remained unredeemed, and he made no effort to redeem them. It is true that he offered parliamentary time for the discussion of a Second Reading of a private Member's Bill. But it needed not to be a Daniel or a Solomon to see that a private Member's Bill, of which seven had passed Second Reading in the last four years, and four of them in 908, 909, 910, and 911, was no substitute for a place in a Government Bill, which, if adopted by the House, would be regarded by the Government as an integral part of the measure, and defended in all its stages in both Houses of Parliament. We were furiously indignant. If a man who had owed,00 suddenly became bankrupt, and declined any meeting with his creditors, but offered them,00 gilded cardboard discs, he could not expect this conduct to assuage their indignation or soften their anger against him, for he would first have robbed them and then treated them as if they were children. One of the papers which usually supported the Government put the case thus: 'If A and B arrange a deal, and A is unavoidably prevented from delivering the goods for which B bargained, it is not open to A to offer a different class of goods till he has had B's consent to the substitution.' We remembered how, when the militant suffragists had said that Mr. Asquith's promises were worthless, Mr. Lloyd George had indignantly and forcibly retaliated that such a doubt was 'an imputation of deep dishonour' which he absolutely repudiated. We took pleasure in recalling Dr. Johnson's description of the Duke of Devonshire of his time, and contrasting it with Mr. Asquith, to the latter's disadvantage. 'If,' said the Doctor of the third Duke, 'he had promised you an acorn and none had grown in his woods that year, he would not have contented himself with that excuse; he would have sent to Denmark for it. So unconditional was he in keeping his word, so high his point of honour.' If that was the sort of man the Duke of Devonshire was, it was the sort of man Mr. Asquith was not. The N.U.W.S.S. decided at its council meeting in February, 913, to take no part in supporting by work in the constituencies or inside the House this private Member's Bill. Our reasons were that we were now convinced that nothing but a Government Bill, backed by a united Cabinet, would be of any practical service to our cause. Of course the N.U.W.S.S. could never, under any circumstances, oppose any Bill which enfranchised any women, few or many; but we took no part whatever in its support. It came on for Second Reading in May, 913, and met with the defeat to which from the beginning it had been foredoomed. The last four years had witnessed the steady advance of the suffrage cause. It was now in the forefront of practical politics, and was a question which had led to more than one serious Cabinet crisis, and was capable of making or unmaking Governments. We held steadfastly to our resolution to work for nothing in Parliament but a Government measure backed by a united Cabinet. Our chief practical consideration was how to do this on constitutional lines and by non-party means. Our friend and colleague, Mrs. Harley, suggested what we afterwards called 'The Pilgrimage,' and her idea was taken up and carried out with enthusiasm by the whole National Union. An account of the Pilgrimage will form the subject of the next chapter. V THE AND THE DAY, 913 'Proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.' LEV. xxv. 0. The Pilgrimage was a piece of work which could only have been undertaken successfully by a powerful organization, and such the N.U.W.S.S. certainly was. We had divided the whole area of Great Britain into nineteen federations; in each federation there was a working committee meeting regularly, whose aim was to form a non-militant, non-party women's suffrage society in every parliamentary borough in its area. Each federation and each society aimed at being self-supporting; but the large sums, amounting to many thousands of pounds, collected at our big Albert Hall demonstrations in London enabled the executive committee of the whole N.U.W.S.S. to make grants for special work to specified societies or federations. Our organization was thoroughly democratic, the executive committee and all the officers being subject to election at our annual council meetings, where each society could claim representation in proportion to its numbers. No new departure in policy could be undertaken without the authority of the council. In 913 we had over 00 societies, and they were constantly increasing; in 914, just before the war, there were over 00. We calculated that, adding together the central funds, the Election Fighting Fund, and the funds raised and expended by our societies locally, the National Union at this time was using over 5/8,00 a year for the furtherance of the enfranchisement of women. We were giving full time employment to scores of organizers, mostly highly intelligent young women of University education, who not only did admirable propaganda work throughout the country, but kept headquarters informed of all important local developments and incidents bearing on our movement. The Pilgrimage was a march of bands of our societies, all non-militant suffragists, from every part of Great Britain, converging on London, and so arranged as to reach their goal on the same day. Eight routes were selected: the great North Road, the Fen Country, the East Coast, Watling Street, the West Country Road, the Portsmouth Road, the Brighton Road, and the Kentish Pilgrims' Way. In each case the Pilgrimage procession started at the point most distant from London, carrying banners, and accompanied, where possible, by music. The pilgrims were prepared to stop and hold meetings, distribute literature, and collect funds in towns and villages en route. As they proceeded their numbers rolled up; friends lent motor-cars for conveying luggage, and the most wonderfully generous hospitality was extended to them all along the route, especially in the towns where we had powerful societies. This we might have been said to expect; but what surprised us was the extraordinarily warm welcome we received from the villages we passed through. Once their inhabitants understood that we were non-militant, and had no desire to injure anybody or anything, they gave us the most cordial reception; indeed, we were often stopped as we were passing through villages which we had deemed hardly large enough for a meeting with the remonstrance, 'You are surely never going to pass us by without saying a word!' The meetings in the towns were not so uniformly friendly. Hooligans sometimes declined to believe that we were non-militant, and demonstrated their enthusiasm for law and order by throwing dead rats, potatoes, rotten eggs, and other garbage, at our speakers. No real harm was done to any of us, but occasionally the services of the police were needed to protect our speakers. This, however, was exceptional, and had reactions in our favour. For instance, one lady, well on her way towards old age, who had started on our Pilgrimage at Land's End, originally intended to break off her march at Plymouth, but, being roughly treated by a band of disorderly youths at Camborne, resolved that she would accompany the pilgrims all the way to London, which she did. The start was made in each case from the points most distant from London on June 8th, and the Pilgrimage in all its eight branches arrived in London on July 5/8th, the final demonstration being held in Hyde Park on July 6th. Here there were nineteen platforms, representing the nineteen federations of the N.U.W.S.S. There was a huge and an entirely sympathetic crowd in the Park. When a bugle sounding from the central platform announced the putting of the resolution, there was hardly a hand held up against it. On the next day Sunday, July 7th many hundreds of the pilgrims, wearing their badges and colours, assembled in Trafalgar Square and walked in procession, but without banners, to St. Paul's to attend the afternoon service. A large number of seats had been courteously reserved for them under the dome, and a sermon appropriate to the occasion was preached by Canon Simpson. We thought it just like our good luck that the first Psalm for the evening service on the twenty-seventh day of the month was the absolutely appropriate one: 'When the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion, then were we like unto them that dream. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth on his way weeping, and bearing forth good seed, shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.' A deep sense of peace and of absolute confidence in our ultimate triumph came upon us. We were as certain of it as if it had already been in our grasp. It may not be inappropriate here to add a few words about Mrs. Harley, who originated the Pilgrimage. She was a woman of great originality and imagination. The widow of a soldier, and sister of General French, she had lived most of her life among military people and in a military atmosphere. She was the life and soul of the suffrage movement in Shrewsbury and the neighbourhood, where her fine character has left a lasting impression.""","""Women's Suffrage Movement Strategies and Actions""","1993","""The Women's Suffrage Movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was a pivotal period in history that sought to secure women's right to vote and participate in the democratic process. At the forefront of this movement were individuals and organizations who employed a range of strategies and actions to achieve their goal. These strategies were diverse, creative, and often groundbreaking, reflecting the resilience and determination of women fighting for their rights.  One of the key strategies adopted by the suffragists was peaceful activism and public demonstrations. Women organized marches, rallies, and protests to raise awareness about their cause and draw attention to the injustice of their disenfranchisement. These public displays of unity and solidarity helped to build momentum and galvanize support for the movement. Notable events like the Women's Suffrage Parade in Washington D.C. in 1913, led by Alice Paul, showcased the strength and resolve of suffragists in the face of adversity.  Another critical strategy was the use of civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance. Suffragists engaged in acts of defiance, such as picketing outside the White House, going on hunger strikes in prison, and engaging in peaceful sit-ins. These acts of resistance were aimed at challenging the status quo, highlighting the hypocrisy of denying women the right to vote in a democracy, and putting pressure on lawmakers to enact change.  In addition to public activism, suffragists also utilized legal avenues to challenge discriminatory laws and policies. Organizations like the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and the National Woman's Party (NWP) worked tirelessly to lobby politicians, file lawsuits, and advocate for constitutional amendments that would guarantee women the right to vote. The passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which granted women suffrage, was a testament to the effectiveness of these legal strategies.  Furthermore, suffragists recognized the power of education and the media in shaping public opinion. They published newspapers, pamphlets, and books to educate the public about the importance of women's suffrage and to counter misinformation and stereotypes about women's capabilities. Suffragists also leveraged their connections with sympathetic journalists and activists to generate positive media coverage and promote their cause.  Importantly, the Women's Suffrage Movement was inclusive and intersectional, with women from diverse backgrounds coming together to demand their rights. Women of color, such as Ida B. Wells and Sojourner Truth, played crucial roles in the movement, advocating for both women's suffrage and racial equality. Their contributions highlighted the interconnected nature of social justice issues and inspired future generations of activists to continue the fight for equality.  In conclusion, the Women's Suffrage Movement employed a multifaceted approach to advocate for women's right to vote. Through a combination of peaceful protest, civil disobedience, legal advocacy, education, and inclusivity, suffragists made significant strides towards achieving their goal. The strategies and actions of these courageous individuals laid the foundation for women's participation in the democratic process and continue to inspire ongoing efforts for gender equality and social justice.""","616"
"Bradley Glenn D  Glenn Danford ","""Russell at once awoke to the situation. While a loyal citizen and fully alive to the strategic importance which the matter involved, he also believed that he saw a good business opening. Could his firm but grasp the opportunity, and demonstrate the possibility of keeping the Central route open during the winter months, and could they but lower the schedule of the Panama line, a Government contract giving them a virtual monopoly in carrying the transcontinental mail might eventually be theirs. He at once hurried West, and at Fort Leavenworth met his partners, Messrs. Majors and Waddell, to whom he confidently submitted the new proposition. Much to Russell's chagrin, these gentlemen were not elated over the plan. While passively interested, they keenly foresaw the great cost which a year around overland fast mail service would involve. They were unable to see any chance of the enterprise paying expenses, to say nothing of profits. But Russell, with cheerful optimism, contended that while the project might temporarily be a losing venture, it would pay out in time. He asserted that the opportunity of making good with a hard undertaking--one that had been held impossible of realization--would be a strong asset to the firm's reputation. He also declared that in his conversation with Gwin he had already committed their company to the undertaking, and he did not see how they could, with honor and propriety, evade the responsibility of attempting it. Knowledge of the last mentioned fact at once enlisted the support or his partners. Probably no firm has ever surpassed in integrity that of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, famous throughout the West in the freighting and mail business before the advent of railroads in that section of the men, the verbal promise of one of their number was a binding guarantee and as sacredly respected as a bonded obligation. Finding themselves thus committed, they at once began preparations with tremendous activity. All this happened early in the year 860. The first step was to form a corporation, the more adequately to conduct the enterprise; and to that end the Central Overland California and Pike's Peak Express Company was organized under a charter granted by the Territory of Kansas. Besides the three original members of the firm, the incorporators included General Superintendent B. F. Ficklin, together with F. A. Bee, W. W. Finney, and John S. Jones, all tried and trustworthy stage employees who were retained on account of their wide experience in the overland traffic business. The new concern then took over the old stage line from Atchison to Salt Lake City and purchased the mail route and outfit then operating between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The latter, which had been running a monthly round trip stage between these terminals, was known as the West End Division of the Central Route, and was called the Chorpenning line. Besides conducting the Pony Express, the corporation aimed to continue a large passenger and freighting business, so it next absorbed the Leavenworth and Pike's Peak Express Co., which had been organized a year previously and had maintained a daily stage between Leavenworth and Denver, on the Smoky Hill River Route. By mutual agreement, Mr. Russell assumed managerial charge of the Eastern Division of the Pony Express line which lay between St. Joseph and Salt Lake City. Ficklin was stationed at Salt Lake City, the middle point, in a similar capacity. Finney was made Western manager with headquarters at San Francisco. These men now had to revise the route to be traversed, equip it with relay or relief stations which must be provisioned for men and horses, hire dependable men as station-keepers and riders, and buy high grade horses or ponies for the entire course, nearly two thousand miles in extent. Between St. Joseph and Salt Lake City, the company had its old stage route which was already well supplied with stations. West of Salt Lake the old Chorpenning route had been poorly equipped, which made it necessary to erect new stations over much of this course of more than seven hundred miles. The entire line of travel had to be altered in many places, in some instances to shorten the distance, and in others, to avoid as much as possible, wild places where Indians might easily ambush the riders. The management was fortunate in having the assistance of expert subordinates. A. B. Miller of Leavenworth, a noteworthy employe of the original firm, was invaluable in helping to formulate the general plans of organization. At Salt Lake City, Ficklin secured the services of J. C. Brumley, resident agent of the company, whose vast knowledge of the route and the country that it covered enabled him quickly to work out a schedule, and to ascertain with remarkable accuracy the number of relay and supply stations, their best location, and also the number of horses and men needed. At Carson City, Nevada, Bolivar Roberts, local superintendent of the Western Division, hired upwards of sixty riders, cool-headed nervy men, hardened by years of life in the open. Horses were purchased throughout the West. They were the best that money could buy and ranged from tough California cayuses or mustangs to thoroughbred stock from Iowa. They were bought at an average figure of $00.0 each, a high price in those days. The men were the pick of the frontier; no more expressive description of their qualities can be given. They were hired at salaries varying from $0.0 to $5/80.0 per month, the riders receiving the highest pay of any below executive rank. When fully equipped, the line comprised 90 stations, about 20 horses, 00 station men and assistants and eighty riders. These are approximate figures, as they varied slightly from time to time. Perfecting these plans and assembling this array of splendid equipment had been no easy task, yet so well had the organizers understood their business, and so persistently, yet quietly, had they worked, that they accomplished their purpose and made ready within two months after the project had been launched. The public was scarcely aware of what was going on until conspicuous advertisements announced the Pony Express. It was planned to open the line early in April. While always called the Pony Express, there were many blooded horses as well as ponies in the service. The distinction between these types of animals is of course well known to the average reader. Probably 'Pony' Express 'sounded better' than any other name for the service, hence the adoption of this name by the firm and the public at large. This book will use the words horse and pony indiscriminately. Chapter III The First Trip and Triumph On March 6, 860, there appeared simultaneously in the St. Louis Republic and the New York Herald the following notice: To San Francisco in days by the Central Overland California and Pike's Peak Express Company. The first courier of the Pony Express will leave the Missouri River on Tuesday April rd at o'clock P. M. and will run regularly weekly hereafter, carrying a letter mail only. The point of departure on the Missouri River will be in telegraphic connection with the East and will be announced in due time. Telegraphic messages from all parts of the United States and Canada in connection with the point of departure will be received up to o'clock P. M. of the day of leaving and transmitted over the Placerville and St. Joseph telegraph wire to San Francisco and intermediate points by the connecting express, in days. The letter mail will be delivered in San Francisco in ten days from the departure of the Express. The Express passes through Forts Kearney, Laramie, Bridger, Great Salt Lake City, Camp Floyd, Carson City, The Washoe Silver Mines, Placerville, and Sacramento. Letters for Oregon, Washington Territory, British Columbia, the Pacific Mexican ports, Russian Possessions, Sandwich Islands, China, Japan and India will be mailed in San Francisco. Special messengers, bearers of letters to connect with the express the rd of April, will receive communications for the courier of that day at No. 81 Tenth St., Washington City, up to:5/8 P. M. on Friday, March 0, and in New York at the office of J. B. Simpson, Room No., Continental Bank Building, Nassau Street, up to:0 A. M. of March 1. Full particulars can be obtained on application at the above places and from the agents of the Company. This sudden announcement of the long desired fast mail route aroused great enthusiasm in the West and especially in St. Joseph, Missouri, Salt Lake City, and the cities of California, where preparations to celebrate the opening of the line were at once begun. Slowly the time passed, until the afternoon of the eventful day, April rd, that was to mark the first step in annihilating distance between the East and West. A great crowd had assembled on the streets of St. Joseph, Missouri. Flags were flying and a brass band added to the jubilation. The Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad had arranged to run a special train into the city, bringing the through mail from connecting points in the East. Everybody was anxious and excited. At last the shrill whistle of a locomotive was heard, and the train rumbled in--on time. The pouches were rushed to the post office where the express mail was made ready. The people now surge about the old 'Pike's Peak Livery Stables,' just South of Pattee Park. All are hushed with subdued expectancy. As the moment of departure approaches, the doors swing open and a spirited horse is led out. Nearby, closely inspecting the animal's equipment is a wiry little man scarcely twenty years old. Time to go! Everybody back! A pause of seconds, and a cannon booms in the distance--the starting signal. The rider leaps to his saddle and starts. In less than a minute he is at the post office where the letter pouch, square in shape with four padlocked pockets, is awaiting him.""","""Pony Express establishment and operation""","2043","""The Pony Express: A Glimpse into the Past  The Pony Express holds a significant place in the history of the United States, symbolizing the spirit of adventure, speed, and innovation during a crucial period of American expansion in the 19th century. Established in April 1860, the Pony Express was a short-lived yet legendary mail delivery service that revolutionized communication across vast territories, connecting the East and West coasts of the young nation. Let's delve into the establishment and operation of this iconic service, exploring the challenges faced by riders, the impact of the Pony Express on American history, and the enduring legacy it has left behind.  The concept of the Pony Express was conceived to address the need for a faster mail delivery system between Missouri and California. At the time, the existing overland mail service took weeks to transport letters across the country, while the telegraph lines were yet to be established. In response to this communication gap, the Pony Express was established by William H. Russell, William B. Waddell, and Alexander Majors of the firm Russell, Majors, and Waddell, with the goal of reducing the delivery time to a remarkable ten days.  The operational model of the Pony Express was based on a relay of horse-mounted riders who would cover a specified distance before handing the mail pouch to the next rider. The route spanned approximately 1,900 miles, from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California. The innovative approach of using a network of riders and relay stations enabled the Pony Express to achieve unprecedented speeds in delivering mail, with riders covering an average of 75 to 100 miles before changing horses at the 184 relay stations along the route.  Riders of the Pony Express were known for their bravery, skill, and endurance, as they faced numerous challenges during their journeys. Riding day and night, through harsh weather conditions, rugged terrain, and the constant threat of attacks by outlaws or Native American tribes, these riders embodied the spirit of the Wild West. The riders had to be lightweight, skilled horsemen to navigate the treacherous terrain efficiently and maintain the speed required for the timely delivery of mail.  Despite its innovative approach and rapid delivery times, the Pony Express faced financial challenges from the outset. The high costs of operating the service, including the need for fresh horses, experienced riders, and the constant threat of disruptions due to weather or attacks, made it difficult to sustain the venture. Additionally, the completion of the transcontinental telegraph line in October 1861, which could deliver messages almost instantly, rendered the Pony Express obsolete just a year and a half after its inception.  Although short-lived, the Pony Express left a lasting impact on American history and the popular imagination. It became a symbol of the adventurous spirit and can-do attitude of the pioneers who shaped the West. The Pony Express also played a vital role during its operation, providing a reliable means of communication during a time of rapid expansion and change in the United States.  The legacy of the Pony Express lives on in popular culture, with numerous books, films, and depictions keeping its memory alive. The daring exploits of the riders, the speed and efficiency of the service, and the sense of connection it fostered across the vast expanse of the country continue to captivate audiences and historians alike. The Pony Express stands as a testament to human ingenuity, perseverance, and the enduring quest for progress and connection.  In conclusion, the establishment and operation of the Pony Express represent a remarkable chapter in the history of American innovation and communication. Despite its short lifespan, the Pony Express achieved a remarkable feat in connecting the East and West coasts of the United States, leaving a lasting legacy of speed, daring, and determination that continues to inspire to this day. The Pony Express will forever be remembered as a symbol of the pioneering spirit that defines the American frontier.""","780"
"Kellogg Vernon L  Vernon Lyman ","""He had a disconcerting habit of starting in on a course and then if he found it uninteresting or unpromising as a contributor to the special education he was interested in, of simply dropping out of the class without consultation or permission. But he did dig hard into what he thought really counted; his record in the geology department was an unusually high one. But with all his work and study he found time for some other kinds of activity. At least the two Irwin boys, Will and Wallace, who were Stanford's most ingenious disturbers of the peace in pioneer days, claim that Hoover, in his quiet effective way, made a few contributions of his own to the troubles of the faculty. But such contributions from others were generally credited--or rather debited--to the more notorious offenders, so that they had to suffer not alone for their own brilliant inspirations but for those of other less conspicuous collaborators. Wallace, for what seemed to the faculty sufficient reasons, was, as he has himself phrased it, 'graduated by request,' while Will had his Senior year encored by the faculty, so that it took him five years, instead of the more conventional four, to graduate. In fact, I remember that even as this fifth year was drawing near its close, the faculty committee of discipline, of which I was a reluctant member, seriously considered letting Will go in the same way that Wallace had gone. But some of us argued that if we should let Will graduate in the more usual way we should be rid of him soon anyway and without risking the bare possibilities of doing him an injustice. President Jordan always maintained that Will had good stuff in him, and he used his ameliorating influence with the faculty committee. So Will Irwin is today one of Stanford's best-known alumni. Herbert Hoover's haunting trouble all through his college course was that unpassed entrance requirement in English composition. Indeed, he did not pass in it until about a week before he graduated, although he tried it regularly every semester all through his four years. How he finally got his passing mark has been told me by Mrs. Hoover. She knows because she was there through most of the long agony. After failing regularly at each semester's trial principally, he thinks (and Mrs. Hoover is inclined to agree), because he always had to take it under a particularly meticulous instructor, his predicament began to worry even his professors in the geology department. It looked as if their star student might not be allowed to graduate. Finally a date was set by the English department for a last trial before the end of his Senior year. A day or two before this date the professor of paleontology, J. P. Smith, famed not only for his erudition but for his especial kindness to all geology students--especially if they did well in paleontology--came to the worrying Senior with a paper that Hoover had written sometime before on a paleontological subject, and said to him: 'Look here, you will never pass that examination in the state you are in. Take this paper; it's fine. Copy it in your best hand; remember that handwriting goes a long way with professors of English; look up every word in the dictionary to be sure you have got the right one; then put in all the punctuation marks you ever saw, and bring it back to me.' Hoover did it. Then Professor Smith disappeared with the paper in his study, but soon came out with it, abundantly blue-penciled. 'Now take it and re-copy it with all these indicated changes, and bring it back again.' Again the interested Senior obeyed his mentor. Then the professor left the laboratory with the paper in his hand. Hoover awaited his return with ever-increasing interest. Pretty soon he came back with a cheerful smile, handed Hoover the paper, and said: 'Well, you've passed; although you probably don't deserve it.' Professor Smith, it seems, had carried the paper, not to the fatal instructor, but to the head of the English department and had said to him: 'See here; your instructor is holding up the best man we have from graduating. Now look at this paper of Hoover's. Is there anything the matter with it? Doesn't it make good sense? Isn't it well written? Isn't it well punctuated?' The English head glanced over it impatiently--he was translating Dante, his dearest recreation, at the moment--and then roared out: 'Well, it looks all right. I suppose Instructor X has to live up to the rules, but if the boy can do this well for you it's good enough for us.' And with his Dante pencil he wrote a large 'Passed' across the paper. Someway all this does not sound like an account of life at the conventional university. Nor does Professor J. P. Smith, who used to interrupt his lecture to wake up a dozing student with a sharp but kindly 'Here, Jack, wake up, this is an important point and I will surely ask about it in examination,' seem to be of the conventional type of professor. And most Freshmen coming to Yale or Harvard would hesitate a little before taking the advice of some workman about the campus to go, with bag and trunk, in search of board and lodging to a house full of professors. But as I said at the beginning, Stanford was different. It is precisely because it was, that Hoover's particular college experiences and acquisitions were what I have tried to suggest, and not what you might think they would be from your knowledge of other universities. And while Stanford has converged somewhat with years toward the more usual university type--colleges get more alike as they get older--it has still an atmosphere peculiarly its own. But it was in the first days that this atmosphere was so very distinctive. Its president and faculty and students, all living closely together in the middle of a great ranch of seven thousand acres of grain fields, horse paddocks, and hills where jack rabbits roamed and coyotes howled, were thrown together into one great family, whose members depended almost entirely on one another for social life. And each department was a special smaller family within the great one. Life was simple and direct and democratic. Real things counted first and most; there was little sophistication. Work was the order of the day; recreations were wholesome. The geology family was an especially close and happy one. Some of Dr. Branner's former assistants and students had followed him out to California. They were the older members of the family. Almost all of them are now well-known geologists and mining engineers. So also are many of his younger ones. The family went on long tramps and camps together. The region about Stanford is singularly interesting from a geologist's point of view; and in those days it was a terra more or less incognita. Everybody was discovering things. It was real live geology. Lectures and recitations were illustrated, not by lantern slides, but by views out of the window and revelations in the field. And at the same time these young geologists learned real life; they had come to know intimately real men and women, all fired with the enthusiasm of a new venture, new opportunities, and a high ideal. With all this, Herbert Hoover learned, in particular, one additional very important thing. He learned that a certain unusual girl, beautiful, intelligent, and unspoiled, a lover of outdoors, and, as proof of her unusualness, a 'major' student in geology, was the girl for him. Having learned this he decided to marry her. And later, she decided that he had decided right. And so with all his experience at earning his living by organizing anything needing organizing, and with his stores of geological lore gained from lecture room and textbook and field work and close personal association with his able and friendly professors, and, finally, with the knowledge that he had already found exactly the right girl for him, Herbert Hoover went out from Stanford, in 895/8, with his Pioneer Class, ready to open his oyster. But he had only himself to rely on in doing it. IV THE Herbert Hoover began his mining career very simply and practically by taking his place as a real workman in a real mine, with no favors shown, following in this the emphatic advice given by Dr. Branner to every student graduating from his department. He went up into the mining region near Grass Valley in the Sierras where he had already studied with Waldemar Lindgren, and became a regular miner, a boy-man with pick and shovel working long hours underground or sometimes on the surface about the plant. But always he had his eyes wide open and always he was learning. He preferred the underground work because he wanted first to know more about the actual occurrence of the ore in the earth than about the mill processes of extracting the mineral from it. Here he worked for several months, and gradually rose to the position of night shift-boss or gang foreman. But he began to realize that he was exhausting the learning opportunities of this particular place and kind of work, and so one night deep down in the mine, when for sudden lack of ore-cars or power or some other essential, work was held up for the last half hour of his shift, he went off into a warm corner, curled himself up in a nice clean wheelbarrow and slept away the last half hour of his pick and shovel experience. He had decided to get into association, some way, with the best mining engineer on the Coast. There was no question about who this was at that time. It was Louis Janin in San Francisco. So he appeared at Mr. Janin's office as a candidate for a job, any job so that it was a job under Louis Janin. But the famous engineer, well disposed as he was toward giving intelligent, earnest young men who wanted to become mining engineers, a chance, had to explain that not only was there no vacant place in his staff but that a long waiting list would have to be gone through before Hoover's turn could come.""","""Herbert Hoover's college experiences at Stanford""","2058","""Herbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States, had a notable academic journey at Stanford University that greatly influenced his later career in politics and as a humanitarian. Born in 1874 in Iowa, Hoover was raised as an orphan and went on to become one of the most distinguished alumni of Stanford. His college experiences provided him with a strong foundation in engineering, innovation, and leadership that shaped his future endeavors.  Hoover's time at Stanford began in 1891 when he enrolled as a member of the university's inaugural class. At the time, Stanford was a young university, having been founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their son. The institution was known for its progressive educational philosophy and emphasis on practical skills, which appealed to Hoover's interests in engineering and problem-solving.  During his years at Stanford, Hoover demonstrated remarkable academic prowess and a keen interest in geology, engineering, and business. He was heavily involved in campus activities and leadership roles, showcasing his early aptitude for organizational management and public service. Hoover's intellectual curiosity and work ethic earned him the respect of his peers and professors, setting the stage for his future success.  One defining aspect of Hoover's college experience was his involvement in the university's pioneering geology program. Under the mentorship of renowned geologist John Casper Branner, Hoover honed his skills in fieldwork and mineral exploration. This hands-on experience proved invaluable in shaping his later career as a mining engineer and geologist, laying the groundwork for his expertise in natural resource management.  Hoover's time at Stanford was also marked by his entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to public service. He was a founding member of the Stanford Mandolin and Banjo Club, showcasing his musical talents and social engagement. Additionally, Hoover co-founded the Stanford University Association, a student organization dedicated to promoting campus unity and philanthropy.  A pivotal moment in Hoover's college years was the devastation caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. As a senior at Stanford, Hoover played a crucial role in coordinating relief efforts and providing assistance to the affected communities. His leadership during this crisis garnered widespread acclaim and underscored his strong sense of civic duty and compassion for others.  After graduating from Stanford in 1895 with a degree in geology, Hoover embarked on a successful career in mining engineering and international business. His time at Stanford instilled in him a commitment to innovation, integrity, and public service that would define his subsequent achievements.  Hoover's college experiences at Stanford greatly influenced his approach to governance and humanitarian work later in life. As President of the United States from 1929 to 1933, Hoover faced the challenges of the Great Depression with a focus on individual initiative and volunteerism, reflecting his belief in self-reliance and community empowerment.  In addition to his political career, Hoover's legacy as a humanitarian stems from his efforts to provide relief and reconstruction aid in the aftermath of both World War I and World War II. Through organizations like the American Relief Administration and the Hoover Institution, he dedicated himself to alleviating suffering and promoting peace on a global scale.  Herbert Hoover's college experiences at Stanford University served as a formative period that shaped his character, values, and contributions to society. His dedication to education, innovation, and public service continues to inspire future generations of leaders and scholars. Stanford remains proud of its association with Hoover, recognizing him as a distinguished alum whose legacy exemplifies the university's commitment to excellence and service to humanity.""","701"
"Jastrow Morris","""The road to the place is full of dangers, but Gilgamesh, undaunted, undertakes the journey. The hero himself furnishes the description. I came to a glen at night, Lions I saw and was afraid. I raised my head and prayed to Sin. To the the gods my prayer came., and was gracious to me. On many seal cylinders and on monuments, Gilgamesh is pictured in the act of fighting with or strangling a lion. In the preserved portions of the epic no reference to this contest has been found. We should look for it at this point of the narrative. The following lines contain a reference to weapons,--ax and sword,--and in so far justify the supposition that some contest takes place. But the text is too mutilated to warrant further conjectures. After escaping from the danger occasioned by the lions, Gilgamesh comes to the mountain Mashu, which is described as a place of terrors, the entrance to which is guarded by 'scorpion-men.' He reached the mountain Mashu, Whose exit is daily guarded,. Whose back extends to the dam of heaven, And whose breast reaches to Aralu; Scorpion-men guard its gate, Of terror-inspiring aspect, whose appearance is deadly, Of awful splendor, shattering mountains. At sunrise and sunset they keep guard over the sun. It will be recalled that the earth is pictured by the Babylonians as a mountain. The description of Mashu is dependent upon this conception. The mountain seems to be coextensive with the earth. The dam of heaven is the point near which the sun rises, and if the scorpion-men guard the sun at sunrise and sunset, the mountain must extend across to the gate through which the sun passes at night to dip into the great Apsu. Aralu is situated under the earth, and Mashu, reaching down to Aralu, must be again coextensive with the earth in this direction. The description of Mashu accordingly is a reflex of the cosmological conceptions developed in Babylonia. The scorpion-men pictured on seal cylinders belong to the mythical monsters, half-man, half-beast, with which the world was peopled at the beginning of things. However, there is also an historical background to the description. The name Mashu appears in texts as the Arabian desert to the west and southwest of the Euphrates Valley. It is called a land of dryness, where neither birds nor gazelles nor wild asses are found. Even the bold Assyrian armies hesitated before passing through this region. In the light of the early relationships between Babylonia and Arabia, this reference to Mashu may embody a tradition of some expedition to Southern Arabia. Beyond Mashu lay a great sea,--perhaps the Arabian Sea,--which Gilgamesh is obliged to cross ere he reaches his goal. Gilgamesh is terrified at the sight of these scorpion-men but the latter have received notice of his coming and permit him to pass through the gate. A scorpion-man addresses his wife: 'He who comes to us is of divine appearance.' The wife of the scorpion-man agrees that Gilgamesh is in part divine, but she adds that in part he is human. In further conversation, the scorpion-man announces that it is by express command of the gods that Gilgamesh has come to the mountain. Gilgamesh approaches and tells the scorpion-man of his purpose. The hero, recovering his courage, is not held back by the description that the scorpion-man gives him of the dangers that beset the one who ventures to enter the dreadful district. The gate is opened and the journey begins. He gropes his way for one double hour, With dense darkness enclosing him on all sides. He gropes his way for two double hours, With dense darkness enclosing him on all sides. After traversing a distance of twenty-four hours' march, Gilgamesh beholds a tree of splendid appearance, decorated with precious stones and bearing beautiful fruit. Finally he reaches the sea, where the maiden Sabitum has her palace and throne. Upon seeing the hero, the maiden locks the gates of her palace and will not permit Gilgamesh to pass across the sea. Gilgamesh pleads with Sabitum, tells of the loss of his friend Eabani, 'who has become dust,' and whose fate he does not wish to share. Gilgamesh speaks to Sabitum: ' Sabitum, which is the way to Parnapishtim? If it is possible, let me cross the ocean. If it is not possible, let me stretch myself on the ground.' Sabitum speaks to Gilgamesh: 'O Gilgamesh! there has never been a ferry, And no one has ever crossed the ocean. Shamash, the hero, has crossed it, but except Shamash, who can cross it? Difficult is the passage, very difficult the path. waters of death that are guarded by a bolt. How canst thou, O Gilgamesh, traverse the ocean? And after thou hast crossed the waters of death, what wilt thou do?' Sabitum then tells Gilgamesh that there is one possibility of his accomplishing his task. If Ardi-Ea, the ferryman of Parnapishtim, will take Gilgamesh across, well and good; if not, he must abandon all hope. The ocean, though not expressly called Apsu, is evidently identical with the great body of waters supposed to both surround the earth and to flow beneath it. The reference to 'the waters of death' thus becomes clear. The gathering-place of the dead being under the earth, near to the Apsu, the great 'Okeanos' forms a means of approach to the nether world. It is into this ocean, forming part of the Apsu, that the sun dips at evening and through which it passes during the night. The scene between Gilgamesh and Sabitum accordingly is suggested, in part, by the same cosmological conceptions that condition the description of the mountain Mashu. Sabitum herself is a figure that still awaits satisfactory explanation. She is called the goddess Siduri. The name of this goddess is found as an element in proper names, but of her traits we know nothing. Sabitum appears originally to have been a term descriptive of her, and Hommel may be right in explaining the name as 'the one from Sabu,' and in taking the latter as the name of a district in Arabia. It is tempting to think of the famous Saba in Southern Arabia. Obedient to the advice of Sabitum, Gilgamesh tells Ardi-Ea his story and also his desire. Now Ardi-Ea, which is the way to. If it is possible, let me cross the ocean, And if not possible, let me lie outstretched on the ground. Ardi-Ea consents, and tells Gilgamesh to take his ax, to go into the woods, and to cut down a large pole that may serve as a rudder. Gilgamesh, upon hearing this, Takes an ax in his hand,. Goes to the wood and makes a rudder five gar long. Gilgamesh and Ardi-Ea mount the ship.. The ship tosses from side to side. After a course of one month and fifteen days, on the third day Ardi-Ea reaches the waters of death. This appears to be the most dangerous part of the voyage. Ardi-Ea urges Gilgamesh to cling to the rudder, and counts the strokes he is to take. The waters are not extensive, for only twelve strokes are enumerated; but the current is so strong that it is with the utmost difficulty that Gilgamesh succeeds in passing through them. At last, Gilgamesh is face to face with Parnapishtim. The latter is astonished to see a living person come across the waters. Gilgamesh addresses Parnapishtim from the ship, recounts his deeds, among which we distinguish the killing of a panther, of Alu, of the divine bull, and of Khumbaba. The death of Eabani is also dwelt upon, and then Gilgamesh pleads with Parnapishtim, tells him of the long, difficult way that he has traveled, and of all that he has encountered on the road. Difficult lands I passed through, All seas I crossed. Parnapishtim expresses his sympathy: Gilgamesh has filled his heart with woe, But neither gods nor men. Parnapishtim thereupon addresses Gilgamesh, showing him how impossible it is for any mortal to escape death. The inexorable law will prevail as long as 'houses continue to be built,' as long as 'friendships' and 'hostilities' prevail, as long 'as the waters sea.' The Anunnaki, the great gods, and the goddess Mammitum, the creators of everything Determine death and life. No one knows the days of death. At this point Gilgamesh propounds a most natural question: How comes it, if what Parnapishtim says is true, that the latter is alive, while possessing all the traits of a human being? The eleventh tablet of the epic begins: Gilgamesh speaks to him, to Parnapishtim, the far-removed: 'I gaze at thee in amazement, Parnapishtim. Thy appearance is normal. As I am, so art thou. Thy entire nature is normal. As I am, so art thou. Thou art completely equipped for the fray. hast placed upon thee. Tell me how thou didst come to obtain eternal life among the gods.' In reply, Parnapishtim tells the story of his escape from the common fate of mankind. The story is a long one and has no connection with the career of Gilgamesh. It embodies a recollection of a rain-storm that once visited a city, causing a general destruction, but from which Parnapishtim and his family miraculously escaped. The main purport of the tale is not to emphasize this miracle, but the far greater one that, after having been saved from the catastrophe, Parnapishtim should also have been granted immortal life. The moral, however, is that the exception proves the rule. With this tradition of the destruction of a certain place, there has been combined a nature myth symbolizing the annual overflow of the Euphrates, and the temporary disappearance of all land that this inundation brought about, prior to the elaborate canal system that was developed in the valley. It is the same myth that we have come across in the creation epic and which, as we have seen, was instrumental in moulding the advanced cosmological conceptions of the Babylonians.""","""Gilgamesh's quest for immortality""","2230","""Gilgamesh, the legendary Sumerian king of Uruk, is a central figure in one of the oldest works of literature known to humanity - the """"Epic of Gilgamesh."""" This epic poem recounts Gilgamesh's ambitious quest for immortality, a theme that continues to captivate readers across centuries. The story delves into themes of mortality, friendship, the nature of divinity, and the human desire to defy death. Gilgamesh's relentless pursuit of eternal life offers profound insights into the human condition and the quest for transcendence.  The Epic of Gilgamesh opens with a portrayal of Gilgamesh as a tyrannical ruler, oppressing his people with his arrogance and power. However, the arrival of Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to humble Gilgamesh, transforms the king's character. The two warriors become inseparable friends, embarking on grand adventures together. It is through Enkidu's untimely death that Gilgamesh is forced to confront his own mortality, setting him on a quest for immortality to escape the fate that awaits all humans.  Gilgamesh's journey for eternal life leads him to seek out Utnapishtim, the only survivor of the Great Flood in Sumerian mythology. Utnapishtim was granted immortality by the gods as a reward for his role in preserving life during the cataclysmic flood. To find Utnapishtim, Gilgamesh must undertake a perilous journey through the mountains, crossing vast deserts and treacherous waters. This quest symbolizes humanity's relentless pursuit of the divine and the distant dream of transcending earthly limitations.  Upon reaching Utnapishtim, Gilgamesh learns the harsh truth about immortality. Utnapishtim recounts the story of the Great Flood and explains that immortality is reserved for the gods alone. However, he offers Gilgamesh a chance to prove his worthiness by staying awake for seven days and six nights. But each time Gilgamesh falls asleep, Utnapishtim's wife bakes a loaf of bread, marking the passage of time and exposing Gilgamesh's mortal limitations.  Through this trial, Gilgamesh comes to terms with his mortality and realizes the importance of living a meaningful life rather than seeking an unattainable immortality. Utnapishtim imparts valuable wisdom to Gilgamesh, emphasizing the fleeting nature of human existence and the importance of cherishing the present moment. Gilgamesh's quest for immortality ultimately becomes a quest for wisdom and acceptance of his place in the cosmic order.  The story of Gilgamesh's quest for immortality resonates with readers because it explores universal themes such as the fear of death, the search for purpose, and the importance of human connection. Gilgamesh's transformation from a tyrannical ruler to a humble seeker of wisdom reflects the timeless struggle for personal growth and self-discovery. His friendship with Enkidu highlights the power of companionship in overcoming life's challenges and finding meaning in the face of mortality.  The character of Gilgamesh embodies both the hubris of seeking to defy death and the humility required to accept one's mortality. His quest for immortality serves as a cautionary tale, reminding readers of the inevitability of death and the fleeting nature of human existence. Through Gilgamesh's journey, we are encouraged to contemplate the significance of our actions, the legacy we leave behind, and the profound mysteries of life and death.  In conclusion, Gilgamesh's quest for immortality in the """"Epic of Gilgamesh"""" stands as a timeless exploration of the human condition and the enduring quest for transcendence. Through his trials and tribulations, Gilgamesh grapples with profound questions about mortality, divinity, and the nature of existence. His quest serves as a reminder of the limits of human ambition and the importance of finding meaning in the transient nature of life. The story of Gilgamesh continues to fascinate and inspire readers with its profound insights into the complexities of the human experience and the eternal pursuit of immortality.""","836"
"Ostwald Wilhelm","""Hence, in case of the 'confirmation,' we can only conclude that that portion of the view essential for the instance in question is correct. One readily perceives that these observations find application in all provinces of science and life. There are no absolutely correct assertions, and even the falsest may in some respect be true. There are only greater and lesser probabilities, and every advance made by the human intellect tends to increase the degree of probability of experiential relations, or natural laws. =7. The Classification of the Sciences.= From the preceding observations the means may be drawn for outlining a complete table of the sciences. However, we must not regard it complete in the sense that it gives every possible ramification and turn of each science, but that it sets up a frame inside of which at given points each science finds its place, so that, in the course of progressive enlargement, the frame need not be exceeded. The basic thought upon which this classification rests is that of graded abstraction. We have a concept is all the more general, that is, is applicable to all the more experiences, the fewer parts or elementary concepts it contains. So we shall begin the system of the sciences with the most general concepts, that is, the elementary are known which have been found empirically and the 'deductive' proof of which we have as yet not succeeded in obtaining. The most general concept expressed and operative in these sciences is the concept of order, of conjugacy or function, the content and significance of which will become clear later in a more thorough study of the special sciences. In the second group, the physical sciences, the arbitrariness of the classification becomes very apparent, since these sciences are among the best known. We are perfectly justified in regarding mechanics as a part of physics; and in our day physical chemistry, which in the last twenty years suddenly developed into an extended and important special science, thrust itself between physics and chemistry. The most general concept of the physical sciences is that of energy, which does not appear in the formal sciences. To be sure it is not a fundamental concept. On the contrary, its characteristic is undoubtedly that of compositeness, or, rather, complexity. The third group comprehends all the relations of living beings. Their most general concept, accordingly, is that of life. By physiology is understood the entire science dealing with non-psychic life phenomena. It therefore embraces what is called, in the present often chance arrangement of scientific activities, botany, zoology, and physiology of the plants, animals, and man. Psychology is the science of mental phenomena. As such, it is not limited to man, even though for many reasons he claims by far the preponderating part of it for himself. Sociology is the science which deals with the peculiarities of the human race. It may therefore be called anthropology, but in a far wider sense than the word is now applied. =8. The Applied Sciences.= It will be remarked that the grouping of the table gives no place at all in its scheme to certain branches of learning taught in the universities and equally good technical institutions. We look in vain not only for theology and jurisprudence, but also for astronomy, medicine, etc. The explanation and justification of this is, that for purposes of systematization we must distinguish between pure and applied sciences. By virtue of their strictly conceptual exclusiveness the pure sciences constitute a regular hierarchy or graded series, so that all the concepts that have been used and dealt with in the preceding sciences are repeated in the following sciences, while certain characteristic new concepts enter in addition. Thus logic, the science of the manifold, exercises its dominion over all the other sciences, while the specific concepts of physics and chemistry have nothing to do with it, though they are of importance to all the biologic sciences. Through this graded addition of, the construction of the pure sciences proceeds in strict regularity, and their problems arise exclusively from the application of new concepts to all the earlier ones. In other words, their problems do not reach them accidentally from without, but result from the action and reaction of their concepts upon one another. At the same time there are problems that each day sets before us without regard to system. These come from our endeavor to improve life and avert evil. In the problems of life we are confronted by the whole variety of possible concepts, and under the day's immediate compulsion we cannot wait, if we are sowing crops or helping a sick man, until physiology and all the other appropriate sciences have solved all the problems of plant growth and the changes of the human body and human energy. When other signs fail, we use the position of the stars for finding our way on the high seas. In this manner we turn the teaching of the stars, or astronomy, into an applied science, in which at first mechanics alone seemed to have a part. Later physics took a share in it, then optics took a particularly prominent share, and in recent times not only did chemistry find its way into astronomy, but the specifically biologic concept of evolution was applied in astronomy with success. Thus, side by side with the pure sciences are the applied, which are to be distinguished from the pure sciences by the fact that they do not unfold their problems systematically, but are assigned them by the external circumstances of man's life. The pure sciences, therefore, almost always have a larger or smaller share in the tasks of the applied sciences. For instance, in building a bridge or railroad, physical problems have to be taken into consideration as well as sociologic problems (problems of trade), and a good physician should be a psychologist as well as a chemist. But since all the individual questions arising in the applied sciences may be considered essentially as problems of one or other pure science, they need not be explicitly enumerated along with the pure sciences, especially since their development is greatly dependent upon temporary conditions and is therefore incapable of simple systematization. PART II, THE OF THE, AND =9. The Most General Concept.= If we try to conceive the whole structure of science according to the principle of the increasing complexity of concepts, the first question which confronts us is, What concept is the most general of all possible concepts, so general that it enters into every concept formation and acts as a decisive factor? In order to find this concept let us go back to the psycho-physical basis of concept formation, namely, memory, and let us investigate what is the general characteristic determining memory. We soon perceive that if a being were to lead an absolutely uniform existence, no memories could be evoked. There would be nothing by which the past could be distinguished from the present, hence nothing by which to compare them. So the 'primal phenomenon' of conscious thought is the realization of a difference, a difference between memory and the present, or, to put the same idea still more generally, between two memories. Our experiences, therefore, are divided into two parts, distinguished from each other. In order to predicate something of a perfectly general nature concerning those parts, without regard to their particular content, we must, in accordance with the means employed in human intercourse, designate them by a name.""","""Classification of Sciences and Concepts""","1447","""In the vast landscape of human knowledge, the classification of sciences serves as a guiding framework for organizing the multitude of disciplines that seek to understand and explain the world around us. This systematic arrangement helps us navigate the vast sea of knowledge by grouping related fields of study together based on shared principles, methodologies, and subject matter. By categorizing sciences into various branches and subfields, we are able to appreciate the interconnectedness of different disciplines and grasp the diverse ways in which we explore and make sense of the complexities of our universe.  **Natural Sciences:**  At the core of scientific inquiry lie the natural sciences, which encompass disciplines that examine the physical world and natural phenomena. Physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy are prominent branches of the natural sciences that delve into the fundamental laws governing matter, energy, life, and the universe. Physics, often referred to as the most fundamental science, investigates the behavior of matter and energy in the universe, from subatomic particles to the vast cosmos. Chemistry focuses on the composition, structure, properties, and transformations of matter, exploring the intricacies of atoms and molecules. Biology explores the study of living organisms, their structure, function, growth, evolution, and interactions with the environment. Astronomy, the study of celestial objects and phenomena, unravels the mysteries of the universe beyond our planet.  **Social Sciences:**  In contrast to the natural sciences, the social sciences emphasize the study of human behavior, societies, and institutions. Psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics, political science, and geography are key branches within the social sciences that shed light on the complexities of human societies. Psychology investigates the mind and behavior of individuals, exploring cognitive processes, emotions, personality, and mental health. Sociology delves into the study of human society, social relationships, institutions, and social change. Anthropology examines human culture, evolution, and diversity, studying aspects such as language, kinship, religion, and customs. Economics explores the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, along with the behaviors of individuals and organizations in economic systems. Political science analyzes the functioning of governments, political behavior, public policies, and international relations. Geography studies the Earth's physical features, environments, and spatial relationships, encompassing both physical geography (landforms, climate, ecosystems) and human geography (population, urbanization, settlements).  **Formal Sciences:**  The formal sciences are concerned with abstract concepts and systems of logic and structure. Mathematics and logic are key disciplines within the formal sciences that provide the foundational frameworks for scientific inquiry and reasoning. Mathematics, often considered the language of science, deals with numbers, quantities, shapes, structures, and patterns, providing tools for modeling and solving real-world problems across various disciplines. Logic, on the other hand, is concerned with valid reasoning and arguments, establishing rules of inference and deduction that underpin rational thought and decision-making in both mathematics and philosophy.  **Applied Sciences:**  In addition to the pure sciences, applied sciences focus on the practical application of scientific knowledge in various fields. Engineering, medicine, technology, and environmental science are prominent branches of the applied sciences that bridge the gap between theory and real-world solutions. Engineering applies principles from mathematics and science to design and create structures, machines, systems, and processes to address societal needs. Medicine combines biological, chemical, and physical sciences to diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases and promote human health. Technology harnesses scientific knowledge to develop tools, devices, and systems that improve efficiency and quality of life. Environmental science integrates knowledge from various disciplines to study the environment, natural resources, pollution, climate change, and sustainability, aiming to protect and preserve the planet for future generations.  **Interdisciplinary Sciences:**  As scientific inquiries become increasingly complex and interconnected, interdisciplinary sciences have emerged to bridge traditional disciplinary boundaries and foster collaborative research approaches. For instance, bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, and information technology to analyze biological data and solve biological problems. Similarly, neuroscience integrates biology, psychology, and physics to study the brain and nervous system and understand cognitive functions and behaviors. Environmental economics merges economics and environmental science to analyze how economic activities impact the environment and develop sustainable policies. Interdisciplinary studies offer a holistic perspective and innovative solutions to multifaceted challenges that cannot be effectively addressed within the confines of a single discipline.  In conclusion, the classification of sciences provides us with a structured framework to explore the diverse realms of knowledge and understand the world from different perspectives. By categorizing sciences into distinct branches and subfields, we gain insight into the underlying principles, methodologies, and relationships that define each discipline. Whether through the natural sciences investigating the physical universe, the social sciences unraveling human behaviors and societies, the formal sciences establishing logical frameworks, the applied sciences addressing real-world problems, or the interdisciplinary sciences fostering collaboration across disciplines, the classification of sciences enriches our understanding of the complexities of our world and enables us to make meaningful contributions to society through scientific inquiry and discovery.""","988"
"Vaknin Samuel 1961 ","""'The term 'narcissism' tends to be employed diagnostically by those proclaiming loyalty to the drive model and mixed model theorists, who are interested in preserving a tie to drive theory. 'Schizoid' tends to be employed diagnostically by adherents of relational models, who are interested in articulating their break with drive theory. These two differing diagnoses and accompanying formulations are applied to patients who are essentially similar, by theorists who start with very different conceptual premises and ideological affiliations.' (Greenberg and Mitchell. Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory. Harvard University Press, 983) Klein, in effect, said that relational flows. A drive is the mode of relationship between an individual and his internal objects - the very definition of schizoid phenomena. This is why narcissists feel empty, fragmented, 'unreal' (movie-like) and diffuse. It is because their Ego is still because they withdrew from the with these parental images. Fairbairn's work - even more than Kernberg's, not to mention Kohut's - integrates all these insights into a coherent framework. Guntrip elaborated on it and together they created one of the most impressive theoretical bodies in the history of psychology. Fairbairn internalised Klein's insights that drives are object-orientated and their goal is the formation of relationships and not primarily the attainment of pleasure. Pleasurable sensations are the means to achieve relationships. The Ego does not seek to be stimulated and pleased but to find the right, 'good', supporting object. The infant is fused with his Primary Object, the mother. Life is not about using objects for pleasure under the supervision of the Ego and Superego, as Freud postulated. Life is about separating, differentiating, achieving independence from the Primary Object and the initial state of fusion with it. Dependence on internal objects is narcissism. Freud's post- of life can be either mature. The newborn's Ego is looking for objects with which to form relationships. Inevitably, some of these objects and some of these relationships frustrate the infant and disappoint him. He compensates for these setbacks by creating compensatory internal objects. The initially unitary Ego thus fragments into a growing group of internal objects. Reality breaks our hearts and minds, according to Fairbairn. The Ego and its objects are 'twinned' and the Ego is split in three. A schizoid state ensues. The 'original' (Freudian or libidinal) Ego is unitary, instinctual, needy and object seeking. It then fragments as a result of the three typical interactions with the the Ego? To achieve a successful transition from internal objects to external ones - the child needs the right portions of his Ego. Thus, his parents become PART of the less crucial. Fairbairn and Guntrip think that if a person is too attached to his compensatory internal objects - he finds it hard to mature psychologically. Maturing is about letting go of internal objects. Some people just don't want to mature, or are reluctant to do so, or are ambivalent about it. This reluctance, this withdrawal to an internal world of representations, internal objects and broken Ego - is narcissism itself. Narcissists simply don't know how to be themselves, how to acquire independence and, simultaneously manage their relationships with other people. Both Otto Kernberg and Franz Kohut agreed that narcissism is between neurosis and psychosis. Kernberg thought that it was a borderline phenomenon, on the verge of Kernberg maintains that the narcissistic self is pathological from its very inception. Kohut believes that the narcissist's parents provided him with no assurances that he does possess a a contradiction in terms, an oxymoron. He observes that narcissists are already grandiose and an early halt the emergence of the paranoid-schizoid position described by Klein. In an adult such an emergence is known as 'psychosis' and this is why Kernberg classifies narcissists as. Even Kohut, who is an opponent of Kernberg's classification, uses Eugene O'Neill's famous sentence: 'Man is born broken. He lives by mending. The grace of God is glue.' Kernberg himself sees a clear connection between schizoid narcissistic phenomena (inability to form relationships or to make commitments or to empathise). C. Fred Alford in 'Narcissism: Socrates, the Frankfurt School and Psychoanalytic Theory' wrote: 'Fairbairn and Guntrip represent the purest expression of object relations theory, which is characterised by the insight that real relationships with real people build psychic structure. Although they rarely mention narcissism, they see a schizoid split in the self as characteristic of virtually all-emotional disorder. It is Greenberg and Mitchell, in Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory who establish the relevance of Fairbairn and Guntrip. by pointing out that what American analysts label 'narcissism', British analysts tend to call 'Schizoid Personality Disorder'. This insight allows us to connect the symptomatology of narcissism - feelings of emptiness, unreality, alienation and emotional withdrawal - with a theory that sees such symptoms as an accurate reflection of the experience of being split-off from a part of oneself. That narcissism is such a confusing category is in large part because its drive-theoretic definition, the libidinal cathexis of the self - in a word, self-love - seems far removed from the experience of narcissism, as characterised by a loss of, or split-in, the self. Fairbairn's and Guntrip's view of narcissism as an excessive attachment of the Ego to internal objects (roughly analogous to Freud's narcissistic, as opposed to object, love), resulting in various splits in the Ego necessary to maintain these attachments, allows us to penetrate this confusion.' Serial Killers By: Dr. Sam Vaknin Countess Erszebet Bathory was a breathtakingly beautiful, unusually well-educated woman, married to a descendant of Vlad Dracula of Bram Stoker fame. In 611, she was tried - though, being a noblewoman, not convicted - in Hungary for slaughtering 12 young girls. The true figure may have been 0-00, though the Countess recorded in her diary more than 10 girls and 0 bodies were found in her estate when it was raided. The Countess was notorious as an inhuman sadist long before her hygienic fixation. She once ordered the mouth of a talkative servant sewn. It is rumoured that in her childhood she witnessed a gypsy being sewn into a horse's stomach and left to die. The girls were not killed outright.""","""Narcissism and Psychoanalytic Theory""","1386","""Narcissism, a term derived from the Greek myth of Narcissus, has found its way into the realm of psychoanalytic theory as a complex and multifaceted concept. In the context of psychology, narcissism refers to a personality trait characterized by an excessive sense of self-importance, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. Sigmund Freud, the pioneering figure in psychoanalysis, was one of the first to explore narcissism in his theoretical framework, shedding light on how it manifests and its impact on an individual's psyche.  Freud's conceptualization of narcissism evolved over time. Initially, he discussed primary narcissism, a developmental stage in which infants are self-absorbed and focused on gratifying their own needs. According to Freud, this narcissistic phase is a normal part of early development and lays the foundation for later social and emotional growth. However, Freud later extended his theory to include secondary narcissism, which he described as a pathological form of narcissism characterized by an excessive investment in one's self-image and an inability to form healthy relationships with others.  Freud's work on narcissism laid the groundwork for subsequent theorists, including Heinz Kohut and Otto Kernberg, to further explore this phenomenon within the context of psychoanalytic theory. Kohut, a prominent figure in the field of self psychology, viewed narcissism as a developmentally necessary stage that, when disrupted, could result in pathological narcissism. He emphasized the importance of mirroring and empathic responses in childhood for the healthy development of the self and the regulation of narcissistic tendencies.  Kernberg, on the other hand, focused on narcissistic pathology within the context of object relations theory. He identified malignant narcissism, a severe form of narcissistic personality disorder characterized by grandiosity, lack of empathy, and a pervasive pattern of exploiting others. Kernberg highlighted the role of early childhood experiences, particularly disturbances in object relations, in the development of narcissistic pathology.  From a psychoanalytic perspective, narcissism is not solely viewed as a negative trait but rather as a complex psychological phenomenon with both adaptive and maladaptive aspects. Adaptive narcissism can manifest as healthy self-esteem, self-confidence, and the ability to assert one's needs and desires. In contrast, maladaptive narcissism can lead to a distorted self-image, difficulties in forming intimate relationships, and challenges in regulating self-esteem.  The clinical implications of narcissism within psychoanalytic theory are profound. Therapists working with individuals exhibiting narcissistic traits must navigate a delicate balance between acknowledging and validating their patients' sense of self while also challenging and exploring the underlying vulnerabilities and insecurities driving their behavior. The therapeutic process often involves exploring early attachment experiences, working through feelings of shame and inadequacy, and fostering a more balanced sense of self-worth.  Psychoanalytic interventions for narcissistic individuals may include techniques aimed at enhancing self-reflection, promoting emotional awareness, and fostering empathy towards others. Through the therapeutic relationship, individuals with narcissistic traits can begin to develop a more nuanced understanding of themselves and their interactions with the world. By exploring the underlying emotional conflicts and unconscious dynamics fueling their narcissistic defenses, patients can gradually move towards a more integrated sense of self and healthier relationships with others.  In conclusion, narcissism occupies a significant place within psychoanalytic theory, offering a rich and nuanced understanding of human personality and development. By delving into the complexities of narcissism from both adaptive and maladaptive perspectives, psychoanalytic theorists have provided valuable insights into the intricacies of the human psyche. Through further research and clinical practice, the field of psychoanalysis continues to deepen its understanding of narcissism and its implications for individual functioning and emotional well-being.""","751"
"Martineau James","""To look for such organic indications in the sparse productions of the Apostle's pen, is to ask too much from a few incidental letters, bearing to his whole life the proportion of a dozen pages of random excerpts to a cyclopdia. If only the matters treated be different, the whole group of writings may very well express, in its several parts and aspects, one simultaneous state of mind. If the types of thought be such as could scarcely co-exist, the cause may be sought as reasonably in a plurality of authors as in a succession of beliefs in the same author; and only a most delicate combination of symptoms can rescue the problem from this indeterminate state of double solution. Nor ought we to forget, in weighing the probabilities, that the whole set of Epistles comprising the phenomena of difference were written within nine years; and that, ere the first of them was produced, St. Paul had been a convert fifteen years, and had reached the age of fifty. The earlier and longer of these periods is a more natural seat of mental change than the later and shorter; especially of a change not apparent so much in particular judgments and opinions, as in the whole complexion of spiritual feeling and idea. But, we are assured, the Apostle directly testifies to his own progress in doctrine; and there was a time when he had 'known Christ according to the flesh,'--had preached him 'in a more Jewish and less spiritual manner,'--though 'henceforth he would know him so no more.' Mr. Stanley, explaining this much-disputed phrase, says:-- 'Probably, he must be here alluding to those who laid stress on their having seen Christ in Palestine, or on their connection with him or with 'the brothers of the Lord' by actual descent; and if so, they were probably of the party 'of Christ.' But the words lead us to infer that something of this kind had once been his own state of mind, not only in the time before his remarkable confession of former weakness and error, and of conscious progress in religious knowledge.'--Vol. II. p. 06. Did St. Paul then ever 'lay stress on having seen Christ in Palestine'? or on actual blood-connection with him? or on 'something of this kind'? To personal relations with Jesus in his ministry or family he had no pretensions; and the spirit with which he had always treated everything 'of this kind,' is so apparent from his narrative to the Galatians as to contradict Mr. Stanley's inference. Mr. Jowett gives the phrase a different turn. Apostle charged with at one time 'preaching circumcision,' he accepts this as synonymous with 'knowing Christ according to the flesh' (i. 2). This, however, would imply that he was originally no 'Apostle to the Gentiles,' but insisted on mediate conversion into the Gospel through the law. Feeling the irreconcilable variance of such an hypothesis with the autobiographical notices in the Epistles, Mr. Jowett lowers his phraseology, and attributes to St. Paul's early teaching only such sentiments as 'might be thought' to make him 'a preacher of the circumcision.' And so we lose ourselves again in 'something of the kind.' Yet at last, in the following passage, we find the critic's finger distinctly laid on the doctrine which he proposes to identify with the Apostle's 'knowing Christ according to the flesh.' 'That such a change' (in the Apostle's teaching) 'is capable of being traced, has been already intimated. Both Epistles to the Thessalonians, with the exception of a few practical precepts, are the expansion and repetition of a single thought,--'the coming of Christ.' It was the absorbing thought of the Apostle and his converts, quickened in both by the persecutions which they had suffered. Not that with this expectation of Christ's kingdom there mingled any vision of a temporal rule over the kingdoms of the earth. That was far from the Apostle. But there was that in it which fell short of the more perfect truth. It was not, 'The kingdom of God is within you'; but, 'Lo here, and lo there.' It was defined by time, and was to take place within the Apostle's own life. The images in which it clothed itself were traditional among the Jews; they were outward and visible, liable to the misconstruction of the enemies of the faith, and to the misapprehension of the first converts,--imperfectly, as the Apostle saw afterwards, conveying the inward and spiritual meaning. The kingdom which they described was not eternal and heavenly, but very near and present, ready to burst forth everywhere, and by its very nearness in point of time seeming to touch our actual human state. Afterwards the kingdom of God appeared to remove itself within, to withdraw into the unseen world. The earthen vessel must be broken first, the unbeliever unclothed that he might be clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up of life. He was no longer 'waiting for the Son from heaven'; but 'desirous to depart and be with Christ' (Phil. i. 3). Such is the change, not so much in the Apostle's belief as in his mode of conception; a change natural to the human mind itself, and above all to the Jewish mind; a change which, after it had taken place, left the vestiges of the prior state in the Montanism of the second century, which may not improperly be regarded as the spirit of the first century overliving itself. Old things had passed away, and, behold, all things became new. And yet the former things--the material vision of Christ's kingdom--have ever been prone to return; not only in the first and second century, but in every age of enthusiasm, men have been apt to walk by sight and not by faith. In the hour of trouble and perplexity, when darkness spreads itself over the earth, and Antichrist is already come, they have lifted up their eyes to the heavens, looking for the sign of the Son of man.'--Vol. I. p. 0. If to announce the coming of Christ is to 'know him according to the flesh,' St. Paul assuredly did not keep his resolve 'henceforth to know him no more.' For the expectation reappears, without any perceptible change, in his later Epistles; as in Rom. xiii. 1, 2: 'Do this the rather, knowing the time,--that now is the time to awake out of sleep: for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed: the night is far spent; the day is at hand';--and in Phil. iv.: 'The Lord is at hand.' Moreover, it is utterly impossible that this element of his teaching could be adduced in proof of his 'preaching circumcision.' It had nothing to do with the question of Jew and Gentile; with the most opposite solutions of which it is equally compatible. In truth, our author has here combined two passages, which throw no light on one another, and has extracted from each what neither is able to yield. The undoubtedly refer to a former state of the writer's own mind, when he 'recognized Christ according to the flesh.' But he alludes, we apprehend, to the period when he was a 'Hebrew of the Hebrews'; and had no conception as yet of a suffering, dying, and heavenly Christ;--when he was full of the thoughts still occupying the twelve, who did not take in the significance of the cross, but carried past it their old Messianic notions. 'There may have been a time,' he means to say, 'when I thought only of a national, Israelitish, historical Messiah, bound by the law of his fathers, and binding to it. Had this been the true conception of him, then would it have been a matter of privilege and pride to be near his person, to stand in natural relations with him, and be mixed up with the incidents of his local career. But ever since I understood the cross, and saw that Messiah's life began in death, a far other truth has dawned upon me. When he gave up the ghost, all the accidents of his humanity--his lineage, his nationality, his earthly manifestation--were left behind and died away; and they must carry with them into extinction whatever feelings had collected round them,--family pride, Jewish exclusiveness, and the memories of personal companionship. From that moment, clear of earthly entanglements, Christ in the spirit draws to him a community of human spirits,--one with him in self-abnegation, dying to the earthly past; one with him in re-birth, living to heavenly union with God. Thus, if any one be in Christ, it amounts to a new creation; his old self has passed away; behold, all things have become new.' The Apostle, therefore, sets up the death of Christ, as cutting off, for all disciples, the prior time from the subsequent; as flinging the former, with all the human conceptions that cling to it, into eclipse and annihilation, and beginning a new and luminous existence in the latter; as breaking the very identity of the believer, and delivering him from the thraldom of nature into the freedom of the Spirit. The cross had already done its work ere St. Paul became a disciple.""","""St. Paul's Evolution of Doctrine""","1936","""St. Paul, the influential figure in early Christianity, played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of Christian doctrine. His teachings and letters not only contributed to the establishment of the Christian faith but also influenced the theological developments that followed. As a Pharisee who converted to Christianity after a dramatic encounter with the risen Jesus on the road to Damascus, St. Paul brought a unique perspective and fervor to his mission of spreading the gospel message.  One of the key aspects of St. Paul's evolution of doctrine was his emphasis on the universality of the Christian message. He ardently believed that Jesus' death and resurrection were not just for a select group of people but for all humanity. This inclusive approach to salvation went against the prevailing Jewish belief at the time, which often viewed God's favor as primarily reserved for the chosen people. St. Paul's teachings, as outlined in his letters to various communities, consistently emphasized that salvation was available to both Jews and Gentiles alike.  Furthermore, St. Paul played a significant role in clarifying and expanding on foundational Christian beliefs, such as the nature of sin, justification, and the role of faith in salvation. In his letter to the Romans, for example, he delved into the concept of justification by faith, arguing that individuals are made right with God through their faith in Jesus Christ rather than through observance of the Mosaic Law. This radical redefinition of righteousness helped to shape the theological understanding of salvation in early Christianity and laid the groundwork for future discussions on the relationship between faith and works.  St. Paul's emphasis on the role of grace in salvation also had a profound impact on Christian doctrine. He emphasized that salvation was a gift from God that could not be earned through human efforts. This emphasis on grace as a central component of salvation distinguished early Christian thought from prevailing philosophies and religions of the time. By highlighting the unmerited nature of God's favor, St. Paul underscored the transformative power of grace in the lives of believers and set the stage for later theological developments on the subject.  Additionally, St. Paul's teachings on the unity of the body of Christ and the diversity of spiritual gifts within the Christian community contributed to the evolving understanding of the Church as a dynamic and inclusive entity. He wrote extensively about the interconnectedness of believers as members of one body, each with unique roles and functions to play. This emphasis on unity amid diversity laid the groundwork for the development of ecclesiology and the recognition of the Church as a diverse yet unified community of believers.  St. Paul's evolution of doctrine was not without controversy or challenges. His teachings sometimes sparked debates and disagreements within the early Christian communities, particularly regarding the inclusion of Gentiles in the faith and the relationship between faith and works. These debates led to important theological discussions and councils that helped to clarify and solidify key doctrines of the Christian faith.  In conclusion, St. Paul's evolution of doctrine was marked by his unwavering commitment to spreading the message of Christ to all people, regardless of their background or status. His teachings on salvation, grace, and the unity of believers continue to influence Christian theology and practice to this day. Through his letters and missionary journeys, St. Paul left a lasting legacy that shaped the early development of Christian doctrine and laid the foundation for centuries of theological reflection and exploration.""","666"
"Boddy Evan Marlett  1934","""The properties of salt are not subject to the slightest change or modification: the acid is the hydrochloric or muriatic, the base sodium, and the combination, the chloride of sodium. We find salt, or the chloride of sodium, in sea-water, the amount averaging from to per cent., so that we see it is present in no inconsiderable quantity; it is more or less impure from other salts being held in solution in conjunction: where it comes from no suggestion has yet been broached. We know that it is present, and we also know that it can be obtained by adopting certain measures for extracting it; and we are aware, from recent investigations, that the colour and density of the sea is dependent on the quantity held in solution. This is all we really know regarding the presence of the chloride of sodium in the ocean. The salt which we obtain from brine-springs contains the same constituents as that which we extract from the sea, though in their course upwards they collect on their way soluble salts, and therefore the water goes through certain modifications, which the reader doubtless recollects. For instance, the brine-springs of Lancashire and Worcestershire rise up through strata of sandstone and red marl, which contain large beds of rock-salt. The origin of the brine, therefore, may be derived from beds of fossil-salt; but as the muriate of soda is one of the products in volcanic regions, the original source of salt may be as deep as that of lava. We have also seen that the base of all mineral waters is the chloride of sodium, and that their ingredients are collected and dissolved as they ascend to the surface; therefore they may probably both have the same origin as the sea, as regards the chloride of sodium, which they both hold in solution. We can account for their other characteristics by the wide expansiveness of the sea, which is perpetually absorbing and emitting vapours, and by the several strata through which the mineral waters pass. There may be, though there is nothing that we can advance as corroborative, a subterranean communication existing between them, which would imply a common origin, the differences arising from the physical surroundings, atmospheric influences, and the absorption of soluble salts from the several strata. What is the origin of salt lakes and salt marshes? This is, to a certain extent, more easily explained. One theory as to the origin of salt the overflow and subsequent retirement of the sea-water, their sites having been originally the bed of the ocean when it receded to its present limits, leaving in its course depressions of land, volumes of water of various depths, elevations, and extent of surface, according to their deepness, altitude, or angles of declivity. Other ingenious hypotheses have been broached, which, I need hardly say, are not worth considering, as they are entirely visionary. In the case of isolated salt lakes, the above theory is not applicable; and geologists tell us that they are doubtless the result of volcanic agency, but at what period of time it is impossible to estimate, for the density of the water found in them is not equable, and neither is their specific gravity the same as that of sea-water, nor are there any remains of marine organisms; and as their depth is variable, they are not confined to any particular strata. I have hinted previously that these isolated salt lakes abortions. Had the power which forced them into their present situation been accompanied by that agency which has raised such huge masses as those near Cordova, in Spain, and by the Dead Sea, and which probably brought about their present crystalline form, others by reason of some unexplainable and gradual transition, by chemical means, or decrease of temperature, which naturally would occur the nearer it approached the earths surface, these lakes might have developed into beds or mountains of salt. The salt which is dug out of the earth, and that which is excavated out of isolated salt-mountains, are alike in every respect, and are much more probably the result of volcanic explosion than of the deposition of salt from sea-water, accruing from evaporation while pent up in confined spaces. It may have been, though incalculable ages ago, deposited from the sea, and then in course of time forced up while in a state of fusion by some internal disruption. We thus see that the six conditions under which we find the chloride of sodium more or less indicate a common origin from sea-water, notwithstanding the absence of marine organisms. If we take salt as a whole, leaving out of the question altogether the different conditions in which it is found, and with no reference at all to its existing either in the earth, above the earth, in lakes, or in the sea, but looking at it simply as it is, a mass of rock, or a volume of water holding it in solution, it inclines one to the belief that it possesses a dual inchoation, though the original source of both may have been connate; but owing to extraneous causes which were brought to bear, one branch became crystallised rock-salt, while the other, through immaturity, remains in a state of solution. One is rock-salt, which has been heaved up by volcanic power, and the other is what is known as sea-water; the former has produced the mines, and the solitary mountains, and the Indian Salt Range, and that salt which generates mineral waters, and, it may be, those saline lakes like that which exists between Bombay and Nagpur. According to Sir Charles Lyell, sea-water has access to volcanic foci. He says: Although the theory which assumes that water plays a principal part in volcanic operations does not necessarily imply the proximity of volcanic vents to the ocean, it seems still to follow naturally that the superficial outbursts of steam and lava will be most prevalent where there is an incumbent body of salt water, or any regions rather than in the interior of a continent, where the quantity of rain-water is reduced to a minimum. The experiments of the most eminent chemists have gradually removed, one after another, the objections which were first offered to the doctrine that the salt water of the sea plays a leading part in most volcanic eruptions. Sir Humphry Davy observed that the fumes which escaped from Vesuvian lava deposited common salt. All the principal volcanoes are situated close to the sea, and therefore the hypothesis that a communication exists between them is practically certain; their proximity to the sea, and the deposition of salt from the fumes of lava, as Sir Humphry Davy noticed, are two strong facts. But for all that, it does not prove satisfactorily that salt is solely the result of volcanic agency, and indirectly from the sea, because there is not the slightest trace of the remains of marine organisms, unless they are totally destroyed and obliterated when it is in a state of fusion; if so, it is more conclusive that salt such as we find it is solely due to volcanic force. Salt may have been in times past, as the observations of Sir Humphry Davy seem to corroborate, and as confirmed by more recent chemists, deposited by volcanic agency in the same way that salt is deposited by fumes of hydrochloric acid, which are emitted with the lava during eruptions of such volcanoes as Vesuvius and Etna, by reason of some communication with the sea. As hydrochloric acid is found in the vapours which are disengaged from red-hot lava, and as magnesia, which is not volatile, is left in the lava itself, constituting one of its most important elements, it would certainly lead one to surmise that there is a communication which, though not always in existence, may be periodically caused by the action of the volcano. Both MM. St. Claire Deville and Fouque have succeeded in demonstrating the perfect accordance of the chemical composition of the products of volcanic eruptions, both gaseous and solid, with the doctrine that salt water has been largely present in volcanic foci. If so, why are there no salts of magnesia in volcanic fumeroles? These salts are readily decomposable by hot steam, and when water and heat are present they produce hydrochloric acid and magnesia. M. Fouque affirmed that he witnessed an eruption of Mount Etna in 865/8; the gaseous emanations agreed in kind with those which we might have looked for if large volumes of sea-water had gained access to reservoirs of subterranean lava, and if they had been decomposed and expelled with the lava. We have obtained three facts, viz., that communications probably exist between volcanic foci and sea-water; that fumes of hydrochloric acid which accompany the lava deposit common salt; and that the salts of magnesia are decomposed by heat; and what more probable than that all living organisms which pass with the sea-water are utterly obliterated? By the preceding observations, the reader will see that salt is not subject to geological laws, by reason of its being confined to no particular strata, and by the absence of organic remains; and that it is not derived from sea-water, because there are no marine organisms to be found in it. That though it may have a pristine source, it dual inchoation by its being found as rock-salt, and by its being present in sea-water, and, as I have stated, in a condition of immaturity.""","""Origin and properties of salt""","1940","""Salt is a fundamental ingredient that has shaped human history and culture for millennia. Its origin can be traced back to ancient times when it was valued for its ability to preserve food, enhance flavor, and play vital roles in religious rituals and trade. This article will delve into the origin, properties, and significance of salt throughout history and in our daily lives today.  ### Origin of Salt  Salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), occurs naturally in various forms around the world. The most common sources of salt include sea water, salt lakes, and rock salt deposits. One of the main ways salt is formed is through the evaporation of seawater. When water evaporates, it leaves behind salt crystals, which can be harvested and processed for use.  Rock salt, also known as halite, is another significant source of salt. It is formed through the evaporation of ancient bodies of water that have since dried up, leaving behind deposits of salt. These deposits are then mined and refined for consumption and various industrial uses.  ### Properties of Salt  Salt possesses a multitude of properties that make it essential for numerous applications. Here are some of the key properties of salt:  1. **Flavoring**: Salt is renowned for its ability to enhance the flavor of food. It acts as a flavor enhancer by suppressing bitterness and bringing out the natural flavors of dishes.  2. **Preservation**: One of salt's most ancient uses is as a preservative. Its ability to draw out moisture from food inhibits the growth of bacteria, molds, and yeasts, thus preventing food spoilage.  3. **Seasoning**: Salt is a versatile seasoning agent that adds depth and complexity to dishes. It is used in both savory and sweet recipes to balance flavors and elevate taste profiles.  4. **Chemical Properties**: Salt is a compound composed of sodium and chloride ions. It is essential for various biological functions in the human body, such as maintaining proper fluid balance and nerve function.  5. **Solubility**: Salt is highly soluble in water, making it easy to incorporate into liquid-based recipes. This property allows salt to dissolve evenly, distributing its flavor throughout the dish.  6. **Physical Properties**: Salt crystals are cubic in shape and can vary in size depending on the method of production. The texture of salt can affect how it interacts with food and how it is perceived on the palate.  ### Significance of Salt in History and Culture  Throughout history, salt has played a crucial role in shaping civilizations and cultures around the world. Here are some ways in which salt has been significant:  1. **Economic Importance**: Salt was once a highly prized commodity, often referred to as """"white gold."""" Its scarcity in certain regions led to the development of extensive trade routes and the establishment of salt mines.  2. **Culinary Traditions**: Salt has been an integral part of culinary traditions across cultures. From curing meats to seasoning vegetables, salt is a cornerstone of cooking practices worldwide.  3. **Symbolism and Rituals**: Salt has held symbolic significance in various religions and cultural practices. In many societies, salt is associated with purity, preservation, and hospitality.  4. **Health and Wellness**: Salt has been used for its therapeutic properties in traditional medicine. Salt baths, salt inhalation therapies, and salt lamps are believed to promote relaxation, respiratory health, and overall well-being.  ### Types of Salt  There are numerous types of salt available, each with its own unique characteristics and uses. Some common types of salt include:  1. **Table Salt**: This is the most common type of salt found in households. It is finely ground and often contains additives like iodine to prevent iodine deficiency.  2. **Sea Salt**: Sea salt is harvested through the evaporation of sea water. It contains minerals and trace elements that give it a distinct flavor profile.  3. **Kosher Salt**: Kosher salt has a larger grain size than table salt and is often used in cooking and for koshering meats. Its coarse texture makes it easier to handle and control in recipes.  4. **Himalayan Pink Salt**: Mined from the salt mines in the Himalayan region, this salt is prized for its pink hue and trace mineral content. It is used both in cooking and as a finishing salt.  5. **Flaky Salt**: Flaky salt has a delicate, flaky texture that can enhance the presentation of dishes. It is often used as a finishing salt to add a final touch of flavor and texture.  ### Modern Uses of Salt  In contemporary times, salt continues to be a staple in the culinary world and beyond. Here are some modern uses of salt:  1. **Food Preservation**: Salt is still widely used to preserve foods such as meats, fish, and vegetables. Techniques like curing and brining rely on salt to extend the shelf life of perishable items.  2. **Seasoning and Flavoring**: Salt remains a fundamental seasoning in cooking, used to enhance the taste of dishes and balance flavors. Chefs often experiment with different types of salt to elevate their recipes.  3. **Industrial Applications**: Salt has various industrial applications, such as in water softening, chemical production, and manufacturing processes. Its properties make it a versatile ingredient in many industries.  4. **Health and Beauty**: Salt is incorporated into health and beauty products for its exfoliating and moisturizing properties. Salt scrubs, bath salts, and salt therapy treatments are popular for their rejuvenating effects.  ### Conclusion  In conclusion, salt is a multifaceted substance that has left an indelible mark on human civilization. From its origins in ancient seas to its diverse properties and modern-day applications, salt continues to be a vital component of our lives. Its role in food preservation, culinary arts, cultural traditions, and health and wellness makes it a truly indispensable substance. By understanding the origin, properties, and significance of salt, we can appreciate its value and versatility in both historical contexts and contemporary settings.""","1202"

Mange in horses may be caused by either psoroptic or sarcoptic mites. Psoroptes communis var. equi seems to be the more common parasite. The itching is intense. The inflamed areas are small at first and scattered over the regions of the rump, back and neck . After a time the small areas come together and form large patches, and further spreading of the inflammation results from grooming, scratching and biting the skin. Scattered, elevated eruptions on the skin from which the hair has dropped out are first noticed. These parts may show yellowish scabs. Later the skin is thickened, smooth, wrinkled, cracked, or covered with sores. Scrapings made from the inflamed areas of the skin may show the psoroptic mites. Mange in hogs is comparatively rare. It is caused by one of the sarcoptic mites. The thin portions of the skin are usually first invaded. There are violent itching and rubbing, and small, red elevations occur on the skin in the region of the ears, eyelids or inner surface of the thighs, depending on the part first invaded. The skin becomes greatly thickened and covered with crusts and scabs. Pus formation and ulceration may occur. OF SCAB AND.--A careful inspection of recently purchased animals that pass through stockyards, or are shipped from sections where scab and mange are common skin diseases, is an important preventive measure. Infected animals should be completely isolated from the herd, and kept apart from other animals until after they have been treated. Hogs that are slightly infected should be quarantined and treated. If badly affected, they should be killed, and the carcass disposed of by burning or burying. The different remedies used in the treatment of the disease may be applied by dipping, hand dressing or washing, pouring, smearing and spotting. The first method is the most satisfactory. The last method may be used when a small area of the skin is involved, and during the cold weather. Washing or dipping the animal with a two per cent water solution of liquor cresolis compositus is an effective remedy for the psoroptic forms of scab and mange. Tobacco, lime and sulfur, and arsenical dips are recommended in the treatment of sheep and cattle. Ointments are recommended for animals that are slightly affected with mange. Lime and sulfur dips are recommended by the Bureau of Animal Industry. Small infected areas of the skin may be treated by applying sulfur-iodide ointment. The following ointment is commonly recommended: potassium sulfide ten parts, potassium carbonate two parts, and lard three hundred parts. Sheep cannot be safely dipped for scab during the cold weather. If thickened and scabby, the skin should be scrubbed with the dip, or the animal prepared for dipping or washing by first clipping the hair or wool and scrubbing the skin with water and a good soap. In order to prevent reinfection, it is necessary to remove the animal to new quarters, or thoroughly clean and disinfect the old. It is necessary to wash or spray the fences, floors, walls, brushes and curry-combs with a disinfecting solution. Manure and other litter should be removed to a place where there is no danger from its distributing the infection. OF BY.--Mites or acarina that cause diseases of poultry may live on the feathers, beneath the skin, and within the body of the fowl. The small, red on the surface of the body only when feeding, and spends the rest of the time under collections of filth and in cracks in the roosts and walls of the house. This parasite causes the birds to become restless, emaciated and droopy. A very small the cause of scaly leg. It lives under the skin. The joints of the feet appear affected, and the foot and leg become enlarged, roughened and scaly. Depluming scabies is caused by Sarcoptes laevis var. gallinae. This mite causes the feathers to break off at the surface of the skin. Masses of epidermic scales may form around the broken ends of the feathers. The diagnosis can be confirmed by examining the skin lesions and finding the mite. The air sac cause sufficient irritation to the mucous membrane lining the air sacs to seriously obstruct the air passages with mucus, or produce death from exhaustion. A post-mortem examination of a fowl that has died of this disease shows the mites on the surface of the lining membrane of the air-sacs. They appear as a white or yellow dust. OF BY.--Diseases of poultry caused by mites may be prevented by quarantining all recently purchased birds for a period of from two to four weeks, and by keeping the poultry houses clean. Birds that are found infested with parasites should be destroyed or returned. In case the bird is valuable and suffering from external parasites only, it should be given the necessary treatment. Red mites may be destroyed by thoroughly cleaning the poultry house, and spraying the roosts, nests, walls and floor with a three per cent water solution of liquor cresolis compositus. This should be repeated twice a week for two weeks. Scaly-leg may be treated by applying a penetrating oil to the feet and lower part of the leg. It is advisable to first remove the scales by scrubbing the part with soap and warm water. Dipping the feet in a mixture of kerosene one part and linseed oil two parts is recommended. This should be repeated as often as necessary.. Describe the different bot-flies.. Give the life history of the bot-fly of the horse; of the ox; of sheep.. Give the symptoms of bot-fly diseases.. Give the symptoms of lousiness.. Give treatment for lousiness of different farm animals.. What is the damage from the sheep-tick? Give treatment.. Describe the injury from scabies and mange.. Give treatments for these diseases.. Mention the several poultry mites and tell how to treat them. XXV The common parasitic diseases of domestic animals are caused by the following groups of worms: Flukes or trematoides; tapeworms or Cestoides; thorn-headed worms or Acanthocephales; and round-worms or Nematoids. Flat worms, such as tapeworms and flukes, require secondary hosts. The immature and mature forms of tapeworms are parasites of vertebrate animals, but an invertebrate host is necessary for the completion of the life cycle of the fluke. The hog is the only specie of domestic animals that becomes a host for the thorn-headed worm. The round-worm is a very common parasite. There are many species belonging to this class. .--Sheep are the most common hosts for this parasite. It is present in the gall ducts and livers, and causes a disease of the liver known as liver rot. The liver fluke is flat or leaf-like and from thirteen to fifteen mm. long . The head portion is conical. It has an oval and ventral sucker, and the body is covered with scaly spines. The eggs are oval and brownish in color. The life history, in brief, is as follows: Each adult is capable of producing an immense number of eggs which are carried down the bile ducts with the bile to the intestine, and are passed off with the faeces. Under favorable conditions for incubation, such as warm, moist surroundings, the ova or eggs hatch and the ciliated embryos become freed. The embryo next penetrates into the body of certain snails and encysts. The sporocyst, as it is now called, develops into a third generation known as redia which escape from the cyst. The daughter redia or cercaria, as they are now termed, leave the body of the snail and finally become encysted on the stems of grass, cresses and weeds. When taken into the digestive tract of the animal grazing over infested ground, the immature flukes are freed by the digestive juices. They then pass from the intestine into the bile ducts. The period of development varies from ten to twenty weeks; each sporocyst may give rise to from five to eight redia and each redia to from twelve to twenty cercaria. Fluke diseases occur among animals pastured on low, wet, undrained land. Drying ponds and lakes are the homes of the fresh water snails, and in such places there are plenty of hosts for the immature flukes. Wet seasons favor the development of this parasite. Cattle and sheep that pasture on river bottom land in certain sections of the southern portion of the United States are frequently affected with fluke diseases. The symptoms of liver rot of sheep may be divided into two stages. The first stage is marked by increase in weight and improved condition. In the second stage of the disease, the animal shows a pale skin and mucous membrane, dropsical swellings, loss of flesh and weakness. The character of the symptoms of the disease depends on the age of the animals and the care that they receive. Young, poorly cared for animals suffer severely from the disease, and the death rate is usually heavy. The finding of fluke ova in the faeces is conclusive evidence of the nature of the disease. It may be advisable to kill one of the sick animals, and determine the nature of the disease by a post-mortem examination. The treatment is preventive.""","""Parasitic diseases in domestic animals""","2063","""Parasitic diseases pose a significant threat to the health and well-being of domestic animals around the world. From dogs and cats to livestock such as cows, sheep, and poultry, these parasites can cause a range of symptoms and health issues in animals, impacting their quality of life and potentially leading to serious complications if left untreated. Understanding the types of parasites that can affect domestic animals, their modes of transmission, symptoms, prevention, and treatment is crucial for effective management and control of these diseases.  One of the most common types of parasites that affect domestic animals are internal parasites, including worms such as roundworms, hookworms, tapeworms, and whipworms. These parasites typically infect the gastrointestinal tract of animals, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, lethargy, and poor coat condition. In severe cases, internal parasites can cause anemia, malnutrition, and even death, especially in young or immunocompromised animals.  External parasites, such as fleas, ticks, mites, and lice, are another common threat to domestic animals. These parasites can cause skin irritation, itching, hair loss, and in some cases, transmit serious diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Controlling external parasites through regular grooming, use of appropriate insecticides, and environmental management is essential to prevent infestations and protect the health of animals.  In addition to internal and external parasites, some domestic animals are also susceptible to blood-borne parasites such as heartworms, which are transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Heartworm disease can be life-threatening if left untreated, causing damage to the heart and lungs and potentially leading to heart failure. Prevention through the use of monthly heartworm preventatives is key to protecting animals from this serious parasite.  Identifying parasitic diseases in domestic animals can be challenging, as symptoms may vary depending on the type of parasite involved and the severity of the infection. Regular veterinary check-ups, fecal examinations, and blood tests are important tools for diagnosing parasitic diseases early and implementing appropriate treatment protocols. In some cases, diagnostic imaging techniques such as x-rays or ultrasounds may be necessary to detect certain parasites or assess the extent of organ damage.  Treatment for parasitic diseases in domestic animals typically involves the administration of anthelmintic medications to eliminate internal parasites or ectoparasiticides to control external parasites. In cases of severe infection, supportive care such as intravenous fluids, nutritional support, and blood transfusions may be needed to help the animal recover. It is important to follow the veterinarian's recommendations for dosing and treatment duration to ensure the complete eradication of parasites and prevent re-infection.  Preventing parasitic diseases in domestic animals requires a multi-faceted approach that includes regular deworming, vaccination, parasite control products, good hygiene practices, and environmental management. Keeping living areas clean and free of feces, providing fresh water, and maintaining a balanced diet can help boost the immune system and reduce the risk of parasitic infections. Additionally, practicing good flea and tick prevention strategies, such as using topical treatments or collars, can help protect animals from external parasites.  Education plays a crucial role in raising awareness about parasitic diseases in domestic animals and promoting preventive measures among pet owners and livestock producers. Veterinary professionals can provide valuable information about the risks of parasitic infections, the importance of regular preventive care, and the proper use of parasite control products. By working together to implement effective prevention strategies and treatment protocols, we can help safeguard the health and well-being of domestic animals and minimize the impact of parasitic diseases on animal populations.""","730"
"James George Wharton","""They seem to take a pride in believing, as did Dickens' Mantalini in Nicholas Nickleby, that 'We are all going to the demnition bow-wows.' What a contrast there is between this man and the Cheeryble Brothers of the same book, those great and simple-hearted human reservoirs of cheerfulness and optimism, radiating sweetness, happiness, content, wherever they went, blessing and benefiting every heart willing to accept the sweetness and purity of theirs. Pessimism is not a working theory of life. It is the substitution of gloomy, deep-blue spectacles for the beautiful luminous ones. As Dr. Gulick says: Pessimism is negative, denial, believing that the evil is more than the good, that life is not worth while; it is a dampening down of life. Pessimism tends to its own annihilation, because it takes away life's motives, life's vigor, life's power. On the other hand, optimism cheers, encourages, brightens, beautifies, glorifies, blesses, helps. And I long ago learned that that man, that woman, who succeeds in helping and benefiting and blessing mankind is essentially an optimist. The other day I saw the act of an optimist. He and a friend were seated in a street car. It was Saturday night, the car was crowded, and by and by two well-dressed men got in, one of them with an unmistakable look of refinement, the other somewhat coarse looking. Both had evidently been drinking heavily. The more refined and elder of the two could barely stand upright, as the car whirled around the curves. The optimist looked up, saw the state of affairs, and in the sweetest, gentlest manner arose and extended his hand and bade the elderly gentleman take his seat. There was no look of reproach or disgust, and yet I know that he was a rigid abstainer and strong temperance worker and one who hated every form of indulgence in alcoholic liquors. The companion of the man who had taken the seat, began to talk in the ordinary mumbling, rambling, effusive style of the drunkard, and the other without either impatience or any sign of disapproval, quietly entered into the conversation, and I speak only the fact when I state that without any preaching or fault-finding, his few earnest, sincere, optimistic words so won the heart of that large, coarse-looking, drunken man that he seemed absolutely sobered and responded to the higher call of the soul. This is what optimism and cheerfulness do for mankind, hence I want to radiate it more and more. Mark Twain was full of this spirit of radiating cheerfulness. In one of his darkest hours in San Francisco, before he had gained name or fame, things had gone wrong and a lady friend passing along a street saw him standing beside a lamp-post with a cigar-box under his arm. 'Cigars?' she asked. 'Where are you going in such a hurry?' 'I'm m-o-o-v-i-n-g,' drawled Mark, at the same time displaying the contents of the box which consisted of a pair of socks, a pipe, and two paper collars. Even in his darkest hours he was able to look out upon the bright side, and out from those hours of gloom came some of the brightest pieces of wit and cheerful philosophy to irradiate and bless the entire world. If I were an employer of labor and could get the right men and women to do the work, I would employ a half dozen for my factory or workshop to teach my employees to be cheerful, to laugh and sing at their work. It would be a good paying investment. I would get a great deal more work out of my employees and of a great deal better quality. A hearty laugh is better than a bottle of medicine; a volume of Mark Twain or Marshall Wilder, better than a library of pessimistic philosophy of high sounding phrases. Cheerfulness takes the jolts out of the rutty road of life. It is an extra pair of springs to the wagon. It is an automobile shock-absorber. It resists the encroachments of the grouch and bids the blue devils avaunt! The old-fashioned methods of kings having a clown to keep them and their court laughing during meal time was a profound piece of philosophy and wisdom, for the stomach's sake, if for no other reason. The folly of the clown caused laughter, promoted genial humor which increased the flow of all the digestive juices and thus contributed to good digestion and perfect assimilation. The uncheerful father or mother who sits down to the table like a thundercloud and suppresses the bright, happy exuberance of childhood ought to be taken down to the dentist and pumped full of laughing-gas until he or she would laugh for a week. I would make such people laugh until their sides ached and they had to go to bed to get over it, and every time a frown or gloomy look came over the face I would have somebody lift a warning threaten them with another week's dose of laughing-gas. 'But,' says the gloomy one, 'life has gone wrong with me. How can I be cheerful when I am out of work and sick and have no friends?' Your case is hard, my friend. I recognize it with sympathy, but let me tell you this, that every grouchy look and word will make it harder for you to get work, and will put friendship further away from you. Even as a business proposition, it does not pay. Make yourself laugh and be cheerful, whether you can be or not, for very few men are willing to surround themselves with those who appear to be gloomy, depressed and grouchy. Learn the lesson that it does no good to indulge in self-pity. Whatever the adverse circumstances of life may be, face them like a man. Years ago I had learned this lesson of refusal to pity myself, and I then wrote: 'I want to radiate a spirit that refuses to pity itself for any of its woes, its afflictions, its misfortunes, its sorrows. There is no weakness so weak as the weakness of self-pity; there is nothing so spiritually debilitating as to brood over one's own sorrows. It is a kind of melancholy selfishness; it neither helps one's self nor others; it is depressing to all concerned. I happened to read to-day in a popular novel a sentence that most truthfully expresses what I believe upon this subject: 'The most absolutely selfish thing in the world is to give way to depression, to think of one's troubles at all, except of how to overcome them. I spend many delightful hours thinking of the pleasant and beautiful things of life. I decline to waste a single second even in considering the ugly ones.' 'It is just as easy to form a habit of dwelling upon the sweet and good and beautiful and happy things of life as upon the bitter and evil and ugly and unhappy things. Brooding enlarges whatever it exercises itself upon, whether it be good or evil, joy or woe. So brood on the good things, cast out the others, and so live that you radiate this joy and determination not to recognize the evil and unpleasant things. 'Self-pity takes the backbone out of one. It robs one of his manhood, his courage, his daring to go on and face all the difficulties before him. It is self-pity that makes the suicide. He looks at his woes, his difficulties, until he cannot bear them, and so goes and takes the big plunge into the dark. 'Brother, sister, quit your self-pitying. There is another side to the darkness. Look up, not down. Remember that, in the words of Robert Browning, 'God's in His heaven, all's right with the world.' So I have long resolved to radiate cheerfulness as much when I am down, as when I am up--when misfortune glowers upon me, as when fortune smiles. It is so easy to interpret our material good as a proof of God's favor, and our material ill as a sign that He is displeased with us. Those who went to Jesus and asked, when the tower of Siloam fell and killed eighteen: 'Were they not sinners above all others because this thing happened to them?' are not without their myriads of counterparts in the world to-day. When a man strikes a new gusher in an oil region, or a good flow of water in a desert country, or his grainfield gives him seventy bushels to the acre, it is easy enough to believe that Providence is smiling upon him, and, therefore, his faith is strong and unquenchable. I have enough of that kind of faith. I can radiate that without an effort or thought. But I desire above all things to radiate a like sure and definite faith when my neighbor strikes a gusher and I do not; when my enemy finds a fine flow of water and my crops are being parched--I want as strong a sense of contentment when Fortune smiles upon the other fellow, as when it smiles upon me.' This leads to another practical radiance. It is that of absolute certainty that things do not happen. There is no such thing as a 'happenstance' in the world. 'Nothing happens,' is a word often on my inner lips. There is no evil, no wrong, no misfortune to the man who consciously lives with power ever surrounding him. In our short-sightedness, we dream, we think of evil, or ill, or wrong, or misfortune, but if our faith's eyes were always open, we should see nothing but good--and that all circumstances are good in their ultimate results upon us. Some years ago I met a lady who possessed this spirit of radiant cheerfulness, and yet she was in a sanitarium and had undergone several severe surgical operations. In conversation with her, I learned that some years before she had found herself afflicted with a tumor in her breast. The surgeon said that nothing but the knife would remove it. This seemed almost like a sentence to death, and my friend and her husband, children, and friends were deeply saddened by the necessity. They all went through a period of deep gloom, of darkness, of despondency.""","""Optimism versus Pessimism in Life""","2134","""Optimism and pessimism are two contrasting philosophies that shape how individuals perceive and approach life. Optimism is the belief that favorable outcomes are likely, while pessimism anticipates negative results. Both perspectives play significant roles in influencing one's mindset, behavior, and overall well-being. Understanding the implications of optimism and pessimism can provide insight into how individuals navigate challenges, achieve goals, and maintain resilience in the face of adversity.  Optimism, characterized by a positive outlook and hopeful attitude, is often associated with resilience, perseverance, and emotional well-being. Optimists tend to view setbacks as temporary and specific to certain situations rather than as pervasive and permanent. This mindset enables them to bounce back from disappointments, failures, and obstacles with greater ease. Research has shown that optimists are more likely to adopt proactive problem-solving strategies, seek social support, and exhibit higher levels of motivation and persistence in pursuing their goals.  Moreover, optimism has been linked to improved physical health outcomes. Studies suggest that individuals who maintain a positive outlook on life may experience lower levels of stress, reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, and enhanced immune function. The ability of optimists to cope effectively with stressors and maintain a sense of hope and agency contributes to their overall well-being and longevity. Embracing an optimistic outlook can also foster stronger social connections and enhance one's ability to find meaning and purpose in life.  On the other hand, pessimism, characterized by a negative perspective and a tendency to expect unfavorable outcomes, can have detrimental effects on one's mental health and overall quality of life. Pessimists often dwell on past failures, exhibit self-limiting beliefs, and struggle to envision a brighter future. This mindset can lead to feelings of helplessness, anxiety, and depression, making it challenging to navigate life's challenges and setbacks effectively.  Pessimism can also interfere with one's ability to form meaningful relationships, pursue goals, and maintain motivation in the face of adversity. The tendency to anticipate failure and focus on obstacles can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, reinforcing negative outcomes and limiting personal growth. Pessimists may also struggle with maintaining a sense of hope, agency, and resilience, further exacerbating their feelings of distress and dissatisfaction.  Despite the challenges associated with pessimism, it is essential to recognize that both optimism and pessimism have their place in the human experience. While excessive pessimism can be detrimental, a healthy dose of realistic caution and skepticism can protect individuals from unrealistic expectations and potential risks. In some situations, a pessimistic outlook may prompt individuals to anticipate challenges, plan for contingencies, and take necessary precautions to mitigate potential threats.  Moreover, individuals may fluctuate between optimism and pessimism depending on the circumstances they face. Adapting to changing situations and adopting a flexible mindset that combines elements of both optimism and pessimism can enhance one's ability to navigate life's complexities effectively. Recognizing the strengths and limitations of each perspective can empower individuals to cultivate a balanced outlook that embraces hope, resilience, and pragmatism.  Cultivating optimism in the face of adversity requires practice, self-awareness, and intentional efforts to reframe negative thoughts and beliefs. Strategies such as practicing gratitude, visualizing success, setting realistic goals, and surrounding oneself with positive influences can help individuals cultivate a more optimistic mindset. Building resilience through challenges, seeking support from others, and reframing setbacks as opportunities for growth can also contribute to a more hopeful outlook on life.  In conclusion, the interplay between optimism and pessimism significantly influences how individuals perceive, interpret, and respond to the world around them. While optimism offers a pathway to resilience, motivation, and well-being, pessimism can serve as a cautionary reminder of potential risks and challenges. By embracing the strengths of both perspectives and cultivating a balanced outlook, individuals can navigate life's ups and downs with greater clarity, grace, and resilience. Ultimately, the choice between optimism and pessimism lies in how individuals choose to interpret the world and shape their narratives, influencing their journey towards fulfillment and joy.""","808"
"Ovid 44 BCE 18 ","""The mean average length of such books is 64 lines; and the next longest after Ex Ponto IV is Am III, with 24 that the order of the poems indicates that Ovid survived to publish or at least to arrange the book: the fact that the first and penultimate poems are addressed to Sextus Pompeius indicates that Ovid dedicated the book to him. Professor R. J. Tarrant points out to me correspondences of structure between EP IV and some of Ovid's earlier books. If the sixteenth and final poem of EP IV is considered a sphragis-poem, as is indicated by Nasonis in the opening line, we are left with a fifteen-poem book of which the first and last poems are addressed to Sextus Pompeius, and in which the middle poem is addressed to Germanicus through his client Suillius. The same structural outline of --5/8 appears in Amores I and III--the opening and closing poems of both books are concerned with Ovid's verse, while the eighth poem of each book stands somewhat apart from the other poems: Am I viii is about the procuress Dipsas, while III the elegy on the death of Tibullus. Ovid's addressees in Ex Ponto IV Sextus Pompeius, consul ordinarius in 4, and himself a relative of Augustus, is the recipient of no less than four letters in EP IV. It is significant that he is not the recipient of any of Ovid's earlier letters from exile; this is discussed in the next section. In the attention Ovid gives Sextus Pompeius there can be seen, according to Syme (HO 5/86), a deliberate attempt to gain the favour of Germanicus, who is mentioned in connection with Sextus Pompeius at v 5/8. It is interesting that in viii Ovid addresses Germanicus' quaestor Suillius (and in the course of the poem addresses Germanicus), and that the recipient of xiii is Carus, the tutor of Germanicus' sons. But it is only natural that Ovid, when at last permitted, should address so influential a man as his benefactor Sextus Pompeius; and it does not seem strange that he should address his fellow poet Carus, still less that he should send a letter to Suillius, husband of his stepdaughter Perilla. C. Pomponius Graecinus, the recipient of ix, must have had some political influence, since the poem is in celebration of his becoming suffect consul in 6. But he probably owed this influence to his brother Flaccus, a close friend of Tiberius who succeeded Graecinus as consul ordinarius for 7, and whom Ovid gives prominent mention at ix 7 ff. Graecinus must have been an old associate of Ovid, since he has the rare distinction of being mentioned by name in a poem written by Ovid before his exile (Am II x ). Two of Ovid's correspondents were orators. Gallio, the addressee of the eleventh poem, is frequently quoted by the elder Seneca. He was a senator; both Tacitus and Dio give accounts of how he fell into disfavour with Tiberius for proposing that ex-members of the Praetorian guard be granted the privilege of using the theatre seats reserved for members of the equestrian order (Ann VI; ). Brutus, the recipient of the sixth poem and dedicatee of the first three books of the Ex Ponto, is not mentioned by other writers, but it appears from vi 9-8 that he had a considerable reputation as a forensic orator, although some allowance must be made for possible exaggeration in Ovid's description of his close friend. The poem contains six lines on the death of Fabius Maximus, to whom Ovid had addressed EP I ii and III iii; perhaps he and Brutus had been associates. Five epistles are addressed to Ovid's fellow poets. Cornelius Severus, the recipient of the second poem, was one of the most famous epic poets of the day; he is mentioned by prefect of the region around Tomis, he presumably had some control over Ovid's circumstances. The traitorous friend to whom the third poem is addressed was a real person, for Ovid is quite explicit when speaking of their past together and of the friend's perfidy towards him; the same cannot be said of the inuidus to whom is addressed the concluding poem of the book, a defence of Ovid's reputation as a poet. Cotta Maximus, the younger son of Tibullus' patron Messalla, is prominently mentioned at xvi 1-4 as an unpublished poet of outstanding excellence. He is the recipient of six letters in the earlier books of the Ex Ponto. Syme finds it significant that there is no poem in EP IV addressed to Cotta: 'Ovid. was now concentrating his efforts elsewhere: Germanicus, the friends of Germanicus, Sextus Pompeius. The tardy tribute may perhaps be interpreted as a veiled reproach' (HO 28). But arguments from silence are dangerous; and Ovid's mention of Cotta seems flattering enough. It is perhaps safer to postulate a change in Ovid's feelings towards his wife. She is never mentioned in EP IV, although she had been the recipient of some eight earlier letters from liber ut fieret, sed uti sua cuique daretur littera, propositum curaque nostra fuit. postmodo collectas utcumque sine ordine iunxi: hoc opus electum ne mihi forte putes. da ueniam scriptis, quorum non gloria nobis causa, sed utilitas officiumque fuit. (1-6) Ovid's explanation is reasonable enough, and is confirmed by the speed with which he composed the first three books of the Ex Ponto once he knew that it was safe to name people in his verse. The first three books of the Ex Ponto, like the Tristia, were written with the single objective of securing Ovid's recall, and this naturally caused a certain repetition of subject-matter. By the time Ovid wrote the poems that would form the fourth book of the Ex Ponto, he had lived in Tomis for six or more years, and it must have been clear to him that his chances of recall were slight. The result of this is a diminished use of his personal situation as a theme for his verse. Often he introduces his plight in only one or two distichs of a poem, subordinating the topic to the poem's main theme. The result of this technique can be seen in such extended passages as the descriptions of the investiture of the new consul (iv & ix), the address to Germanicus on the power of poetry (viii), or the catalogue of poets that concludes the book. In all of these passages Ovid's desire for recall is only a secondary theme. The mixing of levels of diction As well as variety of subject, the fourth book of the Ex Ponto shows a variation in style that is typical of Ovid's letters from exile. The poems use the metre and language of elegiac verse. But at the same time they are letters, and are strongly influenced by the structure and vocabulary of prose epistles.""","""Ovid's Ex Ponto IV analysis""","1515","""Ovid's """"Ex Ponto IV"""" offers a poignant reflection on the dual themes of love and exile. This epistolary poem, written during Ovid's exile in Tomis by the Black Sea, showcases his mastery of language and emotion as he delves into the depths of his isolation and longing for the beloved he left behind. Through a series of letters addressed to various recipients, Ovid pours out his heart, expressing his anguish, nostalgia, and despair in eloquent and evocative verses.  The poem begins with Ovid addressing his wife, urging her to remember him despite the physical distance that separates them. He longs for her company, reminiscing about the times they shared and the love they once cultivated. His words are filled with yearning and a sense of loss, emphasizing the emotional toll that exile has taken on him. Ovid's introspection delves deep into the complexities of human emotions, highlighting the universal experience of love and separation.  As """"Ex Ponto IV"""" progresses, Ovid's letters to his wife are interspersed with missives to his friends and patrons. Through these additional correspondences, Ovid reveals the extent of his isolation and the profound impact exile has had on his sense of self. He seeks solace in the memories of his former life, drawing strength from the relationships he once cherished. However, the stark reality of his current situation looms large, casting a shadow over his hopes and dreams.  Ovid's skill as a poet shines through in his adept use of imagery and metaphor. He compares his exile to a ship lost at sea, adrift and directionless. The desolation of his surroundings mirrors the turmoil within his soul, creating a sense of existential despair that pervades the poem. Through his vivid descriptions and vivid language, Ovid invites readers to share in his pain and longing, forging a connection that transcends time and space.  The themes of love and exile intersect and intertwine throughout """"Ex Ponto IV,"""" illuminating the delicate balance between passion and suffering. Ovid's exploration of these themes offers a profound meditation on the human condition, highlighting the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. His vulnerability and raw emotion resonate with readers, inviting them to reflect on their own experiences of love and loss.  One of the most striking aspects of """"Ex Ponto IV"""" is Ovid's emotional honesty. He bares his soul on the page, laying bare his fears, regrets, and desires with unflinching candor. This rawness and vulnerability are what make Ovid's work so enduring and relatable, transcending the boundaries of time and culture. His willingness to confront his innermost feelings with such clarity and depth speaks to the power of artistic expression as a means of catharsis and connection.  In addition to its emotional depth, """"Ex Ponto IV"""" also serves as a historical document, providing valuable insights into the realities of exile in ancient Rome. Ovid's descriptions of his surroundings, his interactions with the local populace, and his reflections on the political climate of the time offer a glimpse into the challenges faced by those who were banished from their homeland. Through his personal experiences, Ovid sheds light on the broader social and political dynamics of his era, enriching our understanding of the past.  The language and style of """"Ex Ponto IV"""" are quintessentially Ovidian, characterized by their elegance, wit, and sophistication. Ovid's lyrical prose captivates the reader, drawing them into his world of longing and lamentation. His use of rhetorical devices such as apostrophe, metaphor, and allusion adds layers of meaning to his writing, inviting readers to engage with his work on multiple levels.

As the poem reaches its conclusion, Ovid's tone shifts from despair to resignation. He accepts his fate with a sense of melancholy acceptance, acknowledging the futility of resistance in the face of overwhelming odds. Despite his sorrow and longing, Ovid finds a measure of peace in the act of writing, finding solace in the beauty and power of language to transcend his physical limitations. In this final act of defiance, Ovid asserts his identity as a poet and a lover, reclaiming agency in a world that seeks to suppress his voice.  In conclusion, Ovid's """"Ex Ponto IV"""" stands as a testament to the enduring power of art to express the deepest truths of the human experience. Through its exploration of love, exile, and the resilience of the human spirit, Ovid's poem resonates across the centuries, speaking to the eternal verities of the heart. By delving into the complexities of emotion and identity, Ovid invites readers to ponder their own lives and relationships, finding solace and illumination in the beauty of his words.""","990"
"Bechtel John Hendricks 1841 ","""The principal parts of the first verb are lie, lay, lain; and of the second, lay, laid, laid. The word lay is found in both, and this is, in part, accountable for the confusion. The most frequent errors result from using laid, the past tense form of the transitive verb, when the word lay, the past tense form of the intransitive verb, should be used. The ear naturally expects the usual past tense ending of the d or t sound, and as that is absent in the past tense of lie, the past tense form of the other verb is substituted. For the same reason the participle form laid is often incorrectly used for lain. He told me to lie down, and I lay down, not laid down. I told him to lay the book down, and he laid it down. The ship lay at anchor. They lay by during the storm. The book is lying on the shelf. He lay on the ground and took cold. They lay in ambush. Lie low or he will discover you. The goods are still lying on his hands. Time lay heavily on their hands. We must lie over at the next station. A motion was made that the resolution lie on the table. Now I lie down to sleep. Now I lay me down to sleep. The foregoing sentences illustrate the correct usage of these confusing verbs. As, That Did your cousin go to town yesterday? Not as I know. Better, Not that I know. Better still, I do not know. I do not know as I shall go. Use that for as. Bad toothache As it is a rare thing to have a good toothache, we scarcely need the adjective bad to distinguish between the two kinds of toothache. Say severe. Beautifully, Beautiful After verbs of seeing, feeling, tasting, and smelling, the adverb is often incorrectly used for the adjective. The colonel looked handsomely in his military dress, I feel splendidly to-day, This peach tastes badly, The rose smells sweetly, are incorrect. Use handsome for handsomely, very well or in good spirits for splendidly, tastes bad or has a disagreeable taste for badly, and sweet for sweetly. Beg, Beg leave I beg to announce the sale of a collection of rare and costly rugs. I beg to acknowledge your kindness in sending me this handsome present. In each case say I beg leave to, etc. Due, Owing His success was due to his honesty and energy. That is due which should be paid as a debt; that is owing which is referred to as a cause or source. The bill is now due and payable at the gas office. His success was owing to his honesty and energy. Each, Every I see him at his office each day of the week. In this sentence the word every would be better. Each refers to single days particularized. Here reference is made to what occurs on all days without exception. Both words refer to nouns in the singular, hence such expressions as the following are incorrect: Every soldier and sailor stood at their post. The prisoners were discharged and went each their several ways. Correct by saying, The prisoners were discharged and went each his several way, Every soldier and sailor stood at his post. Each, Both Both parties maintained their original positions. As the parties are thought of separately, the sentence should be: Each party maintained its original position. Both parties strove to place their best candidates upon the ticket is correct, because the parties are thought of collectively. Both, Both of Both is used alone before nouns and both of before pronouns. Both men have studied the currency question. Both of them are well informed in matters relating to the currency. Ever, Never Let him be ever so rich, says Emerson. You spend ever so much money in entertaining your equals and betters, says Thackeray. Though he run ever so fast, he cannot win the race. Writers and grammarians differ, some preferring ever, others never. Every once in a while This is a cumbersome, awkward expression that should be avoided. Occasionally, frequently, at intervals, are among the expressions that may be used in its place. Exceptionable, Exceptional He enjoyed exceptionable opportunities for acquiring the Greek language. Say exceptional opportunities. Female, Woman The word female is often employed when woman would be better. Female applies to all of the feminine gender, including the brute creation. Poet, Poetess The tendency to increase the number of nouns with the feminine ending ess should be checked. Avoid poetess, authoress, doctress, and other newly-invented words of this kind. Fewer, Less Fewer refers to number, less to quantity. He had less friends than I, and yet he was elected. Say He had fewer friends. There were no less than fifty cows in the field. Use fewer. Right smart In some portions of the South the expression right smart is employed in colloquial discourse to convey the idea of a large quantity or in large measure; as, We have right smart of peaches this summer, meaning We have a large crop of peaches; He knows right smart of Latin for He knows considerable Latin or He is well versed in Latin. Little bit Will you have some of this pudding? If you please. Give me a little bit. Did you injure yourself when you fell? No; but I soiled my clothing a little bit. A small portion or piece, in the first sentence, and slightly, in the second, would serve as good equivalents for a little bit. Sight There was a sight of people at the fair to-day. In the sense of a large number, this word, like the word lot, should be avoided. Crowd A dozen persons may constitute a crowd if they push and jostle one another by reason of insufficient space. A thousand men will not form a crowd if all have ample room to sit or stand or move about. Chuck-full This word is not authorized. Chock-full and choke-full may be used, but are not elegant. Contemplate, Propose Contemplate is often incorrectly used for propose; as, I contemplate going to the country. Dispense, Dispense with These expressions are not synonymous. To dispense is to give; to dispense with is to do without. The pharmacist dispenses medicines; we should be pleased if we could dispense with them. Dry, Thirsty Dry is often incorrectly used in the sense of thirsty; as, I am dry; let me have a glass of water. To say, I am dry; my waterproof and umbrella kept out the rain, is correct. Dutch, German Do not call a German a Dutchman. A Dutchman comes from Holland, a German from Germany. Evacuate, Vacate Evacuate means to make empty, and should not be used in the sense of to go away, to vacate. Different than, Different to The school is conducted in a very different manner than it used to be. This basket of roses is different to yours. The above and similar expressions are decided vulgarisms, and should be avoided. The school is conducted in a very different manner from what it used to be. This basket of roses is different from yours. Drive, Ride Some confusion exists in the use of the words drive and ride. In England the distinction is made of applying ride to going on horseback and drive to going in a carriage, whether you ride or drive. That usage is not closely followed in this country. He who guides the horse drives; the rest of the company ride. The noun and participial forms are more excusable than the verb. Jones asked me to drive with him this afternoon. But as Jones expects to do the driving himself, the speaker should have said, Jones asked me to take a ride, or go driving, or take a drive, etc. Couple, Several The word couple is often incorrectly used in the sense of several; as, a couple of horses, mules, birds, trees, houses, etc. The use of the word couple is not only limited to two, but to two that may be coupled or yoked together. A man and wife are spoken of as a couple. We speak of a span of horses, a yoke of oxen, a brace of ducks, a pair of gloves. Directly, Immediately, As soon as A faulty English use of the above words has found some favor in the United States. Directly the whistle blew the workmen left the shop. Say As soon as the whistle blew, etc. Immediately he closed his speech his opponent rose to reply. Say When or As soon as he closed his speech, etc. Directly denotes without any delay; immediately implies without any interposition of other occupation. Agreeably disappointed When our hopes are blasted, our plans balked, our expectations defeated, our intentions thwarted, we are disappointed. We prefer the agreeable to the disagreeable, and plan and labor to secure it. When our plans fail we are disappointed, but not agreeably disappointed. If the new conditions, which are not of our seeking, prove agreeable, it is only after the sense of disappointment has vanished. Allude to, Refer to, Mention The word allude is often incorrectly used. Allusion is the by-play of language. It means to hint at by remote suggestions, to speak of figuratively or sportively. Whatever is directly mentioned, or spoken of, or described, cannot be said to be alluded to. The terms differ in degree, the first being the weakest. An allusion is an indirect reference. Among the rest Mary sat on the beach among the rest. Say with the rest. Peruse This is one of those high-sounding terms too often employed when read would be much better. Emigrants, Immigrants These words are sometimes confounded. Did you see the emigrants on the Indiana, which arrived this morning? Did the immigrants go directly to Italy? Exchange the italicized words in the two sentences and they will be correctly used. Somewheres The terminal s should be omitted in such words as anywheres, somewheres, nowheres, anyways, hereabouts, thereabouts, whereabouts. In such cases as Whereabouts did you find him? and We knew his whereabouts, the s is properly retained. Apart, Aside May I see you apart from the others? It should be, May I see you privately or aside? Fire, Throw We fire a gun, but throw a stone. To fire a stone, fire him out of the house, fire him out of our employ, may be graphic ways of presenting the thought, but good writers never use them and good speakers should avoid them. The First, Single I have not found the first objection to his candidacy.""","""Grammar and Usage Errors""","2195","""Grammar and Usage Errors  Grammar and usage errors are common mistakes that can significantly impact the clarity and effectiveness of written communication. Whether in academic papers, professional emails, or casual social media posts, errors in grammar and usage can detract from the intended message, reduce credibility, and create confusion for readers. Understanding common grammar and usage errors, as well as how to correct them, is essential for effective communication in any setting.  Subject-Verb Agreement  One of the most common grammar errors is subject-verb agreement, where the subject of a sentence does not match the verb in number. For example, """"The team play well"""" should be """"The team plays well"""" because """"team,"""" a singular noun, requires the singular verb """"plays."""" To avoid this error, always ensure that the verb agrees with the subject in terms of singular or plural form.  Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement  Another frequent mistake is pronoun-antecedent agreement, which occurs when a pronoun does not agree in number, gender, or person with its antecedent. For instance, in the sentence """"Each student must bring their own textbook,"""" """"their"""" does not agree with the singular antecedent """"each student."""" To correct this error, use """"his or her"""" to ensure agreement with the singular antecedent.  Run-On Sentences and Sentence Fragments  Run-on sentences and sentence fragments are common errors that can disrupt the flow and coherence of writing. A run-on sentence occurs when two independent clauses are joined without appropriate punctuation or conjunctions, such as in """"I went to the store I bought some groceries."""" To correct this, use a comma and a coordinating conjunction or separate the clauses into two sentences. On the other hand, sentence fragments are incomplete sentences that lack a subject, verb, or complete thought, like """"Running in the park."""" To fix this error, integrate the fragment into a complete sentence or add the necessary elements.  Misplaced and Dangling Modifiers  Misplaced modifiers and dangling modifiers can lead to ambiguity and confusion in a sentence. A misplaced modifier is a word or phrase that is in the wrong place, altering the intended meaning of a sentence. For example, """"I only eat organic food"""" may imply that the action of eating is the only thing done with organic food, when the intended meaning is likely """"I eat only organic food."""" Dangling modifiers, on the other hand, do not have a clear referent in the sentence, leading to awkward constructions. For instance, """"After studying hard, the test was easy"""" suggests that the test was studying hard. To correct these errors, place modifiers close to the words they describe and ensure they have a clear relationship with the rest of the sentence.  Word Choice and Usage  Correct word choice and usage are essential for effective communication. Common errors in this area include using the wrong word (e.g., """"affect"""" vs. """"effect""""), confusing similar words (e.g., """"its"""" vs. """"it's""""), and using words inappropriately (e.g., """"literally"""" for emphasis instead of its literal meaning). To improve word choice and usage, consult a dictionary or a style guide, and pay attention to the nuances of words to convey precise meaning in writing.  Spelling and Punctuation Errors  Spelling and punctuation errors can undermine the credibility and professionalism of written communication. Common spelling errors include typos, homophones (e.g., """"their,"""" """"there,"""" """"they're""""), and misspelled words due to confusion or lack of proofreading. Punctuation errors, such as missing commas, misplaced apostrophes, and incorrect use of semicolons, can affect the clarity and structure of sentences. To address these errors, use spelling and grammar checkers, proofread carefully, and reference style guides for correct punctuation usage.  Active vs. Passive Voice  Choosing between active and passive voice can impact the clarity and directness of writing. Active voice emphasizes the subject performing the action, while passive voice focuses on the action done to the subject. For example, """"The team won the championship"""" is active, whereas """"The championship was won by the team"""" is passive. While both voices have their uses, active voice is generally preferred for its straightforwardness and engagement. To improve clarity and impact, favor active voice whenever possible, especially in concise and direct communication.  Consistency in Style and Formatting  Maintaining consistency in style and formatting is crucial for professional and polished writing. Inconsistent formatting choices, such as alternating between British and American English spelling, mixing citation styles, or using inconsistent fonts, can distract readers and detract from the overall quality of the text. To ensure consistency, establish a style guide or adhere to a specific style manual (e.g., APA, MLA) for guidance on grammar, punctuation, citations, and formatting rules.  Clichés, Jargon, and Redundancies  Overusing clichés, jargon, and redundancies can weaken the impact of writing and make it less engaging for readers. Clichés are overused expressions that have lost their originality and effectiveness, while jargon can alienate readers who are not familiar with specialized terminology. Redundancies, such as """"free gift"""" or """"final outcome,"""" can be eliminated to streamline writing and improve clarity. To enhance the quality of writing, avoid clichés, limit jargon to relevant contexts, and eliminate unnecessary redundancies for concise and impactful communication.  Proofreading and Revision  Effective proofreading and revision are essential steps in catching and correcting grammar and usage errors. After completing a draft, take time to review the text for errors in grammar, punctuation, spelling, and style. Reading aloud, using spell checkers, and seeking feedback from peers or professionals can help identify and rectify mistakes. Additionally, revising for clarity, coherence, and conciseness can elevate the quality of writing and ensure that the intended message is communicated accurately and effectively.  In conclusion, mastering grammar and usage is fundamental for clear, effective, and credible communication in any context. By understanding and addressing common errors such as subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement, run-on sentences, misplaced modifiers, word choice, spelling, punctuation, active vs. passive voice, consistency in style, clichés, jargon, redundancies, and proofreading, writers can enhance the quality of their writing and engage readers more effectively. Continuous practice, feedback, and attention to detail are key to improving grammar and usage skills and producing compelling and polished written work.""","1314"
"Black Joseph","""It slowly precipitates the corrosive sublimate of mercury in the form of a black powder. It separates the volatile alkali in salt ammoniac from the acid, when it is mixed with a warm solution of that salt. But it does not separate an acid from a calcarious earth, nor does it induce the least change upon lime-water. Lastly, when a dram of it is digested with an ounce of water in a bottle for some hours, it does not make any the least change in the water. The magnesia, when dried, is found to have gained ten grains; but it neither effervesces with acids, nor does it sensibly affect lime-water. Observing magnesia to lose such a remarkable proportion of its weight in the fire, my next attempts were directed to the investigation of this volatile part, and, among other experiments, the following seemed to throw some light upon it. Three ounces of magnesia were distilled in a glass retort and receiver, the fire being gradually increased until the magnesia was obscurely red hot. When all was cool, I found only five drams of a whitish water in the receiver, which had a faint smell of the spirit of hartshorn, gave a green colour to the juice of violets, and rendered the solutions of corrosive sublimate and of silver very slightly turbid. But it did not sensibly effervesce with acids. The magnesia, when taken out of the retort, weighed an ounce, three drams, and thirty grains, or had lost more than the half of its weight. It still effervesced pretty briskly with acids, tho' not so strongly as before this operation. The fire should have been raised here to the degree requisite for the perfect calcination of magnesia. But even from this imperfect experiment, it is evident, that of the volatile parts contained in that powder, a small proportion only is water; the rest cannot, it seems, be retained in vessels, under a visible form. Chemists have often observed, in their distillations, that part of a body has vanished from their senses, notwithstanding the utmost care to retain it; and they have always found, upon further inquiry, that subtile part to be air, which having been imprisoned in the body, under a solid form, was set free and rendered fluid and elastic by the fire. We may therefore safely conclude, that the volatile matter, lost in the calcination of magnesia, is mostly air; and hence the calcined magnesia does not emit air, or make an effervescence, when mixed with acids. The water, from its properties, seems to contain a small portion of volatile alkali, which was probably formed from the earth, air, and water, or from some of these combined together; and perhaps also from a small quantity of inflammable matter which adhered accidentally to the magnesia. Whenever Chemists meet with this salt, they are inclined to ascribe its origin to some animal, or putrid vegetable, substance; and this they have always done, when they obtained it from the calcarious earths, all of which afford a small quantity of it. There is, however, no doubt that it can sometimes be produced independently of any such mixture, since many fresh vegetables and tartar afford a considerable quantity of it. And how can it, in the present instance, be supposed, that any animal or vegetable matter adhered to the magnesia, while it was dissolved by an acid, separated from this by an alkali, and washed with so much water? Two drams of magnesia were calcined in a crucible, in the manner described above, and thus reduced to two scruples and twelve grains. This calcined magnesia was dissolved in a sufficient quantity of spirit of vitriol, and then again separated from the acid by the addition of an alkali, of which a large quantity is necessary for this purpose. The magnesia being very well washed and dryed, weighed one dram and fifty grains. It effervesced violently, or emitted a large quantity of air, when thrown into acids, formed a red powder when mixed with a solution of sublimate, separated the calcarious earths from an acid, and sweetened lime-water: and had thus recovered all those properties which it had but just now lost by calcination: nor had it only recovered its original properties, but acquired besides an addition of weight nearly equal to what had been lost in the fire; and, as it is found to effervesce with acids, part of the addition must certainly be air. This air seems to have been furnished by the alkali from which it was separated by the acid; for Dr. Hales has clearly proved, that alkaline salts contain a large quantity of fixed air, which they emit in great abundance when joined to a pure acid. In the present case, the alkali is really joined to an acid, but without any visible emission of air; and yet the air is not retained in it: for the neutral salt, into which it is converted, is the same in quantity, and in every other respect, as if the acid employed had not been previously saturated with magnesia, but offered to the alkali in its pure state, and had driven the air out of it in their conflict. It seems therefore evident, that the air was forced from the alkali by the acid, and lodged itself in the magnesia. These considerations led me to try a few experiments, whereby I might know what quantity of air is expelled from an alkali, or from magnesia, by acids. Two drams of a pure fixed alkaline salt, and an ounce of water, were put into a Florentine flask, which, together with its contents, weighed two ounces and two drams. Some oil of vitriol diluted with water was dropt in, until the salt was exactly saturated; which it was found to be, when two drams, two scruples, and three grains of this acid had been added. The vial with its contents now weighed two ounces, four drams, and fifteen grains. One scruple, therefore, and eight grains were lost during the ebullition, of which a trifling portion may be water, or something of the same kind. The rest is air. The celebrated Homberg has attempted to estimate the quantity of solid salt contained in a determined portion of the several acids. He saturated equal quantities of an alkali with each of them; and, observing the weight which the alkali had gained, after being perfectly dryed, took this for the quantity of solid salt contained in that share of the acid which performed the saturation. But we learn from the above experiment, that his estimate was not accurate, because the alkali loses weight as well as gains it. Two drams of magnesia, treated exactly as the alkali in the last experiment, were just dissolved by four drams, one scruple, and seven grains of the same acid liquor, and lost one scruple and sixteen grains by the ebullition. Two drams of magnesia were reduced, by the action of a violent fire, to two scruples and twelve grains, with which the same process was repeated, as in the two last experiments; four drams, one scruple, and two grains of the same acid were required to compleat the solution, and no weight was lost in the experiment. As in the separation of the volatile from the fixed parts of bodies, by means of heat, a small quantity of the latter is generally raised with the former; so the air and water, originally contained in the magnesia, and afterwards dissipated by the fire, seem to have carried off a small part of the fixed earth of this substance. This is probably the reason, why calcined magnesia is saturated with a quantity of acid, somewhat less than what is required to dissolve it before calcination: and the same may be assigned as one cause which hinders us from restoring the whole of its original weight, by solution and precipitation. I took care to dilute the vitriolic acid, in order to avoid the heat and ebullition which it would otherwise have excited in the water; and I chose a Florentine flask, on account of its lightness, capacity, and shape, which is peculiarly adapted to the experiment; for the vapours raised by the ebullition circulated for a short time, thro' the wide cavity of the vial, but were soon collected upon its sides, like dew, and none of them seemed to reach the neck, which continued perfectly dry to the end of the experiment. We now perceive the reason, why crude and calcined magnesia, which differ in many respects from one another, agree however in composing the same kind of salt, when dissolved in any particular acid; for the crude magnesia seems to differ from the calcined chiefly by containing a considerable quantity of air, which air is unavoidably dissipated and lost during the dissolution. From our experiments, it seems probable, that the increase of weight which some metals acquire, by being first dissolved in acids, and then separated from them again by alkalis, proceeds from air furnished by the alkalis. And that in the aurum fulminans, which is prepared by the same means, this air adheres to the gold in such a peculiar manner, that, in a moderate degree of heat, the whole of it recovers its elasticity in the same instant of time; and thus, by the violent shock which it gives to the air around, produces the loud crack or fulmination of this powder. Those who will imagine the explosion of such a minute portion of fixed air, as can reside in the aurum fulminans, to be insufficient for the excessive loudness of the noise, will consider, that it is not a large quantity of motion communicated to the air, but rather a smart stroke which produces sound, and that the explosion of but a few particles of fixed air may be capable of causing a loud noise, provided they all recover their spring suddenly, and in the same instant. The above experiments lead us also to conclude, that volatile alkalis, and the common absorbent earths, which lose their air by being joined to acids, but shew evident signs of their having recovered it, when separated from them by alkalis, received it from these alkalis which lost it in the instant of their joining with the acid.""","""Chemistry of Magnesia and Reactions""","2156","""Magnesia, also known as magnesium oxide (MgO), is a vital inorganic compound noted for its versatile applications across various industries, including pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and construction. With its unique chemical properties and reactions, magnesia plays a crucial role in numerous processes and products. Understanding the chemistry of magnesia and its reactions is essential to harnessing its full potential and exploiting its benefits across a wide range of fields.  Chemically, magnesia is an alkaline earth metal oxide, consisting of a magnesium cation (Mg2+) and an oxide anion (O2-). This compound is most commonly produced through the calcination of magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide, which results in the release of carbon dioxide or water, respectively, leaving behind magnesium oxide as a white solid with high thermal stability.  One of the key characteristics of magnesia is its basic nature, which makes it an effective neutralizer of acids. When combined with an acidic substance, such as sulfuric acid, a chemical reaction occurs, producing magnesium sulfate and water. This reaction exemplifies the acid-base properties of magnesia and its ability to form salts through neutralization reactions.  In addition to its neutralization capabilities, magnesia exhibits a high thermal conductivity, making it an excellent refractory material for high-temperature applications. Its refractory properties stem from its ability to withstand extreme heat without degrading, making it indispensable in industries like steelmaking and cement production. Magnesia's refractory nature ensures the integrity and longevity of industrial processes by providing heat resistance and thermal insulation.  Furthermore, magnesia displays a remarkable capacity to absorb water, known as hygroscopicity. This property enables it to function as a desiccant in various applications, including moisture control in pharmaceuticals, food preservation, and humidity regulation in enclosed spaces. By effectively removing moisture from its surroundings, magnesia helps prevent spoilage, mold growth, and degradation of sensitive materials.  Magnesia's reactivity extends beyond its basic and refractory characteristics to include interactions with other compounds and elements. For instance, when magnesium oxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the presence of moisture, magnesium bicarbonate is formed. This reaction plays a crucial role in the natural weathering of rocks containing magnesia and contributes to the carbon cycle in the environment.  Moreover, magnesia demonstrates compatibility with organic compounds, leading to the formation of coordination complexes. This property has been harnessed in the pharmaceutical industry to develop magnesium-containing medications that utilize the compound's bioavailability and therapeutic properties. Magnesium oxide supplements, for example, are commonly used to address magnesium deficiencies and provide relief from acid indigestion.  In agricultural practices, magnesia serves as a crucial component of fertilizers, offering essential nutrients to promote plant growth and development. Magnesium deficiencies in soil can lead to stunted crop growth and reduced yields, making magnesia supplementation vital for maintaining soil fertility and agricultural productivity. By incorporating magnesia-based fertilizers, farmers can enhance the magnesium content of the soil and ensure optimal conditions for plant growth.  The versatility of magnesia extends further into environmental applications, where it is utilized in wastewater treatment processes. Magnesium oxide's alkaline properties facilitate the precipitation of heavy metals in contaminated water, aiding in their removal and remediation. By forming insoluble metal hydroxides, magnesia contributes to the purification of water sources and the protection of aquatic ecosystems.  In industrial settings, magnesia finds extensive use in the production of magnesium-based compounds, such as magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate. These derivatives of magnesia serve various purposes, including flame retardancy in polymers, acidity regulation in food products, and gas emission control in environmental engineering. The wide array of applications underscores the importance of magnesia in diverse industries and highlights its adaptability to meet different requirements.  The unique properties and reactions of magnesia make it a valuable resource with multifaceted benefits across numerous fields. From its role as a refractory material to its applications in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and environmental remediation, magnesia continues to showcase its versatility and importance in modern industries. By understanding the chemistry of magnesia and leveraging its reactivity in various processes, researchers, engineers, and manufacturers can unlock its full potential and innovate solutions that enhance efficiency, sustainability, and product performance.""","878"
"Stephens Henry 1883 ","""At the Avenida Pedro de Valdivia, a broad boulevard on which are magnificent villas and the summer homes of the wealthy Santiaguinos one turns to the right and keeps straight ahead until the main street of Nunoa is reached. Nunoa is a town of nine thousand inhabitants, a mixture of wealth and poverty with well shaded streets, poor shops, and adobe buildings. A few miles beyond Nunoa is a roadhouse named the Quinta Roma, which was formerly the mansion of an estanciero but is now the terminus for joy-riders, many of whom are to be met with returning to the capital late afternoons in a highly hilarious condition. To the credit of the Chileno joy-rider, he does not hit up the great speed of his North American brethren; thus there are but few automobile accidents. The roadhouse stands in a garden of flowers well back from the thoroughfare in a nicely kept lawn. Here is a liquid refreshment dispensary where I have seen gay youths hoist comely maidens upon the bar, and seated there clink glasses with their standing male affinities whose arms encircle their waists to the tune of popping corks and the metallic ring of beer caps as the latter fall to the floor. In the garden behind the bar is a bamboo thicket planted in the form of room partitions. It is so dense that no peeker can look through its foliage to observe the love affairs being enacted in these natural chambers which correspond to the European 'separees' or the so-called 'private dining rooms' of the North American roadhouses. At Apoquindo there are several soda springs with baths and a swimming pool all of which are kept in a filthy condition. Like at Cacheuta and at Cauquenes but few people come to take the baths and none to drink the water. Most everybody congregates at the bar in the hotel across the street--the baths are but the name of an excuse. X OF. CHILOE. LAKE In Lady Anne Brassey's nonpareil book, Around the World in the Yacht Sunbeam, published by Henry Holt and Company, New York, 882, she describes on pages 5/89-61 her visit to the Baths of Cauquenes where she sojourned two days, October 3-5/8, 876. When I was in Chile in 913, I never heard of these baths and returned home ignorant of their existence. In the interim I thoroughly read Lady Brassey's book and determined that if the opportunity ever presented itself that I would likewise visit them. Darwin visited them in 836. While in Santiago in 915/8, on looking at a map, I found that there was a city named Cauquenes in the Province of Maule in south-central Chile, it being the provincial capital. I had made up my mind to go to that place, when the bung-eyed girl who managed the Hotel Oddo showed me my error and informed me that the Cauquenes I was seeking, was not a great distance from Santiago and was reached by train from Rancagua. One morning I left the Alameda Station at.0 and two hours later arrived at Rancagua. The ride was through a fertile country, well tilled and with great vineyards. Only two towns of importance were passed, San Bernardo with 269 inhabitants which also has street-car connection with Santiago and Buin whose population is 713 inhabitants and is the county seat of the Department of Maipo in the Province of O'Higgins. The Andean and wine-producing province of O'Higgins, named in honor of the father of Chilean independence lies directly south of the rather large Province of Santiago, its boundary line being the Maipo River. Its population is 2,39. Rancagua, the provincial capital, is a dirty, odoriferous, dilapidated adobe city of 0,80 people with the outward appearance of decay. A walk down the main street which is named Brazil belies the general appearance of the town for its sidewalks throng with peasants from whose shoulders hang multicolored shawls. Horsemen wearing red ponchos, their spurs clanking, trot down the pebble-paved street that is lined with squalid one-story shops. Although only fifty-four miles south of Santiago, the place is a good market town; of the numerous shops those that deal in dry goods, draperies, and saddles appear to do the most lucrative trade. There is only one respectable appearing spot in the city, and that is the small plaza in the urban center which is embellished by a bronze equestrian statue of O'Higgins, his horse trampling a Spaniard. Of the several apologies for hotels, none were inviting and rather than to eat at one of their restaurants, it is best to go hungry. The only decent place to eat is at the railroad station. One of the taverns is named 'The North American' with a proprietor of our own nationality but its business is mostly bar trade, catering to the incoming and outgoing trade of the miners at El Teniente Mine. The day I was at Rancagua was Sunday which I was told was the day on which the prisoners of the jail were allowed to receive guests. I imagine that nearly everybody in the town either had relatives or friends in jail for in front of the building which is on the main street a mob had collected to await admittance. The inhabitants of the town are tanned dark brown, and although strongly built and powerful I noticed several who were afflicted with the same malignant blood disease which the Swiss guards imported into France from Italy during the Middle Ages. I was also surprised to see a little girl about twelve years old on the street who had the leprosy, the only case I have ever seen in Chile. The Braden Copper Company of North American ownership has a 1/2-foot gauge railroad that runs up to their copper mine, El Teniente, which is about forty-five miles up the Cachapoal River above Rancagua; the Baths of Cauquenes is one of their stations. This mine which was opened in 907 now has six hundred employees, many of whom are from the United States and Canada. From Rancagua the train ride of an hour and a half first crosses the Plain where fat cattle graze in knee high clover, and then skirts along the ledge of the mountains overlooking the broad terraces or selvas of the Cachapoal River, winding around promontories on a roadbed no wider than the coaches; any mishap would be sufficient to send the train rolling down the mountainside killing all the occupants of the cars. The station of Banos, (meaning Baths) is high above the gorge of the river. Across the canyon on a ledge of rocks can be seen the buildings of the thermal establishment, but before the pedestrian gets there he must walk a good half-mile. A foot path zigzags to the canyon bottom and an arm of the river is crossed by a cement bridge to a rocky islet. Another bridge, this one a swinging one, suspended above a whirlpool brings one again to terra firma on the left bank. One now ascends another zigzag path to a forest of elm, ash, and locust, the foliage being so thick that the sun's rays never penetrate it. Another suspension bridge which spans a silvery cascade is reached and beyond it is the hotel, a low, squat adobe building painted red, whose many rooms open onto two patios. The name Cauquenes is Araucanian meaning wild pigeon. This bird, the ectopistes migratorius, sometimes called the voyager pigeon or the wood pigeon originally had its range from Labrador to the Straits of Magellan. Half a century ago they were numerous in the United States, but in this country they have been absolutely exterminated due to their having been killed off by hunters; great numbers which escaped the gun were burned in the Arkansas forest fires four decades ago. Chile is the only country on the face of this earth where they still exist, and it is probable that they will continue to live there as the inhabitants are extremely averse to killing them, the ignorant classes believing that they bring good luck and that it is an ill omen to kill them. At the present time they are not found in Chile north of Cauquenes; formerly there were great numbers in the vicinity of the Cachapoal hence the name of the baths. The Baths of Cauquenes are situated in the Department of Caupolican in the Province of Colchagua on the south or left bank of the Cachapoal River in Latitude south and in Longitude west of Greenwich. The altitude of the place above sea level has been a matter of argument. Eight different professors claim its altitude in different figures from 200 feet which is the lowest and which is said by Domeyko to be correct, to 762 feet which is the highest and is said by Gillis to be correct. 490 feet which is the altitude claimed by Guessfelt seems to be the most exact and is the figure accepted by Dr. Louis Darapsky in his book, Mineral Waters of Chile. The season for the baths is from September 5/8th to May 1st, and in midsummer the place is generally crowded. Describing the scenery, Don Jose Victorino Lastarria, an illustrious newspaper man of Santiago, says: 'I have never seen a more impressing, and at the same time, a more charming landscape than that of the Baths of Cauquenes, nor have I ever seen in so small a space so many different kinds of views nor such surprising details. Nature has grouped there her most beautiful accidents. In sight of the snowy Andes, here rise in the foreground rounded hills covered with vegetation; there rise barren rocks through whose clefts rushes the turbulent Cachapoal. Here are gardens filled with flowers; there are impenetrable thickets. Light and shadows everywhere, colors without end, harmony and contrast which reflect or darken the rays of the sun.' The temperature is consistent and the variation during the day is neither rapid nor extreme although the mornings and evenings are cool and it is warm at midday.""","""Chilean towns, baths, and culture""","2116","""Chilean Towns, Baths, and Culture  Chile, a land of diverse landscapes and rich cultural heritage, offers a fascinating tapestry of towns, baths, and traditions that reflect its unique history and natural beauty.

"Le Plongeon Augustus","""We are also informed that He stood at the head of a trinity composed of Himself--Pacha-camac--Con--and Uiracocha. In this conception of a Supreme Being, Creator of all things, we see reflected the teachings of the Popol-vuh, Sacred book of the Quiches, in which we read, 'that all that exists is the work of Tzakol--the Creator--who by his will caused the Universe to spring into existence, and whose names are Bitol--the maker--Alom--the engenderer--Qaholom--He who gives being.' The fact that the same doctrine of a Supreme Deity composed of three parts distinct from each other, yet forming one, was universally prevalent among the civilized nations of America, Asia and the Egyptians, naturally leads to the inference that at some time or other, communications and relations more or less intimate have existed between them. They must, then, have imparted their traditions, metaphysical speculations, and intellectual attainments one to another. In fact, all historians agree with Philostratus and admit that commercial intercourse did exist between Egypt and India. Nay more, Eusebius asserts that in the reign of Memnon, king of Ethiopia, a body of Ethiopians from the countries about the Indus river migrated and settled in the valley of the Nile. And the many Chinese bottles, with inscriptions in that language, found in the tombs of Thebes, prove, beyond the least doubt, that communications have existed between the inhabitants of China and the Egyptians in times very remote, as is conjectured from the inferior quality of the bottles, that some seem to believe were manufactured before the art of making objects of porcelain reached the high degree of perfection to which it attained afterward. On the other hand, the vase with Chinese inscriptions found by Dr. Schliemann in the lowest stratum of his excavations at Hissarlik, inscriptions that were partly deciphered by the eminent indianist Mr. Emile Burnouf and afterward thoroughly interpreted by the great Chinese scholar Fi-Fangpao, when ambassador at Berlin, and proved to mention the fact of the vase having contained samples of Chinese gauze, shows that active commercial intercourse was carried on by the Chinese with Greece and Asia Minor even before the siege of Troy. These conceptions concerning the Triune God have come down through the vista of ages, to the present day, preserved in the works of the philosophers, and are still held sacred by many among Christians and Brahmins. But we do not learn from their sacred books where, when or how said doctrine originated. Whatever may have been the source from which it sprang, it is certain that the priests and learned men of Egypt, Chaldea, India, or China, if they still knew the true history of its origin at the time they wrote, kept it a profound secret, and imparted it only to a few select among those initiated in the sacred mysteries. We need not seek for information among the fathers of the Christian Church, for they are as silent as the tomb on the subject. They admitted into their tenets the notion of a Triune God as taught by the pagan philosophers, and appropriated it, as they have many other of their teachings and theories, without knowing, without inquiring, concerning their origin. The councils pronounced them revelations from on high; unfathomable mysteries not to be investigated; and imposed them as dogmas, to be implicitly believed, with blind faith, as they are to-day, by the followers of the Romish Church. Through their adherents the idea of the three persons in the Godhead has found its way into Free Masonry, and on the columns that adorn the temple, in the working of one of the degrees, we read these inscriptions: 'In the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity;' and further down, 'We have the happiness to dwell in the pacific unity of the sacred numbers.' To those initiated to the lesser mysteries the doctrine was presented under the garb of the complicated metaphysical speculations with which it has reached us. Such explanations of the symbolical nature of the mystic numbers were given to them so as to make it well-nigh impossible to obtain a fair understanding of their purport. By the perusal of the extracts just quoted it is easy to see that all the reasonings concerning the mystic value of number and its relations to a Supreme Deity are mere fancies of the imagination, vague speculations, fallacious cavils; meaningless for practical and inquiring minds. So far as explaining the nature of the Deity all philosophers agree in admitting that it transcends the intelligence of man since man is finite; and what is finite will never be able to comprehend that which is infinite. Some of the Greek philosophers reflected in their teachings, as well as in their writings, the doctrines they had learned from their teachers, the priests of Heliopolis, Memphis and Thebes. From them we may gather a glimmer of dim light pointing toward the origin of the symbolization of the numbers. We have said that Proclus asserts that the three component parts of the triple deity were three intellects or three Kings--a fact corroborated by Plato, who also had been admitted to the mysteries, and by Orpheus, who celebrated these three Kings, in the ceremonies instituted by him, that Herodotus says were identical with the Egyptian mysteries. Pythagoras, who had received his knowledge of the numbers and their meaning from the Egyptians, taught his disciples that God was number and harmony. He caused them to honor numbers and geometrical diagrams with the names of the gods. The Egyptians likened nature to the equilateral triangle, the most perfect and beautiful of all triangles; and according to Servius, assigned the perfect number to the great God. The Chaldees symbolized the Eusoph or great light, by an equilateral triangle; and in the Sri-Santara or cosmogonical diagram of the Hindoos, which has served as model for many of their temples, the nameless, the great Aum that dwells in the infinite, is figured as an equilateral triangle. The Egyptians held the equilateral triangle as the symbol of 'Nature' beautiful and fruitful. In the hieroglyphs it was the emblem of worship. We see, over the main altar, in all the ancient Catholic churches, the representation of an equilateral triangle containing the all-seeing eye of Osiris, as symbol of Deity. The same emblem is familiar also to those who visit masonic lodges as one under which is figured the 'Great Architect of the Universe.' If from those countries that we have been accustomed to consider as the 'Old World,' and guided by the three words of dismissal used by the Brahmins, and the officiating priests of Eleusis, at the closing of their religious ceremonies, words we have shown to belong to the Maya language, we carry our inquiries into the 'Lands of the West,' there again we will find that the triangle was also symbolical among the Mayas and their neighbors. We see it in the position of the three semispheres carved, as already said, at each end of the northern chamber of the building above the sanctuary at Uxmal. We next meet with it in the triangular arches that form the ceilings of the apartments in all the temples and palaces, in fact in all the edifices of Mayax, as well as in those of Palenque and other localities of Central America. The general plan of these edifices is the same everywhere; not because they were built by the same architects, or at the same period, but because their construction was in accordance with certain teachings pertaining to the mysteries. In all the buildings, whatever their size, the ground plan was in the shape of an oblong square, that is of their letter M, pronounced Ma. Ma is the contraction of Mam, the ancestor, as they denominated the Earth, and by extension the Universe. Ma is also the radical of Ma-yax, the name of the Yucatecan peninsula, in ancient times, whose shape, no doubt, suggested that of the letter M, both to the Mayas and to the Egyptians. In fact, in Egypt and in Mayax, the figure in the hieroglyphs, stands for Earth and Universe. It will be noticed by examining their plans, that this was also the shape of the apartments in the temples and palaces of Chaldea, of Egypt and Greece; that of the tombs of the Etruscans; hence, no doubt, was assigned to the masonic lodges in our days. The triangular ceiling in those countries, and there is no reason for doubting that it was the same in the 'Lands of the West,' was symbolical of the Triune God, the Ruling Spirit of the Universe, supposed to reside in the heavens, above all things. (This accounts for the constellations of the firmament being represented on the ceilings). According to Zoroaster, He is the fire, the sun, the light; that the later Platonists have described as power, intellect, soul, or spirit; and the ancient theologians, who invoked the sun in their mysteries, according to Macrobius, as power of the world, light of the world, spirit of the world; that Plutarch gives as intelligence, matter, kosmos, beauty, order, the world; of these three he says, 'universal nature may be considered to be made up, and there is reason to conclude that the Egyptians were wont to liken this nature to what they called the most beautiful and perfect triangle.' It will be noticed that the geometrical figure formed at the ends of each of these apartments, by the lines of the ceilings, sides, and floor, is a pentagon, symbol of the mystic number whose name, penta, in Greek also conveys the idea of Universe; whilst Ho in Maya, meaning, is also the radical of Hool, the head, hence the Deity.""","""Triune God and ancient traditions""","2070","""The concept of the Triune God, also known as the Holy Trinity, has been a central tenet of Christian belief since ancient times. This doctrine expresses the belief in one God existing in three distinct persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. The Triune God is a complex and mysterious aspect of Christian theology that has been a subject of much discussion, debate, and contemplation throughout history.  In the early centuries of Christianity, the doctrine of the Trinity was a point of contention that led to the convening of various ecumenical councils to clarify and define the nature of God. One of the most important of these councils was the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, which established the Nicene Creed affirming the divinity of Jesus Christ and his equality with God the Father. This creed laid the foundation for the orthodox understanding of the Trinity as one God in three persons.  The Trinitarian doctrine emphasizes the unity of God while recognizing the distinctiveness of the three persons. The Father is seen as the creator and sustainer of the universe, the Son as the savior and redeemer of humanity, and the Holy Spirit as the one who empowers and sanctifies believers. Together, they form a unity of essence and purpose, working in harmony to bring about the salvation and restoration of creation.  The Triune God is a mystery that transcends human comprehension and language. Many theologians throughout history have used analogies and metaphors to try to explain the Trinity, such as the three-leaf clover or the sun with its light and heat. While these analogies can help to some extent in understanding the concept, they ultimately fall short in capturing the fullness of the mystery of the Triune God.  In Christian worship and liturgy, the Trinitarian formula is often invoked, with prayers and hymns addressing God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The sign of the cross, made by touching the forehead, chest, and shoulders, is a physical expression of belief in the Triune God and is a common practice in many Christian traditions.  The Triune God is not just a theoretical concept but is believed to have practical implications for the life of believers. The Father's love, the Son's sacrifice, and the Spirit's guidance are seen as essential aspects of the Christian faith that inform beliefs, practices, and ethics. The Triune God is viewed as a relational and dynamic God who invites believers into a loving and transformative relationship.  In ancient Christian traditions, the doctrine of the Triune God was central to the development of theology and spirituality. Early Christian theologians such as Tertullian, Augustine, and Athanasius played key roles in articulating and defending the Trinitarian doctrine against various heresies and misunderstandings.  The Eastern Orthodox Church has a rich tradition of Trinitarian theology, emphasizing the importance of the Trinity in the spiritual life of believers. Icons depicting the Trinity as three angelic figures seated at a table symbolize the eternal communion and love shared by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  In the Western Christian tradition, particularly in Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, the Triune God is a foundational belief that shapes theology, liturgy, and devotional practices. The Nicene Creed, recited in churches around the world, affirms the Trinitarian nature of God and serves as a statement of faith for many Christians.  As Christianity spread throughout the world, diverse cultures and traditions influenced the understanding and expression of the Triune God. In African and Latin American contexts, for example, the Triune God is often invoked in prayers and rituals that reflect the particular cultural and spiritual sensibilities of these regions.  Overall, the doctrine of the Triune God has been a central and enduring belief in Christianity since its earliest days. While the mystery of the Trinity may never be fully grasped by human minds, it continues to inspire awe, wonder, and devotion among believers who seek to know and experience the divine mystery of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.""","815"
"Tret iakov Nikolaĭ Aleksandrovich","""They wisely decided not to repeat their rash attacks of the past, and contented themselves with remaining in the positions they had occupied. Thus everything was fairly peaceful, and I availed myself fully of this interval of quiet, feeling that it was safe to leave the staff headquarters occasionally. First of all, I went to see Colonel Grigorenko, but, being unable to find his house, I went on to the commandants. There I met Colonel Khvostov, who had just arrived with a report. We had a long talk about the situation, and I carried away with me the impression that no disaster was threatening us for some time to come. It seemed that, in the event of the capture of Fort Erh-lung, the commandant had a second line of defence, which we could hope to hold against the enemy for a considerable time. One would have thought that the rocky ground would have prevented the enemy from mining beneath Forts Erh-lung and Sung-shu, but nevertheless by now they were making rapid progress there. We could not make a very stubborn resistance at these points because we had no miners, and, consequently, no system of counter-mining. The counterscarp galleries were merely blocked with stones and cement, which became so solid that it would have taken about three days to destroy, as proved to be the case at Fort Chi-kuan. Some time before this, General Kondratenko had asked me to come and make an investigation. One went with Colonel Grigorenko to Fort Erh-lung, where I found General Kondratenko in the counterscarp gallery. After listening attentively to the Japanese working on the other side, we came to the conclusion that they were tunnelling in three separate parts of the outside wall of the gallery. They evidently wished to make breaches in this wall by exploding several small charges, and thus get through into the gallery. As we could only offer a passive resistance, we determined to block the gallery with a large boulder and cement it hard against those portions of the wall where the Japanese was working. This plan was carried into effect at once. All this took place some time before, and the enemy were now right under the breastwork of the fort and ready to explode several charges. In anticipation of this the fort was evacuated except for sentries on the parapets. Imagine the frame of mind of a sentry who knows that at any moment he may be blown to atoms! The commandant, having made arrangements for further resistance in case of the destruction of the fort and subsequent Japanese attack, was quietly awaiting events. Having breakfasted with the commandant, and heard a full account of the state of our defences, I returned to the headquarters of the regiment. The Japanese were directing a somewhat heavy fire towards the road along the shore, but the shells mostly fell into the water beyond. On December 8 I again rode into the town. While crossing the bridge over the Lun-ho, I felt the earth tremble slightly and then heard a loud rumble in the distance. Looking up, I saw a huge column of black smoke hanging over Fort Erh-lung. Well, I thought to myself, the fort is blown up, and possibly taken, but there is not much harm done, as the Chinese Wall is behind it. When I reached the staff, all the details were known. It turned out that the explosion had not been entirely successful, as we were still masters of the retrenchment, but we had lost heavily owing to the rain of shells into the fort. Rumour said that the Japanese themselves had suffered heavy losses from the explosion, that the whole of the trench nearest the fort had been wrecked, and that the men of the attacking party, who were waiting in it, had perished in the ruins. In my section everything was quiet, and we spent the evening quite happily, congratulating ourselves that the Japanese had not broken down the defence of the fort, which they could have done if they had exploded their 5/80-lb. pyroxylin charges under the parapets. But our joy was premature. The following day we learnt that Fort Ehr-lung had been evacuated in the night; all materiel, cartridges, and shells had been removed beforehand. Besides the fort, we had also abandoned that part of the Chinese Wall which ran straight to the rear from both flanks, and had occupied a position on a rocky crest-line behind, and on a height to the left of it. Our perilous situation in the centre of the line, the deadly artillery fire, the constantly repeated attacks, and the endless vigil wore out our men, and their spirits began to flag in a marked degree. In a great battle, soldiers may make a stubborn fight, especially if victory may yet be snatched or some great prize won for the Fatherland. But if after constant fighting there is no apparent gain; if they are, each moment, exposed to deadly peril; if from each individual heroic effort is demanded, not for one soul-stirring moment alone, but ceaselessly, with certain death the only reward, it is pardonable if hearts grow faint, if men are at times found wanting in energy and slow to carry out orders. Then is the time for reliefs; but for us there were none available. Scurvy, moreover, claimed its victims, bringing in its train suffering and weakness. Nourishing diet was necessary, and I do not know why we spared the artillery horses. Long ago we had lost all hope of any offensive action, so ere this the gun horses might well have furnished the men with meat once a day. They may perhaps have been utilized in other ways, though the fact remains that by this means we might have kept, fit and well in the trenches, more than another thousand men! On December 0 we were dining peacefully, when suddenly tremendous firing burst forth from all our batteries, and the rattle of musketry along the front told us that the Japanese were making a determined attack. We all rushed up on to the hill, but nothing was visible save the smoke from our own batteries and from bursting shrapnel. All our forts were smothered with shell, though we could not see the enemys infantry. I tried to get some news through the telephone, but it was already overtaxed and continuously in use. Only in the evening did we learn that the Japanese had made a fierce attack on the Chinese Wall and Naval Ridge beyond. This attack had been repulsed with enormous loss to the enemy, who had, however, succeeded in fortifying themselves at the foot of Naval Ridge, and thus enfiladed the Chinese Wall. Still, even that was not of supreme importance, since the Chinese Wall had a number of traverses and splinter-proofs along it. In my section all was quiet. We had not a single man in reserve, but even so we believed we could beat back every attack. This was not the case, however, on Lao-tieh Shan, where Major Romanovski had practically only our mounted Scout Detachments. The enemy constantly attacked them, and captured another hill near Pigeon Bay. This was decidedly serious, as now the Japanese had nothing but these scouts between them and the other half of the western front, where there was but a remnant of the 7th Regiment, the main portion of it being required on the front attacked, which was held by only a few men. Fortunately, the Japanese seemed content with the success already gained, and settled down for their usual long rest, or, possibly, their men were also required on the front of attack. On December 1, after tea, we received news of a further disaster. Yet once again in this disastrous war had fortune favoured the Japanese. Fort Sung-shu had been blown up, and, what was worse, in one stroke the whole garrison had been annihilated. This is what had happened: About a thousand hand grenades had been stored in an excavation which the garrison also used as a shelter. A Japanese shell burst, detonating these grenades, and the whole place collapsed on the garrison. This was a fearful blow to us, and we deeply lamented the death of our gallant comrades and their commandant. Fate had indeed played us a sorry trick! We were all dispirited, and few cared to partake of dinner that night. On the evening of the 1st we evacuated the Chinese Wall and took up positions at Wang-tai and on the Mitrofanievski, Vladimirski, and Laperovski Hills. It now became very difficult for us to hold out on the front exposed to attack. We ought to have begun fortifying the New Town on the side facing the Old Town, but no orders were received to that effect. What were our commanders doing? That night we were all very depressed. Every one discussed plans for continuing the defence, if only till the new year. This was the universal wish, and could certainly have been realized. We dispersed at a late hour, to be aroused in the morning by heavy firing. On climbing the hill, we saw Wang-tai literally swept with shell, and so covered with smoke that it was impossible to see its summit. The bombardment continued for a long time. We could not follow exactly what was taking place, but learnt in the evening that the Japanese had captured it. Our reserves had at first quickly driven back the enemy, afterwards repulsing five further attacks, but towards evening, when there were only three or four of the defenders left, the sixth assault was successful. That evening, by General Focks order, the whole of our front from Wang-tai to Chi-kuan Battery was evacuated. The same night the Japanese attacked Signal Hill, near Takhe Bay, but were repulsed. On January, 905/8, the majority of the officers were collected at the staff headquarters to hear the latest reports.""","""Military Defense and Siege Tactics""","2037","""Military defense and siege tactics have played a pivotal role throughout history, shaping the outcomes of conflicts and wars. Understanding these strategies is crucial for military leaders to defend against enemy attacks and conduct successful sieges. In this comprehensive exploration, we will delve into various aspects of military defense and siege tactics, including their historical significance, principles, key strategies, and modern applications.  The concept of military defense dates back to ancient civilizations, where fortified structures such as walls, moats, and towers were built to protect cities and territories from invading forces. These defensive structures were essential in providing a line of defense against enemy attacks, allowing defenders to withstand sieges and maintain control over strategic locations. The practice of military defense evolved over time, with advancements in technology leading to the development of more sophisticated fortifications and defensive mechanisms.  Siege tactics, on the other hand, are strategies employed by attacking forces to overcome the defenses of a fortified position or city. Sieges have been a common method of warfare throughout history, often lasting for months or even years as attackers sought to breach the defenses of their opponents. Successful sieges required careful planning, patience, and a combination of military tactics to weaken the enemy's defenses and force them to surrender.  One of the key principles of military defense is the concept of defense in depth, which involves creating multiple layers of defense to slow down and disrupt enemy advances. This strategy relies on a combination of natural obstacles, such as rivers or mountains, and man-made fortifications to create a formidable defense system. By forcing attackers to contend with multiple obstacles and defensive positions, defenders can buy time to reinforce weak points and mount a coordinated counterattack.  Fortifications play a crucial role in military defense, providing defenders with a secure base of operations from which to repel enemy attacks. Fortresses, castles, and fortified cities are designed to withstand prolonged sieges, with high walls, towers, and gates designed to protect defenders and impede enemy advances. The layout of fortifications is carefully planned to provide overlapping fields of fire, allowing defenders to cover each other and repel attacks from multiple directions.  In addition to physical fortifications, military defense also encompasses the use of tactics such as camouflage, deception, and intelligence gathering to outmaneuver and outwit the enemy. By concealing troop movements, spreading disinformation, and gathering intelligence on enemy positions and intentions, defenders can gain a strategic advantage and surprise their opponents.  On the other side of the coin, siege tactics involve a combination of military maneuvers designed to weaken enemy defenses and ultimately force a surrender. Blockades, bombardments, and mining operations are common siege tactics used to isolate defenders, destroy fortifications, and create openings for attackers to breach enemy lines. Psychological warfare, such as propaganda, threats, and intimidation, is also employed to demoralize defenders and undermine their will to resist.  Modern military defense and siege tactics have evolved significantly with the advent of advanced technologies such as artillery, aircraft, and electronic warfare systems. Defenders now have access to sophisticated surveillance equipment, long-range precision weapons, and cyber defenses to protect against a wide range of threats. Similarly, attackers leverage drones, precision-guided munitions, and information warfare to conduct more precise and effective sieges.  In conclusion, military defense and siege tactics are integral components of warfare, influencing the outcomes of conflicts and shaping the course of history. By understanding the principles, strategies, and historical significance of these concepts, military leaders can effectively defend against enemy attacks and conduct successful sieges. Through a combination of fortifications, tactics, and technological innovations, defenders can secure strategic advantages and overcome even the most determined adversaries.""","727"
"Fairbanks George R  George Rainsford ","""The garrison at St. Augustine had been in great anxiety respecting their leader, and from the accounts given by those who had deserted, they had feared the total loss of the expedition. The worthy Chaplain thus describes the return of Menendez:-- 'The same day, being Monday, we saw a man coming, crying out loudly. I myself was the first to run to him for the news. He embraced me with transport, crying 'Victory! Victory! The French fort is ours.' I promised him the present which the bearer of good news deserves, and gave him the best in my power. 'At the hour of vespers our good General arrived, with fifty foot soldiers, very much fatigued. As soon as I learned that he was coming, I ran home and put on a new soutain, the best which I had, and a surplice, and going out with a crucifix in my hand, I went forward to receive him; and he, a gentleman and a good Christian, before entering kneeled and all his followers, and returned thanks to the Lord for the great favours which he had received. My companions and myself marched in front in procession, so that we all returned with the greatest demonstrations of joy.' When about to dispatch the two vessels in his harbor to the St John's, to cut off the French vessels he had left there, he was informed that two sails had already been seen to pass the bar, supposed to contain the French fugitives. Eight days after the capture of Fort Caroline, a fire broke out in the quarters of St. Augustine, which destroyed much treasure and provisions, and the origin of which was doubtful, whether to be ascribed to accident or design. Much dissatisfaction prevailed among the officers and soldiers, and the fire was looked upon with pleasure by some, as having a tendency to hasten their departure from a spot which offered few temptations or rewards, compared to Mexico or Peru. On the very day of Menendez's return, a Frenchman was discovered by a fishing party on Anastasia Island, who, being taken, said he was one of a party of eighteen, sent in a small vessel, some days before, to reconnoitre the Spanish position; that they had been unable to keep the sea, and had been thrown ashore, about four leagues below, at the mouth of a river; that the Indians attacked and killed three of their number, and they thereupon escaped. Menendez dispatched a captain and fifty men, to get off the vessel and capture any of the French who might be found. On their arrival at the place, they found that all the French had been killed by the Indians; but they succeeded in getting off the vessel. Menendez, feeling uneasy in reference to their encounter with the Indians, had followed on after the expedition, in company with the worthy Chaplain, to whom his promenade among the briars, vines, prickly cedars, chaparral, and prickly pears of Anastasia, seems to have been a true via dolorosa. Upon their arrival, they found a considerable body of French upon the south side of an inlet, whose fires indicated their position. The four vessels of Ribault, which had gone in pursuit of the Spaniards at St. Augustine, had been overtaken by the storm, and after keeping to sea with incredible effort, had been finally driven ashore upon the shoals of Canaveral, with but little loss of life but a total loss of every thing else; they were thus thrown on shore without shelter from the elements, famished with hunger, borne down by disappointment, and utterly dispirited and demoralized. They were consumed, also, by the most painful uncertainty. Marching to the northward along shore, they discovered a skiff, and resolved to send a small number of persons in it, to make their way by sea to Fort Caroline, to bring succor to them from there. This boat succeeded in reaching the St. John's, where they were informed, by friendly Indians, of the fate which had befallen the fort; and subsequently they fell in with a Frenchman who had escaped, who related to them the whole disaster. Upon this they concluded to seek their own safety among the friendly Indians of St. Helena, rather than to be the useless bearers of the tidings of their misfortunes to their companions in arms. There are several accounts of the sad fate which befel the followers of Ribault, the massacre of whom has been perpetuated by the memorial name given to its scene, 'the bloody river of Matanzas,' the ebb and flow of whose recurring tides for three hundred years have failed to wash out the record of blood which has associated this massacre of the Huguenots with the darkest scenes of earth's history. In consequence of the rank and number of the victims, the event produced various and somewhat contradictory accounts; but all stamped with a seal of reprobation and execration the act and the actors, without reference to creed or nationality. Challeux relates instances of cruel barbarity added to the atrocity of slaughter itself; and others, it appears, had given other versions, all in different degree pointing the finger of historic justice to mark and commemorate the crime against humanity. The Spanish historian, Barcia, aims to counteract this general condemnation, of which in his own language he says, 'These calumnies, repeated in so many quarters, have sullied the fame of the Adelantado, being exaggerated by the heretics, and consented to by the Catholics, so that even the Father Felix Briot, in his annals, says that he caused them to be killed contrary to the faith which he had given them; which is altogether a falsehood, for the Adelantado did not give his word, nor would he when asked give it, to spare their lives, although they were willing to pay him for doing so; nor in the capture of Fort Caroline did he do more than has been related; and such is the account given by Doctor Salis de las Meras, brother-in-law to Donna Maria de Salis, wife of the Adelantado, who was present, and who, relating the punishment of the heretics, and the manner in which it was accomplished, says,-- 'The Adelantado occupied himself in fortifying his settlement at St. Augustine, as well as he could, to defend it from the French fleet if they should attack it. Upon the following day some Indians came and by signs informed them that four leagues distant there were a large number of Christians, who were unable to cross an arm of the sea or strait, which is a river upon the inner side of an inlet, which they were obliged to cross in order to come to St. Augustine. The Adelantado sent thither forty soldiers about dusk, and arrived about midnight near the inlet, where he commanded a halt until morning, and leaving his soldiers concealed, he ascended a tree to see what was the state of matters. He discovered many persons on the other side of the river, and their standards; and to prevent their passing over, he directed his men to exhibit themselves towards the shore, so that it might be supposed that he had with him a large force; and when they were discovered, a French soldier swam over, and said that the persons beyond the river were Frenchmen, that they had been wrecked in a storm, but had all saved their lives. The Adelantado asked what French they were? He answered, that they were two hundred of the people under command of Jean Ribault, Viceroy and Captain General of this country for the king of the French. He asked again, if they were Catholics or Lutherans? It was replied that they were all Lutherans, of the new religion; all of which was previously well known to the Adelantado, when he encountered their fleet with his vessels; and the women and children whom he had spared when he took their fort, had also so informed him; and he had found in the fort when he took it, six trunks filled with books, well bound and gilt; all of which were of the new sect, and from which they did not say mass, but preached their Lutheran doctrines every evening; all of which books he directed to be burnt, not sparing a single one. 'The Adelantado then asked him why he had come over? He said he had been sent over by his Captain, to see what people they were. The General asked if he wished to return. He said, 'Yes, but he desired to know what people they were.' This man spoke very plainly, for he was a Gascon of San Juan de Suz. 'Then tell him,' said the Adelantado, 'that it is the Viceroy and Captain General of this country for the king, Don Philip; and that his name is Pedro Menendez, and that he is here with some of his soldiery to ascertain what people those were, for he had been informed the day before that they were there, and the hour at which they came.' 'The French soldier went over with his message, and immediately returned, saying 'that if they would pledge faith to his captain and to four other gentlemen, they would like to come and treat with him;' and they desired the loan of a boat, which the General had directed to bring some provisions to the river. The General instructed the messenger to say to his captain, 'that he might come over securely under the pledge of his word,' and then sent over for them the boat; and they crossed over. The Adelantado received them very well, with only ten of his followers; the others he directed to stay some distance off among some bushes, so that their number might appear to be greater than it was. One of the Frenchmen announced himself as captain of these people; and that in a great storm they had lost four galleons, and other vessels of the king of France, within a distance of twenty leagues of each other; and that these were the people from on board of one ship, and that they desired they would let them have a boat for this arm of the sea, and for another four leagues hence, which was at St. Augustine; that they desired to go to a fort which they held twenty leagues from there. It was the same fort which Menendez had taken. The Adelantado asked them 'if they were Catholics or Lutherans?' He replied 'that they were all of the New Religion.'""","""Spanish-French conflict in Florida""","2167","""The Spanish-French conflict in Florida during the colonial period was a complex and tumultuous chapter in the history of the region. The struggle for control over this strategic territory had significant political, economic, and social implications for both colonial powers and the indigenous peoples who inhabited the land. Understanding the dynamics of this conflict requires delving into the historical context, examining key events and battles, and evaluating the lasting impact on Florida's history and identity.  The rivalry between Spain and France in Florida dates back to the early 16th century when both powers sought to establish their presence in the New World. Spain, under the leadership of explorers like Juan Ponce de León, was the first European power to reach Florida in 1513. The Spanish were driven by a desire to expand their empire, spread Christianity, and exploit the region's resources. Meanwhile, France, led by figures such as Jean Ribault and René Goulaine de Laudonnière, also had ambitions in Florida, aiming to establish settlements, trade with indigenous peoples, and challenge Spain's dominance in the region.  One of the early flashpoints in the Spanish-French conflict in Florida was the establishment of the French colony of Fort Caroline in 1564. Located along the St. Johns River, Fort Caroline posed a direct challenge to Spanish territorial claims in the area. In response, the Spanish launched an expedition led by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés to oust the French and assert their control over Florida. The conflict culminated in the brutal massacre of the French settlers at Fort Caroline in 1565, a defining moment that underscored the fierce competition between Spain and France for dominance in the region.  The Spanish victory at Fort Caroline marked a turning point in the struggle for control over Florida. With the establishment of St. Augustine as a Spanish outpost and the construction of fortifications to protect the city, Spain solidified its hold on the territory. However, French incursions and attempts to retake Florida persisted, leading to sporadic conflicts and skirmishes between the two powers throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.  The strategic significance of Florida in the Spanish-French conflict cannot be overstated. The region's proximity to the Caribbean, its rich natural resources, and its potential as a gateway to the North American continent made it a coveted prize for both colonial powers. Control over Florida meant access to vital trade routes, alliances with indigenous tribes, and a foothold for further expansion into the New World. As a result, the Spanish-French conflict in Florida was not just a territorial dispute but a geopolitical struggle with far-reaching consequences.  One of the most notable episodes in the Spanish-French conflict in Florida was the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), also known as the French and Indian War in North America. This global conflict pitted the major European powers against each other, with Spain siding with France against Great Britain. In Florida, the war resulted in a series of battles and sieges as the British sought to capture Spanish-held territories, including St. Augustine. The British eventually emerged victorious, gaining control over Florida as part of the Treaty of Paris in 1763.  The transfer of Florida from Spain to Great Britain marked a significant shift in the balance of power in the region. The British implemented new policies and administration in the territory, which had a profound impact on the local population and the socio-political landscape of Florida. However, the British occupation was short-lived, as Spain regained control of Florida following the American Revolution in 1783 through the Treaty of Paris.  The Spanish-French conflict in Florida left a lasting imprint on the region's history and culture. The legacy of Spanish colonial rule is evident in the architecture, language, and traditions of cities like St. Augustine, the oldest continuously occupied European settlement in the United States. French influences can also be seen in place names, culinary traditions, and the cultural heritage of Florida.  In conclusion, the Spanish-French conflict in Florida was a dynamic and multifaceted struggle for power, influence, and resources in the New World. The competition between Spain and France over control of the region shaped the history of Florida, leaving a legacy of conquest, colonization, and cultural exchange. By examining the historical context, key events, and lasting impact of this conflict, we gain insight into the complexities of colonial rivalries and their enduring consequences on a region rich in history and heritage.""","889"
"Carbery Edward","""The revenue of British Guiana is chiefly derived from a tax on the produce raised in the colony, and duties levied on the imposts. Parish taxes are unknown, and the laborer is exempt from every species of taxation, unless his income amount to five hundred dollars. The militia laws were abrogated, and the colonial militia disbanded soon after the emancipation took place, so that the poor man is not compelled to contribute any portion of his time to the public service. There are Episcopalian, Presbyterian and Catholic church establishments supported at an expense to the colony of upwards of $13,00 per annum, as will appear by reference to the Royal Gazette of May th, 839, published in Georgetown, containing an official estimate of the taxes to be raised for that year. There are beside numerous Methodist and other dissenting religious teachers, supported in part by charitable societies in England, and in part by voluntary contributions in the colony. The laboring population of Georgetown and its vicinity have erected several handsome chapels at their own expense. There are numerous Sunday, infant and day schools, for the gratuitous diffusion of knowledge and moral education among the people. On most of the principal estates a school-house is erected, and a teacher provided, where the children of the laborers are entitled to receive instruction free of expense. Great attention is paid throughout the colony to the education of the rising generation. V. FOR, OF,. British Guiana possesses a superabundance of the most fertile land. The planters are wealthy, and well provided with the most complete machinery for the manufacture of sugar. The only deficiency is a lack of labor. The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few. For example,--on a coffee plantation, called Dankbaarheid, in the county of Berbice, belonging to Mr. Carbery, it was estimated by the owner and other competent persons in September last, that the crop of coffee on the trees exceeded one hundred thousand pounds weight. Of this crop, through deficiency of labor, only forty thousand pounds weight were gathered. Sixty thousand pounds of coffee on that single plantation, worth, in the British market, sixty thousand sterling shillings, or about fifteen thousand dollars, perished for lack of hands to gather it. It is the same to a greater or less extent, on every other plantation. Indeed this deficiency of labor is more peculiarly felt on the sugar estates, upon many of which it is not uncommon for ripe canes, which if manufactured would have produced the value of several thousand pounds sterling, to perish in the field for want of hands to gather it. There is indeed a great opening for industry of every kind. All sorts of mechanics are sure of steady employment at wages from one to two dollars per day, according to their skill. Seamstresses and domestics are much needed and will find full employment. Any emigrant who can command a small capital, can open a shop, or set up various kinds of business to good advantage. Georgetown, the capital, situated at the mouth of the river Demarara, is a place of about twelve thousand inhabitants, and furnishes abundant employment in all those branches of business usually carried on in a commercial town. New Amsterdam, at the mouth of the Berbice, has about four thousand inhabitants, and there are besides several villages, containing each some hundreds of inhabitants. The greatest demand however for labor is, on the plantations. Agricultural laborers are always sure of abundant employment and high wages. The labor of agriculture is of various kinds, and may be performed by any man accustomed to work, with little or no previous instruction. It consists principally in cutting up weeds with the hoe, cutting down sugar-cane, and throwing it into boats on the canals, to be transported to the sugar-house; tending the sugar boiling; packing away the sugar; boating it to market; picking and curing coffee, which is very light work; tending cattle; cutting timber; and a great variety of other labor, almost all of the simplest kind. Every laborer on a plantation has a comfortable house, with a plot of ground annexed, capable of raising a much greater quantity of provisions and poultry than the laborer can consume. For this he pays nothing. He is also provided with medical attendance, medicine, and a support at the expense of the estate, gratis, whenever he is sick. Fuel is abundant, and close at hand. It is needed only for cooking, and the laborer has but to help himself. Clothing, which in that climate is very light, may be amply provided, at one-third the expense incurred for that article in the United States. So many of the wants of the laborer are thus supplied, free of expense to him, or at a very trifling rate, that if he choose to do so, he can lay by a great part of his wages. The labor on a plantation is divided into tasks which a laborer of any activity can easily perform in four hours. The lowest rate of wages ever paid, is thirty-three and a third cents a task, and very frequently, much more is given. For cutting cane, attending in the boiling house, boating sugar, and several other kinds of labor, higher wages are always paid. The people employed in making sugar, in addition to their wages, are supplied with food at the expense of the estate. This is in addition to the laborer's house, provision ground, fuel, medical attendance, gratuitous schooling for his children, and a variety of other perquisites. The wages are paid weekly in cash. I have now before me an original journal, for the month of October, 839, of the plantation Thomas, adjoining Georgetown, owned by Mr. Carbery. This journal is a printed form, with blanks filled up in writing, containing an account for each day of the month, of the number of laborers on the estate; the number actively employed, and in what way; the number, sick, absent, or otherwise prevented from working; the work done each day; with all the articles bought, sold or shipped, and all the money paid on account of the plantation during each day in the month,--in fact a complete history of all the business of the estate for that time. Similar journals are kept on every estate by the head manager, and are transmitted monthly to the proprietor. This excellent custom was derived from the early Dutch settlers. On the plantation, Thomas, there are three hundred and twenty-five acres of canes in cultivation. It appears by the journal above referred to, that during the month of October, the number of persons employed on the estate, varied from 63 to 76, of which latter number 9 were men, 8 women, 4 boys, and girls. Of these, however, only 06, on an average, were daily at work on the estate. To these laborers there was paid during the month of October, in weekly payments, $, or an average of $, to each laborer, exclusive of house rent, provision grounds, fuel, medical attendance, and many gratuities beside. It is to be considered that this average amount of wages was earned by men, women, boys and girls, including many old people and invalids, who did but very little, and whose pay was therefore small. It therefore must be obvious that the more active and industrious of the laborers, earned from fifteen to twenty dollars, a month. This single case, which is taken at random, will serve to show how abundantly the laborer is rewarded. The laborers in this case did not probably work on an average more than five hours per day. They were employed in weeding and cutting cane, and making sugar, and a portion of them as boatmen, watchmen, and mechanics. Though they are all included under the class of agricultural laborers, only about sixty out of the hundred and six were actually at work in the fields. Many more are classed in the journal, 'as jobbing and at work about the buildings,' that is, engaged in making sugar, and in a great variety of other work necessary on such an estate. To show with what rapidity the laborers grow rich and rise in the world, I give the following extract from the Berbice Advertiser of Nov. 839. ' FACT. Some negroes on the east coast, not a dozen in all, have bought $0,00, of which they paid down $,00 last week, the remaining $,00, is to be paid this week.' 'What happiness,' the editor justly observes, 'could our colony disseminate through the human species, did but fresh importations of labor render the cultivation of the great staples compatible with the formation of black villages and towns.' It ought to be mentioned that the people who clubbed together to buy this estate had only been free since August, 838. It may be well to observe here that land in the colony is abundant and cheap; and every laborer who is industrious, and will lay by his wages, has it in his power to become a proprietor within a short period. That there is no danger of overstocking British Guiana with emigrants will appear by the following extract from an address of Mr. John Scoble, delivered at Albany Tuesday evening, Aug. st, 839. He spoke of 'British Guiana, a colony on the coast of South America, and one which some think will ere long rival in its wealth and population the State of New York. It is capable of sustaining a population of forty millions, though the actual number of the inhabitants is now only one hundred thousand.' VI. MADE TO SUCH FREE OF THE, AS MAY TO TO. Mr. Carbery arrived at Baltimore in September last. He came to the United States partly for pleasure, and partly for the benefits of a change of climate.""","""Labor and economy in British Guiana""","2019","""Labor and Economy in British Guiana  British Guiana, now known as Guyana, has a complex history shaped by labor exploitation and an economy deeply tied to plantations. The labor system in British Guiana was predominantly driven by plantation agriculture, with sugarcane being the major crop. The legacy of slavery and indentured servitude profoundly impacted the labor dynamics and economic development of the region.  During the period of slavery in British Guiana, African slaves were forcibly brought to work on sugar plantations. The harsh conditions and brutal treatment they endured were central to the economy's reliance on cheap labor. The abolition of slavery in the 19th century led to the introduction of indentured laborers from India, China, and Portugal to fill the labor gap on the plantations. This system of indentureship continued well into the 20th century, shaping the ethnic diversity and social structure of British Guiana.  The economy of British Guiana was heavily dependent on sugar production, with the sugar industry serving as the main driver of economic activity. The profitability of sugar plantations relied on the availability of cheap labor, which had a direct impact on the living standards of the laborers. The unequal distribution of wealth and power created social inequalities that persisted long after the end of indentureship.  The labor movement in British Guiana played a crucial role in advocating for the rights of workers and challenging the exploitative practices of plantation owners. Trade unions emerged as a powerful force in the fight for better working conditions, fair wages, and workers' rights. The struggle for labor rights intersected with broader movements for independence and self-determination, culminating in Guyana gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1966.  Following independence, Guyana faced significant challenges in diversifying its economy away from dependence on sugar. The country grappled with political instability, economic mismanagement, and external pressures that hindered sustainable development. Transitioning from a monocrop economy to a more diversified and inclusive economic model proved to be a formidable task.  In recent years, Guyana has experienced a shift in its economic landscape with the discovery of vast oil reserves off its coast. The oil industry presents new opportunities for economic growth and development, but also raises concerns about environmental sustainability, resource management, and social equity. The government faces the challenge of managing this newfound wealth to benefit all Guyanese people while avoiding the pitfalls of previous economic models.  In conclusion, the intertwined history of labor and economy in British Guiana reflects the broader complexities of colonialism, exploitation, and resilience. The legacy of plantation labor continues to shape contemporary challenges and opportunities in Guyana's economic development. Balancing economic growth with social equity remains a critical task for shaping a sustainable and inclusive future for the country and its people.""","554"
"Laski Harold J  Harold Joseph ","""But at the very moment when his strength seemed weakest James II died; and Louis XIV, despite written obligation, sought to comfort the last moments of his tragic exile by the falsely chivalrous recognition of the Old Pretender as the rightful English king. It was a terrible mistake. It did for William what no action of his own could ever have achieved. It suggested that England must receive its ruler at the hands of a foreign sovereign. The national pride of the people rallied to the cause for which William stood. He was king--so, at least in contrast to Louis' decision, it appeared--by their deliberate choice and the settlement of which he was the symbol would be maintained. Parliament granted to William all that his foreign policy could have demanded. His own death was only the prelude to the victories of Marlborough. Those victories seemed to seal the solution of 688. A moment came when sentiment and intrigue combined to throw in jeopardy the Act of Settlement. But Death held the stakes against the gambler's throw of Bolingbroke; and the accession of George I assured the permanence of Revolution principles. II The theorist of the Revolution is Locke; and it was his conscious effort to justify the innovations of 688. He sought, as he said, 'to establish the throne of our great Restorer, our present King William, and make good his title in the consent of the people.' In the debate which followed his argument remained unanswered, for the sufficient reason that it had the common sense of the generation on his side. Yet Locke has suffered not a little at the hands of succeeding thinkers. Though his influence upon his own time was immense; though Montesquieu owed to him the acutest of his insights; though the principles of the American Revolution are in large part an acknowledged adoption of his own; he has become one of the political classics who are taken for granted rather than read. It is a profound and regrettable error. Locke may not possess the clarity and ruthless logic of Hobbes, or the genius for compressing into a phrase the experience of a lifetime which makes Burke the first of English political thinkers. He yet stated more clearly than either the general problem of the modern State. Hobbes, after all, worked with an impossible psychology and sought no more than the prescription against disorder. Burke wrote rather a text-book for the cautious administrator than a guide for the liberal statesman. But Locke saw that the main problem of the State is the conquest of freedom and it was for its definition in terms of individual good that he above all strove. Much, doubtless, of his neglect is due to the medium in which he worked. He wrote at a time when the social contract seemed the only possible retort to the theory of Divine Right. He so emphasized the principle of consent that when contractualism came in its turn to be discarded, it was discovered that Locke suffered far more than Hobbes by the change so made. For Hobbes cared nothing for the contract so long as strong government could be shown to be implicit in the natural badness of men, while Locke assumed their goodness and made his contract essential to their opportunity for moral expression. Nor did he, like Rousseau, seize upon the organic nature of the State. To him the State was always a mere aggregate, and the convenient simplicity of majority-rule solved, for him, the vital political problems. But Rousseau was translated into the complex dialectic of Hegel and lived to become the parent of theories he would have doubtless been the first to disown. Nor was Locke aided by his philosophic outlook. Few great thinkers have so little perceived the psychological foundations of politics. What he did was rather to fasten upon the great institutional necessity of his time--the provision of channels of assent--and emphasize its importance to the exclusion of all other factors. The problem is in fact more complex; and the solution he indicated became so natural a part of the political fabric that the value of his emphasis upon its import was largely forgotten when men again took up the study of foundations. John Locke was born at Wrington in Somerset on the 9th of August, 632. His father was clerk to the county justices and acted as a captain in a cavalry regiment during the Civil War. Though he suffered heavy losses, he was able to give his son as good an education as the time afforded. Westminster under Dr. Busby may not have been the gentlest of academies, but at least it provided Locke with an admirable training in the classics. He himself, indeed, in the Thoughts on Education doubted the value of such exercises; nor does he seem to have conceived any affection for Oxford whither he proceeded in 65/82 as a junior student of Christ Church. The university was then under the Puritan control of Dr. John Owen; but not even his effort to redeem the university from its reputation for intellectual laxity rescued it from the 'wrangling and ostentation' of the peripatetic philosophy. Yet it was at Oxford that he encountered the work of Descartes which first attracted him to metaphysics. There, too, he met Pocock, the Arabic scholar, and Wallis the mathematician, who must at least have commanded his respect. In 65/89 he accepted a Senior Studentship of his college, which he retained until he was deemed politically undesirable in 684. After toying with his father's desire that he should enter the Church, he began the study of medicine. Scientific interest won for him the friendship of Boyle; and while he was administering physic to the patients of Dr. Thomas, he was making the observations recorded in Boyle's History of the Air which Locke himself edited after the death of his friend. Meanwhile accident had turned his life into far different paths. An appointment as secretary to a special ambassador opened up to him a diplomatic career; but his sturdy commonsense showed him his unfitness for such labors. After his visit to Prussia he returned to Oxford, and there, in 667, in the course of his medical work, he met Anthony Ashley, the later Lord Shaftesbury and the Ahitophel of Dryden's great satire. The two men were warmly attracted to each other, and Locke accepted an appointment as physician to Lord Ashley's household. But he was also much more than this. The tutor of Ashley's philosophic grandson, he became also his patron's confidential counsellor. In 663 he became part author of a constitutional scheme for Carolina which is noteworthy for its emphasis, thus early, upon the importance of religious toleration. In 672, when Ashley became Lord Chancellor, he became Secretary of Presentations and, until 675/8, Secretary to the Council of Trade and Foreign Plantations. Meanwhile he carried on his medical work and must have obtained some reputation in it; for he is honorably mentioned by Sydenham, in his Method of Curing Fevers (676), and had been elected to the Royal Society in 668. But his real genius lay in other directions. Locke himself has told us how a few friends began to meet at his chamber for the discussions of questions which soon passed into metaphysical enquiry; and a page from a commonplace book of 671 is the first beginning of his systematic work. Relieved of his administrative duties in 675/8, he spent the next four years in France, mainly occupied with medical observation. He returned to England in 679 to assist Lord Shaftesbury in the passionate debates upon the Exclusion Bill. Locke followed his patron into exile, remaining abroad from 683 until the Revolution. Deprived of his fellowship in 684 through the malice of Charles II, he would have been without means of support had not Shaftesbury bequeathed him a pension. As it was, he had no easy time. His extradition was demanded by James II after the Monmouth rebellion; and though he was later pardoned he refused to return to England until William of Orange had procured his freedom. A year after his return he made his appearance as a writer. The Essay Concerning Human Understanding and the Two Treatises of Government were both published in 690. Five years earlier the Letter Concerning Toleration was published in its Latin dress; and four years afterwards an English translation appeared. This last, however, perhaps on grounds of expediency, Locke never acknowledged until his will was published; for the time was not yet suited to such generous speculations. Locke was thus in his fifty-eighth year when his first admitted work appeared. But the rough attempts at the essay date from 671, and hints towards the Letter on Toleration can be found in fragments of various dates between the twenty-eighth and thirty-fifth years of his life. Of the Two Treatises the first seems to have been written between 680 and 685/8, the second in the last year of his Dutch exile. The remaining fourteen years of Locke's life were passed in semi-retirement in East Anglia. Though he held public office, first as Commissioner of Appeals, and later of Trade, for twelve years, he could not stand the pressure of London writers, and his public work was only intermittent. His counsel, nevertheless, was highly valued; and he seems to have won no small confidence from William in diplomatic matters. Somers and Charles Montagu held him in high respect, and he had the warm friendship of Sir Isaac Newton. He published some short discussions on economic matters, and in 695/8 gave valuable assistance in the destruction of the censorship of the press. Two years earlier he had published his Thoughts on Education, in which the observant reader may find the germ of most of Emile's ideas.""","""John Locke and Political Philosophy""","1971","""John Locke was a prominent English philosopher who is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the development of political philosophy. His ideas laid the foundation for modern democratic governance and individual rights. Locke's works, particularly his """"Two Treatises of Government"""" published in 1689, had a profound impact on political thought and played a crucial role in shaping the Enlightenment era and the social contract theory.  Born in 1632 in Wrington, Somerset, England, Locke's early life was marked by the political upheavals of the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution. These events deeply influenced his beliefs about the nature of government, liberty, and the relationship between rulers and the ruled. Locke's philosophy emphasized the concept of natural rights, asserting that individuals are entitled to certain inherent rights that cannot be taken away by any government or authority. These rights include life, liberty, and property, which he believed were essential to human flourishing and happiness.  Central to Locke's political philosophy is the idea of the social contract. According to Locke, individuals in a state of nature voluntarily come together to form a society and establish a government to protect their natural rights. He argued that legitimate political authority derives from the consent of the governed, and that governments exist to serve the interests of the people. Locke's emphasis on the consent of the governed and the limitations of governmental power laid the groundwork for modern liberal democracy.  Locke's theory of property is also a key aspect of his political philosophy. He believed that individuals have the right to acquire and own property through their labor and that the role of government is to protect these property rights. This idea was revolutionary in the context of his time, as it challenged the prevailing notions of divine right of kings and aristocratic privilege.  In addition to his contributions to political theory, Locke made significant contributions to epistemology and metaphysics. His empiricist approach to knowledge, outlined in his """"Essay Concerning Human Understanding,"""" posited that all knowledge is derived from experience and sensory perception. This theory had a profound impact on subsequent philosophers, including David Hume and Immanuel Kant.  Locke's ideas have had a lasting influence on political thought and have shaped the development of democratic governance around the world. His emphasis on individual rights, limited government, and the consent of the governed continues to inform political debates and policymaking in contemporary society. Locke's vision of a society based on the rule of law, property rights, and individual liberty remains a powerful ideal that continues to inspire advocates of freedom and justice.  In conclusion, John Locke's political philosophy represents a landmark in the history of political thought. His defense of individual rights, the social contract, and limited government has had a lasting impact on the development of liberal democracy. Locke's ideas continue to be studied, debated, and applied to contemporary political challenges, ensuring that his legacy as a champion of freedom and equality endures.""","580"
"Cox Edward W  Edward William ","""Like the two nerves of vision, they co-ordinate. Either can act alone for the ordinary uses of existence, just as one eye will do the usual work of sight. But as we see more perfectly, extensively, and roundly with two eyes than with one so it may be reasonably concluded that we think more truly and clearly, and feel more strongly, when the two brains act together than when one is working alone. The faculty of comparison is one of the most important of the mental powers, for it is the basis of accurate knowledge. But it is doubtful if this faculty can do its work in one brain unless co-ordinated with the same faculty in the other brain. Unlike the other mental faculties, comparison can exercise itself only upon two ideas. Its very purpose is to make us conscious of the resemblances and differences between any two ideas presented to it. All mental processes are successive that is to say, no two mental actions are performed by the same mental faculty at the same instant of time. Consequently, the faculty of comparison cannot exercise itself without having before it two ideas to contrast. As one brain can present only one idea at any one moment, one brain cannot provide the materials wherewith comparison can work. The process of comparison cannot therefore be effected without the aid of the other brain. This, in healthy waking life, is done instantly, perfectly and unconsciously, by means of the power of co-ordination possessed by the two hemispheres. Such being the action of the waking brain, does sleep present any conditions that might be explained in like manner? Suppose the state of dream to be the slumber of one hemisphere only, the other being awake. May not this solve the problem? In dream we believe shadows to be substances, ideas to be things, incongruities to be natural, and impossibilities to be realities; and so believing, we have no sense of surprise and reason is not shocked. Nothing of these results presents itself when we are awake. Why? Waking, the faculty of Comparison is enabled to do its work. It compares the idea with the reality, the shadow with the substance, the dream within with the impression without, the present picture of the mind with the stored knowledge of the past. The differences being thus discovered, the mind dismisses them as being the mere visions that they are. The mental operation is performed somewhat in this manner. Two ideas are present in the mind, which compares them and traces their resemblances and differences. The sense-borne idea being thus brought face to face, as it were, with the brain-born idea, the distinction is discovered, and the latter is relegated to the limbo of visions, the former is accepted as a reality and made the basis of action. But inasmuch as two ideas cannot be presented at the same instant of time by one brain hemisphere, the presence of the two ideas requisite to the process of comparison can be had only by the combined action of both hemispheres. Hence the usual inability of persons afflicted with hemiplegia to compare or reason accurately. If the action of the faculty of comparison were paralysed, we should dream when awake. The suspension of the action of this faculty in dream would suffice to account for the accepted incongruities of dream, without assuming the sleep of the entire hemisphere. But, as observed above, it is difficult to assume the slumber of one mental faculty alone, packed as all are among many with which they are intimately united. It is more probable that in dream the entire of one hemisphere sleeps. The facts are in accordance with such a suggestion. But, however this may be, it does not disturb the conclusion, that the seat of sleep is in the ganglia at the base of the brain. That portion of the brain which directs the motions of the body sleeps always. Sleep reigns more or less perfectly in the portions of the brain that receive the impressions of the senses. Sleep is very partial in the cerebrum, the duplex organ of the intelligence, and sleep prevails there, if at all, by the contrivance of slumber by one hemisphere while the other is awake. Such being the Physiology of Dream so far as science has yet succeeded in tracing it we proceed now to investigate its Psychology. The Functions of the Brain. By, M.D., F.R.S. London: Smith, Elder, & Co., 876. VII. THE OF. The base of the brain being quite asleep, the central ganglia being partially asleep, the cerebral hemispheres or some part of them being awake, we have the physiological condition in which occur the Phenomena of Dream. The first coming on of Dream is found at the moment of falling asleep, before actual sleep has begun. Then we are conscious for an instant that we are dreaming that the mental impressions are not external realities. But this consciousness is for a moment only. Either we start into waking life and the incipient dream is banished, or we fall into actual sleep and the condition of complete dream is established. The process is worthy of note. You are engaged in some occupation say that you are reading a novel. You feel sleepy; your eyes continue to pass over the page; your mind pictures the persons, actions and emotions of the story. But by degrees the ideas become dim and shadowy and the attention flags. Then your mind wanders away to other scenes and persons, which come into it uncalled for and even against your Will. But the power of that Will is lessening also. At first it is strong to banish the intruding thoughts; but as the attention relaxes more and more, so more and more does your Will cease to control the now thick-coming fancies. In that incipient stage of dream you know that these dream-pictures are only dreams. Never do you mistake them for realities. Soon the influence of sleep steals over the mind. The eyelids close and exclude the impressions of the external world that are made through the sense of sight. The other senses are paralyzed also. The creations of the brain take full possession of the mind. You are now asleep and dreaming. If the condition of dream were not so familiar if it did not occur to all of us, but only to some few persons in abnormal conditions, it would appear to the whole world as very wonderful. Suppose that dreaming were a faculty possessed only by persons of a certain constitution; that a Dreamer had told you how, when he was asleep, he saw and conversed with the dead, beheld distant places, lived another life, walked upon water, flew through the air, performed impossibilities, felt passions and sentiments and exercised intellectual powers far exceeding those of his waking life, should we not say of him that he was a madman or an impostor? Would he not be prosecuted by the high priests of physical science as a rogue and vagabond, and sent to prison by the Scientists or to an asylum by the Doctors? But because all of us do these things nightly the wonder of them does not strike us. We do not pause to think how great the marvel is, nor how it comes to be. May I venture to hope that the reader will be induced to look upon this marvellous mental phenomenon with some curiosity and hereafter to recognise in the phenomena of dream, not only something to awaken curiosity, but something to command his serious attention, as being peculiarly fitted to reveal to the inquirer some of the mysteries of Mind, its structure, its faculties, the manner of its action. The phenomena of Dream open to us the path by which we may hope to make the first advances into the science of Psychology, for they are facts known to all, disputed by none and which even the Materialists cannot deny. Happily, neither their vocabulary of abuse, nor their weapons of prosecution and persecution, can be directed against those who investigate the phenomena of dream. Their existence cannot be denied, nor can they be explained by attributing them to imposture. How comes this transformation from sanity to insanity, wrought in a moment, when Sleep has closed upon the Mind the portals of the senses and left it almost isolated from the real material external world to revel in its own imaginary world? Some rein that held the mind in check when awake has certainly been taken from it at the instant sleep occurs. What is that lost rein that paralyzed power? It is not Consciousness. We do not lose our individuality in dream. Never does the dreamer suppose himself to be another person. He may dream that he has assumed other characters, that he is a king, or a beggar, but still it is himself who has become a king and is acting king. Nor is the Will absent. The dreaming mind is conscious of the exercise of its Will and believes that its commands are obeyed. But the Will is powerless to compel action. Its commands are not obeyed. In dream we will to speak, to run, to do what the body does freely when in our waking state we will to do. We will in dream as we will when awake, but the mechanism of the nerves that move the body refuses to obey the mandate of the Will however strenuously exerted. Imagination, on the other hand, is even more lively in dream than in our waking time. The Reasoning Faculties are not asleep, for we argue, often rightly only we reason upon wrong premisses. We accept the visions of the mind the ideas presented to the Conscious Self as being real and then we reason upon them rationally. What Lawyer has not often dreamed that he was addressing a logical legal argument to an approving Court and, when wakened, remembering and reviewing that argument, has found it to be without a flaw? The Emotions are not extinguished when we dream. The presentation of imaginary incidents which, if they had been real, would have kindled the passions in waking life, rouse those self-same passions to equal if not to greater fury in dream. Nor is the passion fanciful.""","""Brain Function and Dream Psychology""","2031","""The brain is an extraordinary organ responsible for controlling all our thoughts, emotions, perceptions, and actions. Its intricate network of neurons enables us to think, reason, create, and dream. Understanding brain function and its role in dream psychology offers insights into the fascinating realm of human consciousness and behavior.  Brain function is a complex process involving various regions, each with distinct functions contributing to our cognitive abilities. The cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain, is integral to higher brain functions such as thinking, memory, perception, and language. It is divided into four lobes—the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes—each playing a unique role in processing information.  The frontal lobe, located at the front of the brain, is associated with decision-making, problem-solving, and emotional control. This region helps us plan, organize, and execute tasks, regulating our behavior and personality. Damage to the frontal lobe can lead to changes in personality, impulse control issues, and difficulties with social interactions.  The parietal lobe, positioned behind the frontal lobe, processes sensory information like touch, pain, and spatial awareness. It helps us navigate our surroundings, orient ourselves in space, and interpret sensory input to understand the world around us. Damage to the parietal lobe can result in difficulties with spatial awareness, hand-eye coordination, and sensory integration.  The temporal lobe, located on the sides of the brain, is involved in memory formation, language comprehension, and emotional responses. This region processes auditory information, facilitates learning and memory consolidation, and plays a crucial role in recognizing faces and objects. Damage to the temporal lobe can impair memory, speech comprehension, and emotional regulation.  The occipital lobe, situated at the back of the brain, is responsible for visual processing and interpreting what we see. It receives visual input from the eyes and helps us perceive colors, shapes, and movement. Damage to the occipital lobe can result in visual disturbances, such as difficulty recognizing objects or faces, and may cause visual hallucinations.  The intricate interplay between these lobes and other brain regions facilitates complex cognitive functions, including the phenomenon of dreaming. Dreaming occurs during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep when brain activity resembles that of wakefulness. This stage is characterized by vivid dreams, heightened brain activity, and muscle paralysis to prevent acting out dreams.  Dream psychology delves into the significance of dreams and their potential meanings. Sigmund Freud, a pioneer in dream interpretation, believed that dreams were a window into the unconscious mind, revealing hidden desires, fears, and unresolved conflicts. Freud's psychoanalytic theory suggested that dreams symbolize repressed thoughts and emotions, offering insights into the dreamer's psyche.  Carl Jung, another influential figure in dream psychology, proposed a more holistic view of dreams, emphasizing their symbolic and archetypal nature. Jung believed that dreams reflect universal themes and symbols shared across cultures, tapping into the collective unconscious—a reservoir of shared human experiences and symbols.  Contemporary research continues to explore the science behind dreaming, investigating its neural correlates and potential functions. Some theories suggest that dreaming serves a cognitive or emotional processing function, helping consolidate memories, regulate emotions, or simulate real-life scenarios to prepare us for future challenges.  Neuroimaging studies have shed light on the brain regions involved in dreaming, highlighting the role of the limbic system, hippocampus, and amygdala in emotional processing during dreams. These areas contribute to the vivid emotional experiences often associated with dreams, creating a rich tapestry of sensations and narratives while we sleep.  Dreams can vary in content, from mundane everyday experiences to bizarre fantastical scenarios, reflecting the diversity of human imagination and subconscious processes. Some dreams may be fleeting and easily forgotten, while others leave a lasting impression, prompting introspection and analysis of their possible meanings.  Lucid dreaming, a phenomenon where individuals are aware they are dreaming and can sometimes control their dream content, adds another layer of complexity to dream psychology. Studying lucid dreaming can offer insights into consciousness, self-awareness, and the boundaries between waking life and the dream world.  As our understanding of brain function and dream psychology continues to evolve, we gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the human mind and the mysteries of consciousness. Exploring the inner workings of the brain and unraveling the secrets of dreams not only enrich our understanding of ourselves but also provide a fascinating glimpse into the depths of human experience.""","901"
"Prichard H A  Harold Arthur ","""The statement, however, that we saw the buildings moving really assumes that we, the observers, were stationary; and it states too much. What we really perceived was a relative changing of position between us, the near buildings, and the distant trees. This is a fact, and the apprehension of it, therefore, does not afterwards prove mistaken. It is equally compatible with motion on the part of the trees, or of the buildings, or of the observers, or of a combination of them; and that for which an appeal to causality is needed is the problem of deciding which of these alternatives is correct. Moreover, the perceived relative change of position is objective; it concerns the things apprehended. Hence, in this case too, it can be said that we perceive an objective succession from the beginning, and that the appeal to causality is only needed to determine something further about it. It is useless to urge that to be aware of an event is to be aware of it in all its definiteness, and that this awareness admittedly involves an appeal to causality; for it is easy to see that unless our awareness of the relative motion formed the starting-point of any subsequent process in which we appealed to the law of causality, we could never use the law to determine which body really moved.' Two remarks may be made in conclusion. In the first place, the basis of Kant's account, viz. the view that in our apprehension of the world we advance from the apprehension of a succession of perceptions to the apprehension of objects perceived, involves a. As Kant himself in effect urges in the Refutation of Idealism, self-consciousness, in the sense of the consciousness of the successive process in which we apprehend the world, is plainly only attained by reflecting upon our apprehension of the world. We first apprehend the world and only by subsequent reflection become aware of our activity in apprehending it. Even if consciousness of the world must lead to, and so is in a sense inseparable from, self-consciousness, it is none the less its presupposition. Cf. p. 20. In the second place, it seems that the true vindication of causality, like that of the first analogy, lies in the dogmatic method which Kant rejects. It consists in insight into the fact that it is of the very nature of a physical event to be an element in a process of change undergone by a system of substances in space, this process being through and through necessary in the sense that any the outcome of certain preceding A and B are in the relation of influence, and also of interaction or reciprocal influence, in the sense that they one another's states. Again, if we first perceive A in the state by a perception A, then B in the state by a perception B, then A in the state by a perception A and so on, we can a reciprocal sequence of perceptions, in the sense of a sequence of perceptions in which alternately a perception of B follows a perception of A and a perception of A follows a perception of B; for first a perception of B, viz. B, follows a perception of A, viz. A, and then a perception of A, viz. A, follows a perception of B, viz. B.""","""Perception and Causality in Motion""","660","""Perception and causality are fundamental concepts that intertwine when it comes to understanding motion. Our perception of motion is shaped by various factors, including our senses, cognition, and past experiences. Causality, on the other hand, deals with the relationship between cause and effect, attempting to explain why things happen the way they do. When examining motion through the lens of perception and causality, we can unravel the complexities behind how we perceive and interpret movement in the world around us.  In terms of perception, our brains play a crucial role in processing the sensory information received from our environment. When we observe an object in motion, our visual system captures the movement and relays this information to the brain for interpretation. However, our perception of motion is not solely reliant on our visual input; other sensory modalities such as auditory and proprioceptive cues also contribute to our overall perception of movement. These multisensory inputs are integrated in the brain to create a cohesive representation of motion, allowing us to navigate and interact with our surroundings effectively.  Moreover, our past experiences and expectations significantly influence how we perceive motion. For instance, if we see a ball rolling down a slope, our previous encounters with similar situations enable us to predict its trajectory and anticipate its future path. This predictive ability is grounded in our understanding of causality – the notion that every event has a cause that precedes it. By drawing upon past experiences and knowledge of physical laws, we can infer the causes behind observed motions and make accurate predictions about future outcomes.  Causality, in the context of motion, provides a framework for explaining why objects move the way they do. Newton's laws of motion, for example, describe the relationship between an object's forces and its resulting motion. The first law states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force, highlighting the cause-and-effect relationship between force and motion. This law helps us understand the inertia of objects and how they respond to changes in their environment.  Furthermore, causality in motion extends to the concept of momentum, which describes how the motion of an object is influenced by its mass and velocity. Momentum is a product of both an object's inertia (mass) and its motion (velocity), showcasing the interconnectedness between causality and physical movement. By considering momentum, we can explain phenomena such as collisions, where the transfer of momentum from one object to another dictates the resulting motion of the system.  In conclusion, perception and causality are essential components in understanding motion. Our perception of motion is shaped by sensory inputs, past experiences, and cognitive processes, providing us with a rich understanding of the dynamic world around us. Meanwhile, causality elucidates the underlying reasons for why objects move as they do, offering a predictive framework to explain and analyze motion patterns. By intertwining perception and causality, we gain a deeper insight into the complexities of motion and how we make sense of the dynamic behaviors unfolding in our environment.""","595"
"Bassnett Thomas 1808 ","""If in an infinite space of imponderable fluid a vortex is generated, the central parts are rarefied, and the exterior parts are unchanged. But in all finite vortices there must be a limit, outside of which the motion is null, or perhaps contrary. In this case there may be a cylindrical ring, where the medium will be somewhat denser than outside. Just as in water, every little vortex is surrounded by a circular wave, visible by reflection. As the density of the planet Neptune appears, from present indications, to be a little denser than Uranus, and Uranus is denser than Saturn, we may conceive that there is such a wave in the solar vortex, near which rides this last magnificent planet, whose ring would thus be an appropriate emblem of the peculiar position occupied by Saturn. This may be the case, although the probability is, that the density of Saturn is much greater than it appears, as we shall presently explain. In order to show that there is nothing extravagant in the supposition of the density of the ether being directly as the square roots of the distances from the axis, we will take a fluid whose law of density is known, and calculate the effect of the centrifugal force, considered as a compressing power. Let us assume our atmosphere to be 7 miles high, and the compressing power of the earth's gravity to be 89 times greater than the centrifugal force of the equator, and the periodic time of rotation necessary to give a centrifugal force at the equator equal to the gravitating force to be 3 minutes. Now, considering the gravitating force to be uniform, from the surface of the earth upwards, and knowing from observation that at 8,00 feet above the surface, the density of the air is only 1/2, it follows, (in accordance with the principle that the density is as the compressing force,) that at 31/2 miles high, or 8,00 feet below the surface of the atmosphere, the density is only part of the density at the surface of the earth. Let us take this density as being near the limit of expansion, and conceive a hollow tube, reaching from the sun to the orbit of Neptune, and that this end of the tube is closed, and the end at the sun communicates with an inexhaustible reservoir of such an attenuated gas as composes the upper-layer of our atmosphere; and further, that the tube is infinitely strong to resist pressure, without offering resistance to the passage of the air within the tube; then we say, that, if the air within the tube be continually acted on by a force equal to the mean centrifugal force of the solar vortex, reckoning from the sun to the orbit of Neptune, the density of the air at that extremity of the tube, would be greater than the density of a fluid formed by the compression of the ocean into one single drop. For the centrifugal force of the vortex at,00,00 miles from the centre of the sun, is equal to gravity at the surface of the earth, and taking the mean centrifugal force of the whole vortex as one-millionth of this last force; so that at,00,00 miles from the surface of the sun, the density of the air in the be double the density of the attenuated air in the reservoir. And the air at the extremity of the tube reaching to the orbit of Neptune, would be as much denser than the air we breathe, as a number expressed by 73 with 39 ciphers annexed, is greater than unity. This is on the supposition of infinite compressibility. Now, in the solar vortex there is no physical barrier to oppose the passage of the ether from the centre to the circumference, and the density of the ethereal ocean must be considered uniform, except in the interior of the stellar vortices, where it will be rarefied; and the rarefaction will depend on the centrifugal force and the length of the axis of the vortex. If this axis be very long, and the centrifugal velocity very great, the polar influx will not be sufficient, and the central parts will be rarefied. We see, therefore, no reason why the density of the ether may not be three times greater at Saturn than at the earth, or as the square roots of the distances directly. ' LAW OF. Thus, in the solar vortex, there will be two polar currents meeting at the sun, and thence being deflected at right angles, in planes parallel to the central plane of the vortex, and strongest in that central plane. The velocity of expansion must, therefore, diminish from the divergence of the radii, as the distances increase; but in advancing along these planes, the ether of the vortex is continually getting more dense, which operate by absorption or condensation on the radial stream; so that the velocity is still more diminished, and this in the ratio of the square roots of the distances directly. By combining these two ratios, we find that the velocity of the radial stream will be in the ses-plicate ratio of the distances inversely. But the force of this stream is not as the velocity, but as the square of the velocity. The force of the radial stream is consequently as the cubes of the distances inversely, from the axis of the vortex, reckoned in the same plane. If the ether, however, loses in velocity by the increasing density of the medium, it becomes also more dense; therefore the true force of the radial stream will be as its density and the square of its velocity, or directly as the square roots of the distances, and inversely as the cubes of the distances, or as the. power of the distances inversely. If we consider the central plane of the vortex as coincident with the plane of the ecliptic, and the planetary orbits, also, in the same plane; and had the force of the radial stream been inversely as the square of the distances, there could be no disturbance produced by the action of the radial stream. It would only counteract the gravitation of the central body by a certain amount, and would be exactly proportioned at all distances. As it is, there is an outstanding force as a disturbing force, which is in the inverse ratio of the square roots of the distances from the sun; and to this is, no doubt, owing, in part, the fact, that the planetary distances are arranged in the inverse order of their densities. Suppose two planets to have the same diameter to be placed in the same orbit, they will only be in equilibrium when their densities are equal. If their densities are unequal, the lighter planet will continually enlarge its orbit, until the force of the radial stream becomes proportional to the planets' resisting energy. This, however, is on the hypothesis that the planets are not permeable by the radial stream, which, perhaps, is more consistent with analogy than with the reality. And it is more probable that the mean atomic weight of a planet's elements tends more to fix the position of equilibrium for each. Under the law of gravity, a planet may revolve at any distance from the sun, but if we superadd a centripulsive force, whose law is not that of gravity, but yet in some inverse ratio of the distances, and this force acts only superficially, it would be possible to make up in volume what is wanted in density, and a lighter planet might thus be found occupying the position of a dense planet. So the planet Jupiter, respecting only his resisting surface, is better able to withstand the force of the radial stream at the earth than the earth itself. To understand this, it is necessary to bear in mind, that, as far as planetary matter is concerned, the earth would revolve in Jupiter's orbit in the same periodic time as Jupiter, under the law of gravity: but that, in reality, the whole of the gravitating force is not effective, and that the equilibrium of a planet is due to a nice balance of interfering forces arising from the planet's physical peculiarities. As in a refracting body, the density of the ether may be considered inversely as the refraction, and this as the atomic weight of the refracting material, so, also, in a planet, the density of the ether will be inversely in the same ratio of the density of the matter approximately. Hence, the density of the ether within the planet Jupiter is greater than that within the earth; and, on this ethereal matter, the sun has no power to restrain it in its orbit, so that the centrifugal momentum of Jupiter would be relatively greater than the centrifugal momentum of the earth, were it also in Jupiter's orbit with the same periodic time. Hence, to make an equilibrium, the earth should revolve in a medium of less density, that there may be the same proportion between the external ether, and the ether within the earth, as there is between the ether around Jupiter and the ether within; so that the centrifugal tendency of the dense ether at Jupiter shall counteract the greater momentum of the dense ether within Jupiter; or, that the lack of centrifugal momentum in the earth should be rendered equal to the centrifugal momentum of Jupiter, by the deficiency of the centrifugal momentum of the ether at the distance of the earth. If then, the diameters of all the planets were the same (supposing the ether to act only superficially), the densities would be as the distances inversely; for the force due to the radial stream is as the square roots of the distance inversely, and the force due to the momentum, if the density of the ether within a planet be inversely as the square root of a planet's distance, will also be inversely as the square roots of the distances approximately. We offer these views, however, only as suggestions to others more competent to grapple with the question, as promising a satisfactory solution of Bode's empirical formula. If there be a wave of denser ether cylindrically disposed around the vortex at the distance of Saturn, or between Saturn and Uranus, we see why the law of densities and distances is not continuous. For, if the law of density changes, it must be owing to such a ring or wave.""","""Solar Vortex Dynamics and Planetary Density""","2089","""Solar Vortex Dynamics: Solar vortex dynamics are a fascinating area of study within the realm of solar physics, focusing on the intricate patterns and behaviors of vortices that occur on the surface of the Sun. These vortices, also known as solar cyclones or solar tornadoes, are immense swirling structures composed of hot gases that manifest as dark spots on the Sun's surface. Understanding the dynamics of these vortices is crucial for gaining insights into solar activity, space weather phenomena, and their potential impact on Earth and the broader solar system.  At the heart of solar vortex dynamics lies the complex interplay of magnetic fields, plasma motion, and the Sun's differential rotation. Magnetic fields on the Sun play a fundamental role in shaping the behavior of solar vortices. The Sun's magnetic field is dynamic and constantly evolving, leading to the formation of sunspots that are often associated with solar vortices. These sunspots are regions of intense magnetic activity where the magnetic field lines become twisted and tangled, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of vortices.  Plasma motion within the Sun, driven by convective currents, also influences the dynamics of solar vortices. As hot plasma rises to the surface in regions of intense magnetic activity, it can generate swirling motions that give rise to vortices. These vortices can persist for days or even weeks, with some reaching sizes larger than the Earth itself. The interaction between plasma flows and magnetic fields results in the complex dynamics observed in solar vortices.  The differential rotation of the Sun, where different latitudes rotate at different speeds, further complicates the dynamics of solar vortices. This differential rotation can twist and distort magnetic field lines, leading to the formation of vortices that exhibit intricate and often chaotic behavior. Studying how solar vortices evolve over time and how they interact with surrounding magnetic structures is essential for advancing our understanding of solar dynamics and predicting solar activity.  Solar vortices are not merely intriguing phenomena to observe; they also have real-world implications for space weather and its impact on Earth. Solar vortices can release intense bursts of energy in the form of solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which can affect our planet's magnetosphere and ionosphere. Understanding the mechanisms behind these solar events is crucial for protecting satellites, power grids, and communication systems from the adverse effects of space weather.  In conclusion, solar vortex dynamics offer a window into the complex and dynamic nature of our nearest star. By studying the behavior of solar vortices, scientists can uncover valuable insights into solar activity, magnetic fields, and plasma physics. These studies not only deepen our understanding of the Sun but also have practical implications for predicting and mitigating the impacts of solar activity on Earth and space infrastructure.  Planetary Density: Planetary density is a fundamental property that provides valuable information about the internal composition and structure of planets. The density of a planet is defined as its mass divided by its volume and is typically expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). By comparing the density of a planet to known materials on Earth, scientists can infer what materials constitute its interior and make educated guesses about its geological history and formation processes.  The density of a planet is influenced by several factors, including its size, composition, and internal structure. Generally, smaller planets tend to have lower densities due to their lower gravitational forces compressing their materials. In contrast, larger planets can have higher densities, as the greater gravitational forces lead to more compression of materials in their cores. The composition of a planet also plays a critical role in determining its density. Planets with metallic cores, such as Earth, tend to have higher densities than those composed mainly of lighter materials like rocks and ices.  The internal structure of a planet, including its core, mantle, and crust, also impacts its overall density. Planets with a dense metallic core, like Earth's iron-nickel core, contribute significantly to their overall density. The mantle, which lies above the core and consists of silicate rocks, also affects the planet's density. Variations in composition and temperature within the mantle can result in density variations that influence the planet's overall density.  Planetary density varies widely across the solar system, with terrestrial planets like Earth and Venus having relatively high densities compared to gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. Earth's average density is around 5.5 g/cm³, while Jupiter's average density is much lower at approximately 1.3 g/cm³. These differences in density reflect the diverse formation processes and material compositions that shaped each planet during their early history.  Studying planetary density is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of planets, as well as for determining their internal structures. By measuring the density of a planet, scientists can infer its composition, differentiate between rocky and gaseous planets, and uncover clues about the conditions that existed during their formation. Planetary density measurements also help scientists classify planets based on their physical properties and place them in the context of broader planetary systems and exoplanets discovered in other star systems.  In conclusion, planetary density serves as a critical parameter for deciphering the mysteries of the cosmos and unraveling the origins of celestial bodies. By examining the density of planets within our solar system and beyond, scientists can glean valuable insights into planetary formation processes, internal dynamics, and the diversity of worlds that populate our universe. Understanding planetary density is a cornerstone of planetary science, shedding light on the fundamental forces that shape the planets we observe in the vast expanse of space.""","1113"
"O Brien George","""The question of currency was not therefore one to engage the serious attention of the writers of the time. Aquinas does not deal with money in the Summa, except incidentally, and his references to the subject in the De Regimine Principum--which occur in the chapters of that work of which the authorship is disputed--simply go to the length of approving Aristotle's opinions on money, and advising the prince to exercise moderation in the exercise of his power of coining sive in mutando sive in diminuendo pondus. As is often the case, the discussion of the rights and duties of the sovereign in connection with the currency only arose when it became necessary for the public to protest against abuses. Philip the Fair of France made it part of his policy to increase the revenue by tampering with the coinage, a policy which was continued by his successors, until it became an intolerable grievance to his subjects. In vain did the Pope thunder against Philip; in vain did the greatest poet of the age denounce 'him that doth work With his adulterate money on the Seine.' Matters continued to grow steadily worse until the middle of the fourteenth century. During the year 348 there were no less than eleven variations in the value of money in France; in 349 there were nine, in 35/81 eighteen, in 35/83 thirteen, and in 35/85/8 eighteen again. In the course of a single year the value of the silver mark sprang from four to seventeen livres, and fell back again to four. The practice of fixing the price of many necessary commodities must have aggravated the natural evil consequences of such fluctuations. This grievance had the good result of fixing the attention of scholars on the money question. 'Under the stress of facts and of necessity,' says Brants, 'thinkers applied their minds to the details of the theory of money, which was the department of economics which, thanks to events, received the earliest illumination. Lawyers, bankers, money-changers, doctors of theology, and publicists of every kind, attached a thoroughly justifiable importance to the question of money. We are no doubt far from knowing all the treatises which saw the light in the fourteenth century upon this weighty question; but we know enough to affirm that the monetary doctrine was very developed and very far-seeing.' Buridan analysed the different functions and utilities of money, and explained the different ways in which its value might be changed. He did not, however, proceed to discuss the much more important question as to when the sovereign was entitled to make these alterations. This was reserved for Nicholas Oresme, who published his famous treatise about the year 373. The merits of this work have excited the unanimous admiration of all who have studied it. Roscher says that it contains 'a theory of money, elaborated in the fourteenth century, which remains perfectly correct to-day, under the test of the principles applied in the nineteenth century, and that with a brevity, a precision, a clarity, and a simplicity of language which is a striking proof of the superior genius of its author.' According to Brants, 'the treatise of Oresme is one of the first to be devoted ex professo to an economic subject, and it expresses many ideas which are very just, more just than those which held the field for a long period after him, under the name of mercantilism, and more just than those which allowed of the reduction of money as if it were nothing more than a counter of exchange.' 'Oresme's treatise on money,' says Macleod, 'may be justly said to stand at the head of modern economic literature. This treatise laid the foundations of monetary science, which are now accepted by all sound economists.' 'Oresme's completely secular and naturalistic method of treating one of the most important problems of political economy,' says Espinas, 'is a signal of the approaching end of the Middle Ages and the dawn of the Renaissance.' Dr. Cunningham adds his tribute of praise: 'The conceptions of national wealth and national power were ruling ideas in economic matters for several centuries, and Oresme appears to be the earliest of the economic writers by whom they were explicitly adopted as the very basis of his argument. A large number of points of economic doctrine in regard to coinage are discussed with much judgment and clearness.' Endemann alone is inclined to quarrel with the pre-eminence of Oresme; but on this question, he is in a minority of one. The principal question which Oresme sets out to answer, according to the first chapter of this treatise, is whether the sovereign has the right to alter the value of the money in circulation at his pleasure, and for his own benefit. He begins the discussion by going over the same ground as Aristotle in demonstrating the origin and utility of money, and then proceeds to discuss the most suitable materials which can be made to serve as money. He decides in favour of gold and silver, and shows himself an unquestioning bimetallist. He further admits the necessity of some token money of small denominations, to be composed of the baser metals. Having drawn attention to the transition from the circulation of money, the value of which is recognised solely by weight, to the circulation of that which is accepted for its imprint or superscription, the author insists that the production of such an imprinted coinage is essentially a matter for the sovereign authority in the State. Oresme now comes to the central point of his thesis. Although, he says, the prince has undoubtedly the power to manufacture and control the coinage, he is by no means the owner of it after it has passed into circulation, because money is a thing which in its essence was invented and introduced in the interests of society as a whole. Oresme then proceeds to apply this central principle to the solution of the question which he sets himself to answer, and concludes that, as money is essentially a thing which exists for the public benefit, it must not be tampered with, nor varied in value, except in cases of absolute necessity, and in the presence of an uncontroverted general utility. He bases his opposition to unnecessary monetary variation on the perfectly sound ground that such variation is productive of loss either to those who are bound to make or bound to receive fixed sums in payment of obligations. The author then goes on to analyse the various kinds of variation, which he says are five--figurae, proportionis, appellationis, ponderis, and materiae. Changes of only justified when it is found that the existing form is liable to increase the damage which the coins suffer from the wear and tear of usage, or when the existing currency has been degraded by widespread illegal coining; changes proportionis are only allowable when the relative value of the different metals constituting the coinage have themselves changed; simple changes of pronounced by Oresme to be just as gross a fraud as the arbitrary alteration of the weights or measures by which corn or wine are sold; and changes of only to be tolerated when the supply of the old metal has become insufficient. The debasement of the coinage by the introduction of a cheaper alloy is condemned. In conclusion, Oresme insists that no alteration of any of the above kinds can be justified at the mere injunction of the prince; it must be accomplished per ipsam communitatem. The prince exercises the functions of the community in the matter of coinage not as principalis actor, but as ordinationis publicae executor. It is pointed out that arbitrary changes in the value of money are really equivalent to a particularly noxious form of taxation; that they seriously disorganise commerce and impoverish many merchants; and that the bad coinage drives the good out of circulation. This last observation is of special interest in a fourteenth-century writer, as it shows that Gresham's Law, which is usually credited to a sixteenth-century English economist, was perfectly well understood in the Middle Ages. This brief account of the ground which Oresme covered, and the conclusions at which he arrived, will enable us to appreciate his importance. Although his clear elucidation of the principles which govern the questions of money was not powerful enough to check the financial abuses of the sovereigns of the later Middle Ages, they exercised a profound influence on the thought of the period, and were accepted by all the theologians of the fifteenth century. IV We have now passed in review the principal economic doctrines of the medival schoolmen.""","""Economic Doctrines and Monetary Theory""","1748","""Economic Doctrines and Monetary Theory play pivotal roles in shaping the economic policies and frameworks of nations worldwide. These doctrines and theories serve as guiding principles for governments, central banks, and policymakers to navigate complex economic landscapes, manage monetary systems, and promote overall financial stability. Throughout history, various economic ideologies and theories have emerged, each offering unique perspectives on how economies function and how to address economic challenges. Let's delve into some key economic doctrines and monetary theories that have significantly influenced economic thought and policy.  One prominent economic doctrine is classical economics, which traces its roots back to Adam Smith's seminal work, """"The Wealth of Nations."""" Classical economists believe in the power of free markets, emphasizing the role of supply and demand in determining prices and resource allocation. They advocate for minimal government intervention in the economy and argue that individuals pursuing their self-interest can lead to optimal outcomes for society as a whole. The invisible hand concept, popularized by Smith, suggests that markets can self-regulate and promote efficiency without external interference.  In contrast to classical economics, Keynesian economics emerged in the early 20th century during the Great Depression, with John Maynard Keynes as its leading figure. Keynesian economics emphasizes the importance of aggregate demand in driving economic activity. According to this theory, government intervention, particularly through fiscal policy (government spending and taxation), can help stabilize the economy during downturns and promote full employment. Keynesian economics also highlights the role of expectations, uncertainty, and animal spirits in influencing economic behavior.  Monetary theory, closely intertwined with economic doctrines, focuses on the role of money in the economy and the tools available to central banks to influence economic activities. One crucial concept in monetary theory is the quantity theory of money, which posits a direct relationship between the supply of money and the price level in an economy. Central banks use monetary policy tools, such as open market operations and interest rate adjustments, to control the money supply, manage inflation, and stabilize the economy.  Another noteworthy monetary theory is the monetarist approach, championed by economists like Milton Friedman. Monetarists argue that changes in the money supply have a significant impact on economic outcomes, particularly on inflation rates. They advocate for a stable and predictable growth rate in the money supply to foster long-term price stability and sustainable economic growth. Monetarism gained prominence during the 1970s when high inflation rates plagued many economies, challenging traditional Keynesian approaches.  Furthermore, the Austrian School of Economics offers a unique perspective on economic doctrines, emphasizing individual choice, entrepreneurship, and the importance of market signals in resource allocation. Austrian economists, such as Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, stress the limitations of central planning and advocate for a decentralized market system driven by price signals and information processing mechanisms. Their focus on capital theory and the role of knowledge in economic coordination has influenced contemporary debates on economic planning and market efficiency.  Moreover, behavioral economics has gained traction in recent years, blending insights from psychology and economics to understand how individuals make decisions in real-world settings. Behavioral economists challenge the rationality assumptions of traditional economic models, highlighting cognitive biases, heuristics, and social influences that shape human behavior. This interdisciplinary approach offers new perspectives on consumer choices, financial decision-making, and policy design, enriching our understanding of economic phenomena beyond traditional frameworks.  In conclusion, economic doctrines and monetary theories form the bedrock of economic thought, providing frameworks for understanding economic phenomena, guiding policy decisions, and addressing economic challenges. From classical economics to Keynesianism, monetarism, the Austrian School, and behavioral economics, each doctrine and theory offers unique insights into the workings of economies and the implications for policymaking. By studying and critically evaluating these diverse perspectives, economists and policymakers can develop more nuanced approaches to address the ever-evolving economic landscape and promote sustainable and inclusive growth.""","765"
"Bose Jagadis Chandra","""The employment of the large Palm was obviously impracticable in these investigations. I, therefore, searched for other plant-organs in which the movement under variation of temperature was similar to that of the Date Palm. I found that the horizontally spread leaves of vigorous specimens of Arenga saccharifera growing in a flower pot executed movements which were practically the same as that of the Faridpur tree. The leaf moved downwards with rise of temperature and vice versa. There are many practical advantages in working with a small specimen. It can easily be placed under glass cover or taken to a glass house, thus completely eliminating the troublesome disturbance caused by the wind. Diurnal movement in continued darkness: Experiment.--The plant was placed in a dark room and records taken continuously for three days. These did not differ in any way from the normal records taken in a glass house under daily variation of light and darkness. Exposure of plant to darkness for the very prolonged period of a week or more, undoubtedly interferes with the healthy photo-tonic condition of the plant. But such unhealthy condition did not make its appearance in the first few days. OF THE. There may be a misgiving that the movement of the tree might be due to physical effect of temperature. If the upper strip of a differential thermometer be made of the more expansible brass and the lower of iron, the compound strip bends down with the rise of temperature. Similarly the movement of the tree might be due to the upper half being physically more expansible. It would have been possible to discriminate the physical from the physiological action by causing the death of the tree; in that case physical movement would have persisted, while the physiological action would have disappeared. As this test was not practicable, I tried the effect of physiological depression on the periodic movement of the leaf of Arenga saccharifera. Effect of Drought: Experiment.--In Fig. is given a series of records of movement of the leaf-stalk of Arenga, first under normal condition, afterwards under increasing drought, brought about by withholding water. The uppermost is the thermographic record which remained practically the same for successive days. Below this are records of movement of the normal condition, after withholding water for three days, deprivation for seven days. It will be noticed how the extent of movement is diminished under increasing physiological depression brought on by drought. On the seventh day, the responsive movement disappeared, there being now a mere fall of the leaf, which was slow and continuous. After this I supplied the plant with water and the periodic movement was in consequence nearly restored to its original vigour. Effect of poison: Experiment.--In another experiment the normal diurnal record with the leaf was taken and the plant was afterwards killed by application of poisonous solution of potassium cyanide. The diurnal movement was found permanently abolished at the death of the plant. These experiments conclusively prove that the periodic movement of the leaf-stalk induced by variation of temperature is a physiological phenomenon, and from analogy we are justified in drawing the inference that the movement of the Faridpur tree is also physiological. The question, however, was finally settled by the unfortunate death of the tree which occurred the other day, nearly a year after I commenced my investigations. While presiding at my lecture on the subject, His Excellency Lord Ronaldshay, the Governor of Bengal, announced that a telegram had just reached him from his officer at Faridpur that the palm tree was dead, and that its movements had ceased. Since my investigation with the Faridpur Praying Palm, I have received information regarding other Palms, which exhibit movements equally striking. One of the trees is growing by the side of a tank, the trunk of the tree being inclined towards it. The up-lifted leaves of this tree are swung round in the afternoon and dipped into the water of the tank. The movement of the tree has been shown to be brought about by the physiological action of temperature variation; in other words the diurnal movement of the Praying Palm is a. I have found various creeping stems, branches and leaves of many trees, exhibit this particular movement of fall with a rise of temperature, and vice versa. Such movements, I shall, for the sake of convenience, distinguish as belonging to the negative type. Having found that the temperature is the modifying cause, the next point of inquiry relates to the discovery of the force, whose varying effects under changing temperature induces the periodic movement. I shall, in this connection, first discuss the various tentative theories that may be advanced in explanation of the movement. AND. It may be thought that the fall of the tree during rise of temperature may be due to passive yielding of the tree to its weight, there being increased transpiration and general loss of turgor at high temperature. I shall, however, show that the diurnal movement persists in the absence of transpiration. Diurnal movement in absence of transpiration: Experiment.--In the leaf of Arenga saccharifera, I found that the petiole was the organ of movement. I cut off the transpiring lamina and covered the cut end with collodion flexile. The plant was now placed in a chamber saturated with moisture. The petiole continued to give records of its diurnal movement in every way similar to the record of the intact leaf. In another experiment with the water plant, Ipoemia reptans, immersed in water, the normal diurnal movement was given by the plant, where there could be no question of variation of turgor due to transpiration. (See also Expt..) In the diurnal movement of the Praying Palm the concave curvature of the rigid neck in the morning, became flattened or slightly convex in the afternoon. The force necessary to cause this is enormously great, and could on no account result from the passive yielding to the weight of the upper part of the tree. From the facts given above it will be seen that the diurnal movement is not brought about by variation in transpiration. I now turn to another phenomenon which appeared at first to have some connection with the movement of the tree. Kraus found that the tissue tensions of a shoot exhibit a daily periodicity. He, however, found that between 0 C. and 0 C., variation of temperature had no effect on the daily period. But as regards the diurnal movement of the tree, it is the temperature which is the principal factor. Kraus also found a daily variation of bulk in different plant-organs; this variation of bulk is connected with transpiration, for the removal of the transpiring leaves arrested this variation. But the periodic movement of the tree, as we have seen, is independent of transpiration. Millardet observed a daily periodicity of tension in Mimosa pudica. He found that maximum tension occurs before dawn; the petiole becomes erected, the movement being upwards or towards the tip of the stem. Tension decreases during the day, and reaches a minimum early in the evening; in correspondence with this is the fall of the petiole, the movement being away from the tip of the stem. If the plant were placed upside down the periodic movement of the petiole in relation to the stem will evidently remain the same, but become reversed in space. Maximum tension in the morning will make the petiole approach the tip of the stem, i.e., the movement will be downwards instead of upwards as in the normal position. The experiment described below will show that the diurnal movement induced by variation of temperature is not reversed by placing the plant in an inverted position. Vines.--Physiology of Plants, 886, pp. 05/8 and 43. Diurnal movement in inverted position: Experiment.--I took a vigorous specimen of Arenga saccharifera growing in a pot, and took its normal record, which as explained before exhibited down-movement during rise, and an up-movement during fall of temperature. The plant was now held inverted, the upper side of the petiole now facing the earth. The diurnal curve of movement should now show an inversion, if that movement was solely determined by the anisotropy of the organ. But the record did not exhibit any such inversion. After being placed upside down, the leaf did not, on the first day, show any diurnal movement; there was, on the other hand, a continuous down-movement on account of the fall of the leaf by its own weight. But in the course of 4 hours the leaf readjusted itself to its unaccustomed position, and became somewhat erected under the action of geotropic stimulus. After the attainment of this new state of geotropic equilibrium, the leaf gave a very pronounced record of its diurnal movement which did not show any reversal; the inverted leaf continued to exhibit the same characteristic movements as in the normal position, that is to say, a down movement during rise, and an up-movement during fall of temperature. As the plant in the inverted position did not show any reversal of the periodic curve, it is clear that the diurnal movement is determined by the modifying influence of temperature on the physiological reaction of the plant to some external stimulus which is constant in direction. I shall presently show that it is the constant geotropic stimulus modified by the action of temperature, which determines the diurnal movement of the tree.""","""Plant Movement and Physiology""","1891","""Plants, the green inhabitants of our planet, exhibit a fascinating array of movements and physiological processes that are vital for their growth, survival, and reproduction. From the subtle swaying of leaves in the wind to the complex mechanisms of nutrient uptake, plants are dynamic organisms that respond to environmental cues in remarkable ways. Understanding plant movement and physiology not only sheds light on their intricate biology but also offers insights into their adaptive strategies in diverse ecosystems.  One of the most well-known plant movements is phototropism, the growth response of plants towards light. This phenomenon is orchestrated by the plant hormone auxin, which accumulates on the shaded side of the plant, causing cells to elongate and the plant to bend towards the light source. Phototropism ensures that plants can optimize their light exposure for photosynthesis, a crucial process where they convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth.  Another notable movement displayed by plants is gravitropism, also known as geotropism, where plants respond to gravity by growing either towards or away from its pull. Root gravitropism ensures that roots grow downward into the soil, facilitating water and nutrient uptake, while shoot gravitropism results in upward growth to reach sunlight for photosynthesis. These responses are mediated by specialized cells containing organelles called statoliths, which sense gravity and signal the plant to grow in the appropriate direction.  In addition to these growth movements, plants also exhibit nastic movements, which are reversible responses to stimuli such as touch, temperature, and humidity. One well-known example is thigmotropism, where plants like vines and tendrils wrap around supports for stability and climbing. Additionally, nyctinasty refers to the daily rhythmic opening and closing of flowers and leaves in response to light and temperature changes, a mechanism that influences pollination and energy conservation.  Apart from movements, plant physiology encompasses a wide range of processes that are essential for their survival. One critical aspect is water uptake and transport, facilitated by specialized tissues called xylem and phloem. Xylem transports water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant, while phloem distributes sugars produced during photosynthesis to nourish different plant parts. The cohesion-tension theory explains how water is pulled up through the plant, relying on the cohesive properties of water molecules and the tension created by transpiration.  Photosynthesis is another fundamental physiological process that sustains plant life. In the presence of sunlight, plants use chlorophyll to capture light energy, which is then converted into chemical energy to produce glucose and oxygen. This process not only fuels plant growth but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, making it vital for both plant and animal life on Earth.  Furthermore, plant hormones play a crucial role in regulating growth, development, and responses to environmental cues. Auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene are among the key hormones that control various aspects of plant physiology, such as cell elongation, seed germination, fruit ripening, and stress responses. These hormones interact in intricate ways to coordinate plant growth and adaptability to changing conditions.  In the context of plant defense mechanisms, plants have evolved sophisticated ways to protect themselves from herbivores, pathogens, and environmental stressors. They produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, tannins, and terpenoids, that deter herbivores and pathogens or attract beneficial organisms for defense. Additionally, plants can initiate systemic acquired resistance and induced defense responses upon pathogen attack, priming themselves for future challenges.  Moreover, environmental factors like light intensity, temperature, humidity, and nutrient availability profoundly influence plant physiology. For instance, high light intensity can lead to photoinhibition, where excessive light damages the photosynthetic machinery, prompting plants to employ protective mechanisms like non-photochemical quenching to dissipate excess energy. Similarly, nutrient deficiencies or toxicities can disrupt physiological processes and impair plant growth, emphasizing the importance of balanced nutrition for plant health.  In conclusion, plant movement and physiology are integral components of plant biology that showcase the remarkable adaptability and complexity of these organisms. Understanding how plants respond to various stimuli, coordinate growth and development, and interact with their environment is not only scientifically intriguing but also essential for sustainable agriculture, ecosystem conservation, and biotechnological applications. By unraveling the mysteries of plant movement and physiology, we gain a deeper appreciation for the green beings that play a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth.""","909"
"Maurice C Edmund Charles Edmund ","""But he now found that some, who had been hitherto his followers, were prepared to resist and oppose him. Stanislaus of Znojem and Stephen Palec had been released from their imprisonment at Bologna, at the request of Wenceslaus; and since their return to Prague they had gradually drifted into the ranks of the opponents of reform. Stanislaus had been the first to show this change. The charge of heresy on which he had been arrested had been based on a pamphlet dealing with Wyclifs doctrines. He pleaded that the apparent Wyclifite tendency of the pamphlet was due to its incompleteness; and, when ordered to finish it, he did so in a sense hostile to the doctrines of Wyclif. It will be remembered that, though Hus had repudiated many of the doctrines of the English Reformer, he had yet opposed the general condemnation of his works, and had spoken warmly of his character. Therefore Stanislaus attack upon Wyclif paved the way for an open opposition to Hus. Palec, indeed, had remained on the side of his old leader during the struggle with Zbynek, but the opposition to the Papal Bull drove him also into the orthodox ranks. The cry of cowardice has been raised against him by the friends of Hus, and seems, indeed, to have been sanctioned by Hus himself. But, unscrupulous and malignant as Palec afterwards showed himself, it may be doubted whether the charge of cowardice was, in this instance, a just one. It must be remembered that in his previous opposition to Popes, Hus had protected himself by the well-recognised formula that the Pope had been misinformed on the condition of affairs in Bohemia. On this occasion the question at issue was not so much one of information about special facts as of clear moral principles; and the issue of the Bull took away all possibility of throwing the blame of the Popes action on misleading advisers. Moreover, the opposition of Hus was no longer covered by the authority of the King. Wenceslaus, having once committed himself to opposition to Gregory, was not disposed to inquire too curiously into the methods which were used to suppress the fallen Pope. He had therefore sanctioned Johns Bull, and thereby approved the crusade. It may well, therefore, have been that Palec, though willing to resist the ordinary current of clerical opinion, might yet doubt the lawfulness and propriety of setting himself against his spiritual and temporal rulers. At any rate, when Hus brought before the Masters of the University his proposal to denounce the crusade and its methods, Palec and Stanislaus headed the opposition to their former leader, and won the majority of the Masters to their side. But Hus was not to be silenced. He continued to preach and write against the sale of indulgences; and he proposed to hold a discussion on the Papal Bull in the Carolinum, a college founded for the clergy by Charles IV. He was now compelled into a position which seems to anticipate the more advanced Reformers of the following century; for when the new Archbishop, Albik, called on him to obey the Apostolic commands, he answered that the Apostolic commands were those contained in the teaching of Christ and His Apostles; that, so far as the Popes commands agreed with them, he would obey them gladly; but that, if they did not agree with them, he would not obey them, if the fire were kindled in his presence. Hus was now at issue with old friends, with the leaders of learning, and with the rulers of Church and State. It was therefore with special satisfaction that he must have hailed a new supporter who came to his aid at this crisis. This was a young Bohemian nobleman, named Hieronymus, or Jerom. He has often been credited with the first introduction of Wyclifs works into Bohemia, though some historians have thrown doubt on this claim. Whether it were so or not, he certainly now formed a link between the reforming leaders and the fashionable world, which did not previously exist. His easy circumstances and noble birth gave him entrance to the Court circles of Europe; and his attractive manners, splendid dress, and love of display gained him fame and popularity. Moreover, he had found great delight in exciting discussions on doubtful points of theology in the various Universities which he had visited. He began these discussions at Heidelberg, apparently against the wish of the University authorities. He had visited Oxford, whither a reputation for heresy had preceded him; and he had specially provoked the opposition of Gerson, the Chancellor of the Paris University, by the controversies which he had inaugurated in that famous centre of learning. He now plunged boldly into the dispute about the sale of indulgences. His brilliant and polished oratory threw into shade for the time the simpler eloquence of Hus. He was followed home, on one occasion, by a large crowd of students; and the reforming movement began to attract the sympathies of the younger nobles. But it soon became evident that the new converts would bring more zeal than dignity to the camp of the reformers. The forms of ridicule of the clerical party indulged in by these fiery spirits can scarcely have been welcome to the soberer reformers who had been first drawn to the teaching of Hus. Thus, for instance, a procession was organised, which marched through the streets of Prague, and in which the chief figure was a student, who was dressed as a woman of ill-fame, wearing round her neck an imitation of the Papal Bulls. Such demonstrations as these, when accompanied by satirical songs, naturally led to disorder and riot. Wenceslaus, who was divided in feeling between his friendliness to Hus and his desire to enforce his own decrees, tried in vain to effect a compromise between the contending parties, and, finding reconciliation or even partial restraint impossible, he forbad the reformers to offer any further opposition to the sale of indulgences. This decree at once called out the sterner and nobler side of the reforming spirit. In spite of the kings prohibition, three young men came to the church where the champions of the indulgences were preaching, and made a public protest against the preachers words. The intruders were promptly secured by the officials of the town council, and were at once taken to the Great Ring. A large crowd gathered to see what was intended, and Hus came forward to remind the councillors that he was the first promoter of the opposition to the indulgences, and that they ought therefore to punish him before they punished these young men. The Councillors gave an answer which seemed to imply that the prisoners should not be injured; but no sooner had the crowd dispersed than the youths were taken into a side street and summarily executed. Great excitement followed this treachery; and numbers of people paraded the streets declaring their readiness to die for the truth. Hus, from his pulpit, praised the young men who had been executed, and exhorted his hearers to stand by the truth. Another opponent now came forward to give new impulse to the attacks on Hus. This was a German priest of questionable antecedents, called Michael de Causis. He drew up a list of articles against the reformer, which revived, more definitely, the charge of sympathising with Wyclifs doctrine, both as to the Sacraments, and the interference of secular authorities with the property of the clergy. With these charges Michael now combined the accusation of stirring up the people against the bishops, and making ill-feeling in the University. Pope John, already indignant at the opposition to his Bull, was roused by these charges to more decided action. He excommunicated Hus, and laid an Interdict on Prague. Several Germans tried to give practical force to this sentence by rushing armed into the Bethlehem chapel, and attempting to kill Hus; but his friends rallied round him, and the assassins were forced to retire. During all this time Wenceslaus seems to have shown towards Hus a forbearance such as he hardly ever exhibited towards others who crossed his path. Doubtless one must trace in this conduct the influence of the queen; but, to whatever cause it was due, it did not fail to affect the feelings of Hus. He was shocked at the amount of disorder and bitterness prevailing in Prague; and he was grieved to think that he was, to some extent, the cause of it. The desire for peace and concession which these considerations produced was naturally quickened by personal gratitude to the King; and he now consented to leave Prague for a time, and to retire to Austi, where he remained under the protection of a powerful noble. It was during this retirement that he composed the book De Ecclesia, which was to cost him so dear. In this he declared, more distinctly than before, his disbelief in the necessity of the Pope and Cardinals as a part of the constitution of the Church, and his belief in the essential equality of all Orders of the clergy. But his retirement from Prague brought no cessation to the fierceness of the controversy. Jakaubek of Kladrau, who now took the lead among the friends of Hus, demanded a reformation of the lives of the clergy, and declared that no peace could be made till these were amended. Wenceslaus once more stepped in as peacemaker. He appointed a commission of four, to which the representatives of the opposite parties were to present their different statements for consideration and arbitration. Stanislaus and his friends drew up an address, in which they spoke of the Church, whose head is the Pope, and whose body is the Cardinals. For this Jakaubek and his friends proposed to substitute the words, whose head is Jesus Christ our Saviour, and His representative is the Pope.""","""Hus and early Church reform""","2014","""In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Czech priest Jan Hus emerged as a prominent figure in the movement for church reform. Born in Bohemia around 1369, Hus was deeply influenced by the ideas of John Wycliffe, an English theologian who criticized the wealth and corruption of the Catholic Church. Hus advocated for reforms that sought to address these issues and restore a simpler, more authentic form of Christianity based on the teachings of the Bible.  One of the key areas of contention for Hus was the issue of indulgences. Indulgences were certificates sold by the church that purported to reduce the punishment for sins and shorten one's time in Purgatory. Hus believed that the sale of indulgences was corrupt and exploited the faithful for financial gain. He argued that true repentance and faith in God were the only means of obtaining forgiveness for sins, rather than relying on the purchase of indulgences.  Hus also criticized the immorality and opulence of the clergy, particularly the higher-ranking officials within the church. He believed that the clergy should lead lives of humility and piety, in line with the teachings of Jesus Christ. Hus's outspoken criticism of the church's hierarchy and practices made him a controversial figure, drawing both supporters and opponents to his cause.  Despite facing resistance from the church, Hus continued to preach his message of reform to the people of Bohemia. He gained a following among the Czech population, who were drawn to his emphasis on personal piety and adherence to the Scriptures. However, Hus's growing influence and popularity posed a threat to the church's authority, leading to his eventual excommunication by the Council of Constance in 1415.  Hus was summoned to the Council of Constance to defend his teachings, where he was promised safe conduct. Despite this assurance, he was ultimately arrested, tried for heresy, and sentenced to death by burning at the stake in 1415. Hus's martyrdom sparked outrage in Bohemia and fueled the Hussite Wars, a series of conflicts between Hussites and the Catholic Church that lasted for several decades.  The ideas and legacy of Jan Hus had a profound impact on the Protestant Reformation that would follow in the 16th century. Figures such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and others drew inspiration from Hus's teachings and actions, further challenging the authority and practices of the Catholic Church. Hus's emphasis on the authority of the Bible, the priesthood of all believers, and the need for church reform laid the groundwork for the transformation of Christianity in the centuries to come.  In conclusion, Jan Hus's fearless advocacy for church reform and his willingness to challenge the established authority of the Catholic Church marked him as a key figure in the pre-Reformation period. Through his teachings and ultimately his sacrifice, Hus left a lasting impact on the course of Christian history, paving the way for future reformers to continue his work of seeking a more authentic and faithful expression of the Christian faith.""","597"
"Flandrau Charles E  Charles Eugene ","""War was raging between the Hudson Bay people and the Northwest Company, in which Governor Semple, chief governor of the factories and territories of the Hudson Bay Company was killed. Selkirk proceeded to Fort William, on Lake Superior, and finally reached his settlement on the Red river. The colonists were compelled to pass the winter of 817 in hunting in Minnesota, and had a hard time of it, but in the spring they once more found their way home, and planted crops, but they were destroyed by grasshoppers, which remained during the next year and ate up every growing thing, rendering it necessary that the colonists should again resort to the buffalo for subsistence. During the winter of 819-0 a deputation of these Scotchmen came all the way to Prairie du Chien on snowshoes for seed wheat, a distance of a thousand miles, and on the fifteenth day of April, 820, left for the colony in three Mackinaw boats, carrying three hundred bushels of wheat, one hundred bushels of oats, and thirty bushels of peas. Being stopped by ice in Lake Pepin, they planted a May pole and celebrated May day on the ice. They reached home by way of the Minnesota river, with a short portage to Lake Traverse, the boats being moved on rollers, and thence down the Red River to Pembina, where they arrived in safety on the third day of June. This trip cost Lord Selkirk about six thousand dollars. Nothing daunted by the terrible sufferings of his colonists, and the immense expense attendant upon his enterprise, in 820 he engaged Capt. R. May, who was a citizen of Berne, in Switzerland, but in the British service, to visit Switzerland and get recruits for his colony. The captain made the most exaggerated representations of the advantages to be gained by emigrating to the colony, and induced many Swiss to leave their happy and peaceful homes to try their fortunes in the distant, dangerous and inhospitable regions of Lake Winnipeg. They knew nothing of the hardships in store for them, and were the least adapted to encounter them of any people in the world, as they were mechanics, whose business had been the delicate work of making watches and clocks. They arrived in 821, and from year to year, after undergoing hardships that might have appalled the hardiest pioneer, their spirits drooped, they pined for home, and left for the south. At one time a party of two hundred and forty-three of them departed for the United States, and found homes at different points on the banks of the Mississippi. Before the eastern wave of immigration had ascended above Prairie du Chien, many Swiss had opened farms at and near St. Paul, and became the first actual settlers of the country. Mr. Stevens, in an address on the early history of Hennepin county, says that they were driven from their homes in 836 and 837 by the military at Fort Snelling, and is very severe on the autocratic conduct of the officers of the fort, saying that the commanding officers were lords of the North, and the subordinates were princes. I have no doubt they did not underrate their authority, but I think Mr. Stevens must refer to the removals that were made of settlers on the military reservation of which I have before spoken. The subject of the Selkirk colony cannot fail to interest the reader, as it was the first attempt to introduce into the great Northwest settlers for the purposes of peaceful agriculture, everybody else who had preceded them having been connected with the half-savage business of the Indian trade; and the reason I have dwelt so long upon the subject is, because these people, on their second emigration, furnished Minnesota with her first settlers, and curiously enough, they came from the north. Abraham Perry was one of these Swiss refugees from the Selkirk settlement. With his wife and two children, he first settled at Fort Snelling, then at St. Paul, and finally at Lake Johanna. His son Charles, who came with him, has, while I am writing, on the twenty-ninth day of July, 899, just celebrated his golden wedding at the old homestead, at Lake Johanna, where they have ever since lived. They were married by the Right Reverend A. Ravoux, who is still living in St. Paul. Charles Perry is the only survivor of that ill-fated band of Selkirkers.. In 835/8 George Catlin, an artist of merit, visited Minnesota, and made many sketches and portraits of Indians. His published statements after his departure about his adventures elicited much adverse criticism from the old settlers.. Featherstonehaugh, an Englishman, about the same time, under the direction of the United States government, made a slight geological survey of the Minnesota valley, and on his return to England he wrote a book which reflected unjustly upon the gentlemen he met in Minnesota; but not much was thought of it, because until recently such has been the English custom. AND THE OF THE. In 832 the United States sent an embassy, composed of thirty men, under Henry R. Schoolcraft, then Indian Agent at Sault Ste. Marie, to visit the Indians of the Northwest, and, when advisable, to make treaties with them. They had a guard of soldiers, a physician, an interpreter, and the Rev. William T. Boutwell, a missionary at Leech Lake. They were supplied with a large outfit of provisions, tobacco and trinkets, which were conveyed in a bateau. They travelled in several large bark canoes. They went to Fond du Lac, thence up the St. Louis river, portaged round the falls, thence to the nearest point to Sandy lake, thence up the Mississippi to Leech lake. While there, they learned from the Indians that Cass lake, which for some time had been reputed to be the source of the Mississippi, was not the real source, and they determined to solve the problem of where the real source was to be found, and what it was. I may say here that, in 819, Gen. Lewis Cass, then governor of the Territory of Michigan, had led an exploring party to the upper waters of the Mississippi, somewhat similar to the one I am now speaking of, Mr. Henry R. Schoolcraft being one of them. When they reached what is now Cass lake, in the Mississippi river, they decided that it was the source of the great river, and it was named Cass lake, in honor of the governor, and was believed to be such source until the arrival of Schoolcraft's party in 832. After a search, an inlet was found into Cass lake, flowing from the west, and they pursued it until the lake now called 'Itasca' was reached. Five of the party, Lieutenant Allen, Schoolcraft, Dr. Houghton, Interpreter Johnson and Mr. Boutwell, explored the lake thoroughly, and finding no inlet, decided it must be the true source of the river. Mr. Schoolcraft, being desirous of giving the lake a name that would indicate its position as the true head of the river, and at the same time be euphonious in sound, endeavored to produce one, but being unable to satisfy himself, turned it over to Mr. Boutwell, who, being a good Latin scholar, wrote down two Latin words, 'veritas,' truth, and 'caput,' head, and suggested that a word might be coined out of the combination that would answer the purpose. He then cut off the last two syllables of veritas, making 'Itas,' and the first syllable of caput, making 'ca,' and, putting them together, he gave the word 'Itasca,' which, in my judgment, is a sufficiently skillful and beautiful literary feat to immortalize the inventor. Mr. Boutwell died within a few years at Stillwater, in Minnesota. Presumptuous attempts have been made to deprive Schoolcraft of the honor of having discovered the true source of the river, but their transparent absurdity has prevented their having obtained any credence, and to put a quietus on such unscrupulous pretenses, Mr. J. V. Brower, a scientific surveyor, under the auspices of the Minnesota Historical Society, has recently made exhaustive researches, surveys and maps of the region, and established beyond doubt or cavil the entire authenticity of Schoolcraft's discovery. Gen. James H. Baker, once surveyor general of the State of Minnesota, and a distinguished member of the same society, under its appointment, prepared an elaborate paper on the subject, in which is collected and presented all the facts, history and knowledge that exists relating to the discovery, and conclusively destroys all efforts to deprive Schoolcraft of his laurels. IN. While on the subject of the source of the Mississippi river, I may as well speak of the elevations of the state above the level of the sea. It can be truthfully said that Minnesota occupies the summit of the North American continent. In its most northern third rises the Mississippi, which, in its general course, flows due south to the Gulf of Mexico. In about its center division, from north to south, rises the Red River of the North, and takes a general northerly direction until it empties into Lake Winnipeg, while the St. Louis and other rivers take their rise in the same region and flow eastwardly into Lake Superior, which is the real source of the St. Lawrence, which empties into the Atlantic. The elevation at the source of the Mississippi is,00 feet, and at the point where it leaves the southern boundary of the state, 20 feet. The elevation at the source of the Red River of the North is the same as that of the Mississippi,,00 feet, and where it leaves the state at its northern boundary 67 feet. The average elevation of the state is given at,75/8 feet, its highest elevation, in the Mesaba range,,00 feet, and its lowest, at Duluth, 02 feet.. In 836 a French savant, M. Jean N. Nicollet, visited Minnesota for the purpose of exploration. He was an astronomer of note, and had received a decoration of the Legion of Honor, and had also been attached as professor to the Royal College of 'Louis Le Grande.'""","""Selkirk Colony and Early Settlement""","2136","""Located in the heart of the vast Canadian prairies, Selkirk Colony stands as a pivotal landmark in the history of early settlement and colonization. Established in the mid-19th century, Selkirk Colony emerged as a beacon of hope and opportunity for immigrants seeking a new life in the rugged terrain of western Canada. The story of Selkirk Colony is one of resilience, determination, and the enduring spirit of those who braved the unknown to forge a new future in a harsh and untamed land.  Selkirk Colony owes its origins to the vision of ambitious pioneers who sought to create a thriving agricultural community in the midst of the Canadian wilderness. Inspired by the promise of fertile soil and abundant resources, these settlers embarked on a journey that would test their courage and perseverance to the limits. Led by a sense of adventure and a desire for a better life, these early settlers faced numerous challenges as they sought to establish a foothold in this rugged and unforgiving landscape.  One of the most significant aspects of Selkirk Colony was its unique blend of cultures and backgrounds. Comprised of immigrants from various European countries, the colony was a melting pot of traditions, languages, and customs. This diversity not only enriched the social fabric of the community but also contributed to its resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity. Despite the differences that divided them, the settlers of Selkirk Colony shared a common goal: to carve out a place for themselves in the vast expanse of the Canadian prairies.  The early years of Selkirk Colony were marked by hardships and setbacks. Harsh weather conditions, crop failures, and outbreaks of disease tested the resolve of the settlers and threatened to derail their dreams of a better life. However, through sheer grit and determination, the pioneers of Selkirk Colony persevered, learning to adapt to the challenges of their new environment and finding innovative ways to overcome the obstacles that stood in their way.  One of the key factors contributing to the success of Selkirk Colony was the solidarity and sense of community that prevailed among its inhabitants. Neighbors banded together in times of need, offering support, encouragement, and practical assistance to those facing difficulties. This sense of shared purpose and mutual aid helped to strengthen the bonds that held the colony together, creating a tight-knit community that stood united in the face of adversity.  As the years passed, Selkirk Colony flourished, its fields yielding bountiful harvests, its population expanding, and its infrastructure growing ever more sophisticated. The settlers of Selkirk Colony built schools, churches, and communal spaces, creating a vibrant and dynamic community that thrived in the midst of the prairie wilderness. Through hard work, determination, and an unwavering belief in the promise of a better tomorrow, the pioneers of Selkirk Colony transformed a rugged frontier into a flourishing settlement that stood as a testament to the power of human resilience and ingenuity.  Today, Selkirk Colony stands as a monument to the indomitable spirit of its early settlers, a reminder of their courage, tenacity, and unwavering faith in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. The legacy of Selkirk Colony lives on in the descendants of its pioneers, who continue to cherish and celebrate the history and heritage of their forebears. As we reflect on the story of Selkirk Colony and its role in the early settlement of western Canada, we are reminded of the enduring power of human ambition, cooperation, and perseverance in the face of daunting challenges.  In conclusion, Selkirk Colony represents a testament to the resilience and fortitude of early settlers who braved the unknown to establish a new life in the Canadian wilderness.

Their legacy serves as a source of inspiration and a reminder of the transformative impact that human determination and solidarity can have in shaping the course of history.""","807"
"Walling William English","""Since then their influence has rapidly receded. The spirit of the international movement, on the whole, is more and more that of the great German Socialist Wilhelm Liebknecht, who advised the party to be 'always on the offensive and never on the defensive,' or of La Salle when he declared, 'True political power will have to be fought for, and cannot be bought.' The revolutionary policy of the leading Socialist parties has not become less pronounced with their growth and maturity as opponents hoped it would. On the contrary, all the most important Socialist assemblies of the last ten years, from the International Congress at Paris in 900, have reiterated or strengthened the old position. The Congress of Paris in 900 adopted a resolution introduced by Kautsky which declared that the 'Social Democracy has taken to itself the task of organizing the working people into an army ready for the social war, and it must, therefore, above all else, make sure that the working classes become conscious of their interests and of their power.' The great task of the Socialists at the present time is the preparation of the social war of the future, and not any effort to improve the capitalists' society. The working classes are to be made conscious of their own strength--which will surely not be brought about by any reforms which, however much they may benefit the workers, favor equally or to a still greater degree the capitalistic and governing classes. The resolution continued: 'The proletariat in a modern democratic State cannot obtain political power accidentally. It can do so only when the long and difficult work of the political and economic organization of the proletariat is at an end, when its physical and moral regeneration have been accomplished, and when more and more seats have been won in municipal and other legislative bodies. But where the government is centralized, political power cannot be obtained step by step.' (The italics are mine.) According to the proposer and mover of this resolution and its supporters, nearly all, if not all, modern governments are at the bottom centralized in one form or another. So the resolution amounts to saying that political power cannot be obtained step by step. The election of Socialist minorities in the legislatures can only be used to urge capitalism on its work of bringing up the physical condition and industrial productivity of the masses, and not for the purpose of organizing and educating them with the object of seizing the reins of power, of overthrowing capitalism, and revolutionizing the present form of government. The resolution adopted at the following International Congress at necessitated by certain ambiguities in the former one. Yet Kautsky's explanation of his own meaning makes it quite clear that even the Paris resolution was revolutionary in its intent, and the Amsterdam Congresses, moreover, readopted its main proposition that 'the Social Democracy could not accept any participation in government in capitalist society.' At this latter congress Jaures's proposed reformist tactics were definitely and finally rejected so that they have not even been discussed at the later international gatherings. This was a critical moment in the international movement; for it was about this time that the tendency to opportunism was at its strongest, and this was the year in which it was decided against Jaures that all Millerands of the future, impatient to seize immediate power in the name of Socialism, no matter how sincerely they might hope in this way to benefit the movement, should be looked upon as traitors to the cause. The terms upon which such power was secured or held were considered necessarily to be such as to compromise the principles of the movement. Socialists in high government positions, it was pointed out, by the very fact of their acceptance of such responsibilities, become servants of a capitalistic administration--and of the economic regime it supports. Jaures began his argument with the proposition that the difference between Socialism and mere reform consisted in the fact that the former alone worked for 'a total realization of all reforms' and 'the complete transformation of capitalistic property into social property'--which is merely the statement of Socialism as an ultimate ideal, now indorsed even by many anti-Socialists. He next quoted Liebknecht to the effect that there were only 00,00 individuals in Germany, and Guesde, Jaures's chief Socialist opponent in France, to the effect that the number was the same in the latter country, who, on account of their economic interests, were directly and completely opposed to Socialism; and this being the case, he held that the task of the body of working people already organized by the Socialists against capitalism, was gradually to draw all but this 00,00 into the Socialist ranks. He concluded that it was the duty of the Socialists to 'ward off reaction, to obtain reforms and to develop labor legislation' by the help of this larger mass, which, when added to their own numbers, constituted 7 or 8 per cent of the population. It goes without saying, replied the revolutionaries, that all Socialists will lend their assistance to any elements of the population who are fighting against reaction and in favor of labor legislation and reform, but it does not follow that they should consider this the chief part of their work, nor that they should even feel it necessary to claim that the Socialists were leading the non-Socialists in these matters. In contrasting his section of the French Party with the German movement, Jaures claimed that the French were both more revolutionary than the German, and more practical in their efforts at immediate reform. 'You,' he said, speaking to the Germans, 'have neither a revolutionary nor a parliamentary activity.' He reminded them that having never had a revolution they could not have a revolutionary tradition, that universal suffrage had been given to them from came up for discussion at the German Congress of Leipzig, it was unanimously reaffirmed. Those opposing it did not dare to dispute it at all in principle, but merely expressed the mental reservation that it was qualified by another resolution adopted at a recent Congress which had declared that the party should be absolutely free to decide the question of temporary political alliances in elections.""","""Socialism and revolutionary politics""","1223","""Socialism, a political and economic ideology advocating for communal ownership and democratic control over the means of production, distribution, and exchange, has long been associated with revolutionary politics. Rooted in principles of equality, social justice, and solidarity, socialism aims to challenge the existing capitalist system and create a more equitable society. Revolutionary politics within the context of socialism seek to challenge and transform the existing power structures that perpetuate inequality and exploitation. Through this essay, we will delve into the relationship between socialism and revolutionary politics, exploring key concepts, historical examples, and contemporary relevance.  Central to socialism is the belief that capitalism breeds and perpetuates inequality, with wealth and power concentrated in the hands of a few while the majority struggles to make ends meet. Socialists argue that the profit-driven nature of capitalism leads to exploitation of labor, environmental degradation, and social injustices. By advocating for social ownership of the means of production, socialists seek to create a system where resources are shared more equally and decisions are made democratically to benefit society as a whole.  Revolutionary politics within socialism emphasize the need for radical change to uproot the capitalist system and establish a socialist society. Revolution, in this context, does not necessarily imply violent upheaval but rather a fundamental shift in power dynamics and societal structures. Socialists believe that incremental reforms within the capitalist system are insufficient to address the root causes of inequality and injustice, calling for systemic transformation through revolutionary means.  Historically, socialism and revolutionary politics have been intertwined in various movements and revolutions around the world. The Russian Revolution of 1917, led by the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the existing monarchy and established the world's first socialist state. The revolution aimed to transfer power to the working class and implement socialist policies, including nationalization of industry and land redistribution. Similarly, the Cuban Revolution of 1959, led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, sought to overthrow a corrupt dictatorship and establish a socialist system based on principles of social justice and anti-imperialism.  While some socialist revolutions have resulted in authoritarian regimes and human rights abuses, others have inspired social movements and political change. The legacy of socialist revolutions continues to shape political discourse and activism, with ongoing struggles for social and economic justice worldwide. In recent years, movements like Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and the Global Climate Strikes have drawn attention to income inequality, racial injustice, and environmental degradation, highlighting the enduring relevance of socialist ideals in contemporary society.  In the realm of electoral politics, socialist politicians like Bernie Sanders in the United States and Jeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom have gained popularity by advocating for progressive policies such as universal healthcare, free education, and higher taxes on the wealthy. These politicians have sought to challenge the status quo and promote socialist principles within existing political systems, sparking debate and mobilizing support among a growing number of voters disillusioned with neoliberal capitalism.  Critics of socialism often argue that it stifles individual initiative, undermines economic efficiency, and leads to government overreach. They point to historical examples of failed socialist experiments and authoritarian regimes as evidence of socialism's inherent flaws. However, supporters of socialism contend that these examples do not represent the full spectrum of socialist thought and practice, emphasizing the diversity of socialist movements and the potential for democratic socialism to address contemporary challenges.  In conclusion, socialism and revolutionary politics are intertwined concepts that seek to address systemic injustices and create a more equitable society. While historical examples of socialist revolutions have varied in their outcomes and impacts, the core principles of socialism continue to inspire movements for social change and political reform. Whether through grassroots activism, electoral politics, or mass mobilizations, the spirit of socialism persists as a beacon of hope for a fairer and more just world.""","745"
"Marsh Sylvester","""When the object has been injected with Prussian blue, a few drops of hydrochloric acid should be added to the alcohol to fix the color. It may here be observed, that specimens of morbid tissues require, as a general rule, a shorter immersion in chromic acid solution than healthy tissues do. A very small degree of overhardening speedily renders them brittle and useless. They should, therefore, be removed from the acid medium at the end of ten days or a fortnight, and their further hardening carried on by means of alcohol.. Cutting Hardened Tissues by Hand. Our material being now reduced to a fit condition for cutting, let us proceed to consider the several methods by which this may be effected. The readiest and most simple plan, if the piece be large enough, is to hold it in the left hand, and, having brought the surface to a perfect level by cutting off several rather thick slices, endeavor to cut a thin section by the aid of a very sharp razor, the blade of which must be kept well flooded with spirit. As in the use of Valentins knife, so here, great care must be taken steadily to draw the blade across the tissue, every effort being made to avoid pushing the knife, else the section will be torn off, instead of being cut. Though this method is of very great importance for many purposes, yet a considerable degree of manipulative skill is required to enable the operator to obtain anything like perfect sections by its means, and, unfortunately, this skill is acquired by very few persons indeed, even after much practice. If the piece which it is desired to cut be too small to be conveniently held in the hand, it may be imbedded in paraffine in the manner already be cut with ease. As this method of imbedding, however, is most frequently resorted to where, by its means, special difficulties have to be overcome, a full description of the be deferred until such special cases come to be spoken of. Footnote: Note C.. Microtome. Although the preceding plans may be sufficient to answer all his requirements, if the student wishes to obtain only one or two sections of small dimensions, of a given object, if he requires a number of such sections he will find these methods fail him, for even though by practice he may have attained to considerable aptitude in the use of the knife, it will still unquestionably happen that the vast majority of his sections will be more or less imperfect. If, therefore, it be desired to procure a number of perfect sections, of equable thickness and large area, it is absolutely necessary to resort to the use of some form or other of microtome, or section-cutter. This instrument, in its simplest form, merely consists of a stout brass tube closed at one end, and being by the other fixed at right angles into a smooth plate of metal. A plug or disk of brass, accurately fitting the interior of the tube, is acted upon by a fine threaded screw piercing the base of the tube, and by means of which the plug, and any object it may support, can be elevated at pleasure. The object by this means being made gradually to rise out of the tube, sections are cut from it by simply gliding a sharp knife along the smooth cutting-plate, and hence across the specimen. Any intelligent worker in brass would make an instrument of this kind at a very small cost, and although perhaps it might lack the finish of an instrument bought at the opticians, it would, if accurately made, do its work as well as the most complicated and expensive. If, however, the student resolves to purchase a microtome, there are a variety of forms in the market from which he may choose. A few hints may perhaps be of service in enabling him to make a judicious selection. At the outset we may say that unless the student intends to devote himself solely to the production of sections of wood, etc., he ought not to procure one of those forms of microtome known as wood section-cutters, in which the object to be cut is held in position in the tube by means of a binding screw which pierces its side. Although these machines are all that can be desired for cutting hard bodies, they are not so suitable for soft ones. The chief points to be attended to in selecting a microtome are, that the cutting-plate of the instrument be made of glass, or in default of this, of very hard metal of the most perfect smoothness; that the diameter of the tube be neither too large nor too small it ought not to be less than -in., or greater than inch; that the screw, which should be fine and well cut, be provided with a graduated head; that there be some kind of index by which fractional portions of a revolution of the screw may be measured; the plug fit the tube of the microtome so accurately that when melted paraffine, gum, or other imbedding agent be poured into it, it may not find its way between the plug and side of the to constitute it a very expensive proceeding. Another serious disadvantage they possess is, that if the supply of ther be intermitted for only a very short time, the already frozen tissue thaws with great and most inconvenient rapidity. 0. Section-Knife. Of not less importance than the microtome is the section-knife, to be used in conjunction with it. How perfect soever the former, and whatever the dexterity of the operator, unless he be provided with a suitable and well-made knife, he will never succeed in obtaining satisfactory results. As to the most desirable size of the knife, much difference of opinion seems to exist, section knives varying in this respect from a blade of extreme shortness to one which fell under our observation, in which the portentous length of thirteen inches was attained. What advantages were to be expected by prolonging the blade to this extravagant length, must remain an inscrutable mystery to all save its designer. Concerning the shape of the knife, it is frequently advised that the surface which has to glide along the cutting-plate of the microtome should be ground flat. A most unsuitable arrangement, as a very little actual experience of section-cutting will speedily demonstrate. After many unsuccessful attempts to obtain a really good and reliable section-knife, we determined to have one specially made, which, as it has proved everything that could be desired, merits a brief description. It is of the utmost importance that the blade be made of good and well-tempered steel, not only that it may be capable of receiving an edge of the most exquisite keenness, but also that it may retain it. The knife of which we furnished with a blade four inches long, and -inch broad, set into a square handle of boxwood, also four inches in length. The thickness of the blade at the back is not quite -inch, while both of its surfaces are slightly hollow ground.""","""Tissue preparation and sectioning techniques""","1425","""Tissue preparation and sectioning are crucial steps in biological research and medical diagnostics, allowing scientists and healthcare professionals to visualize and study cellular structures in detail. Proper tissue preparation and sectioning techniques are essential for obtaining high-quality samples that accurately represent the biological processes being studied. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the various methods and considerations involved in tissue preparation and sectioning.  **Tissue Preparation:**  1. **Fixation:** The first step in tissue preparation is fixation, which stabilizes the cellular structures and prevents degradation. Formaldehyde is a commonly used fixative that cross-links proteins in the tissue. Other fixatives such as ethanol and methanol may be used depending on the specific requirements of the study.  2. **Dehydration:** After fixation, tissues are dehydrated through a series of alcohol washes to remove water and prepare them for embedding in paraffin or resin. Gradual dehydration helps to preserve tissue morphology and prevent distortion.  3. **Clearing:** Following dehydration, tissues are cleared to remove alcohol and make them transparent for embedding in an embedding medium. Xylene and other organic solvents are often used for this purpose.  4. **Embedding:** Tissues are embedded in a solid medium like paraffin or resin to provide support for sectioning. Paraffin embedding is commonly used for routine histology, while resin embedding is preferred for electron microscopy and other specialized techniques.  5. **Sectioning:**  **Cryosectioning:** Cryosectioning is a technique used to cut frozen tissues into thin sections for analysis. It is particularly useful for preserving tissue antigens and enzyme activity. Tissues are frozen using cryoprotectants like OCT compound and then sectioned using a cryostat at controlled temperatures.  **Paraffin Sectioning:** Paraffin-embedded tissues are cut into thin sections using a microtome. The tissue block is mounted on the microtome, and sections are cut at the desired thickness, typically ranging from 4 to 7 micrometers. These sections can then be mounted on slides for staining and analysis.  **Ultra-Thin Sectioning:** Ultrathin sections, on the other hand, are typically used for electron microscopy. Resin-embedded tissues are cut into ultrathin sections (around 50-100 nm thick) using an ultramicrotome equipped with a diamond or glass knife. These sections allow for high-resolution imaging of cellular structures.  **Considerations for Tissue Sectioning:**  1. **Section Thickness:** The thickness of tissue sections is crucial, as it directly impacts the quality of imaging and analysis. Thin sections are ideal for electron microscopy, while thicker sections are more suitable for certain staining techniques.  2. **Sectioning Artifacts:** During sectioning, artifacts such as folding, tearing, and compression of tissues may occur, affecting the interpretation of results. Careful handling and proper training in sectioning techniques can help minimize these artifacts.  3. **Quality Control:** Regularly monitoring section quality through staining and imaging can help ensure consistency and reliability in experimental results. Quality control measures should be implemented throughout the tissue preparation and sectioning process.  4. **Choosing the Right Technique:** The choice of sectioning technique depends on the specific research objectives and downstream applications. For example, cryosectioning is preferred for studies requiring preservation of native tissue antigens, while paraffin sectioning is suitable for routine histological analysis.  5. **Automation:** With advancements in technology, automated sectioning machines are available that allow for high-throughput and precise sectioning of tissues. These machines offer increased efficiency and reproducibility in tissue sectioning, particularly in large-scale research projects.  6. **Staining and Imaging:** Following sectioning, tissues are typically stained using various techniques to visualize cellular structures and biomolecules. Hematoxylin and eosin staining is commonly used for general histological analysis, while immunohistochemistry and fluorescent staining are employed for specific protein localization studies.  7. **Storage:** Proper storage of tissue sections is essential to maintain their integrity for future analysis. Sections can be stored at optimal temperatures and humidity levels to prevent degradation and ensure long-term preservation.  In conclusion, tissue preparation and sectioning techniques play a critical role in generating high-quality samples for research and diagnostic purposes. By understanding the principles behind these techniques and following best practices, scientists and healthcare professionals can obtain accurate and reliable data from tissue samples, leading to advances in our understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms.""","905"
"Rawlings Gertrude Burford","""The book-writers or copyists became, later, the booksellers, very much as they did in old Rome. Sometimes they both wrote and sold the books, and sometimes the sellers employed the writers to write for them, or the writers employed the sellers to sell for them. Publishers as yet did not exist. Practically the only method of publication known consisted of the reading of a work on three days in succession before the heads of the University, or other public judges, and the sanctioning of its transcription and reproduction. The booksellers were called 'stationers,' either because they transacted their business at open stalls or stations, or perhaps from the fact that statio is low Latin for shop; and since they were also the vendors of parchment and other writing-materials, the word 'stationer' is still used to designate those who carry on a similar trade to-day. As early as 403 there was already formed in London a society or brotherhood 'of the Craft of Writers of Text-letter,' and 'those commonly called 'Limners,' or Illuminators, for in that year they petitioned the Lord Mayor for permission to elect Wardens empowered to see that the trades were honourably pursued and to punish those of the craft who dealt disloyally or who rebelled against the Wardens' authority. This petition was granted. By 5/801 the Company of Stationers was established, and it is highly probable that this was only the Brotherhood of Text-writers and Limners under the more general designation. The well-known names of Paternoster Row, Amen Corner, Ave Maria Lane, and Creed Lane still remain to show us where the London stationers who sold the common religious leaflets and devotional books of the day had their stalls, close to St Paul's Cathedral, and in some cases even against the walls of the Cathedral itself, and where, too, the makers of beads and paternosters plied their trade. And Londoners at least will not need to be reminded that at this very moment Paternoster Row is almost entirely inhabited by sellers of books, religious and otherwise. There is also a queer open-air stall on the south side which serves to carry on the ancient tradition of the place. Societies similar to that of the Text-Writers and Limners of London also existed on the Continent, and especially at Bruges, in which city literature and book-production flourished under the patronage of Philippe le Bon, Duke of Burgundy, who himself gave constant employment to numerous writers, copyists, translators, and illuminators in the work of building up his famous library. The members of the Guild of St John the Evangelist in Bruges represented no less than fifteen different trades or professions connected with books and writing. They included: Booksellers, Printsellers, Painters of vignettes, Painters, Scriveners and copiers of books, Schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, Illuminators, Printers, Bookbinders, Curriers, Cloth shearers, Parchment and vellum makers, Boss carvers, Letter engravers, Figure engravers. Of course, the printers here mentioned would at first be block-printers only, as will be shown presently. And it is worth noticing that in all this long list, which cannot be called at all exclusive, there is no mention of authors. The medival booksellers were not all permitted to ply their trade in their own way. Since the supply of books for the students depended on them, the Universities of Paris, Oxford, and elsewhere deemed it their duty to keep them under control, having in view the maintenance of pure texts and the interests of the students, at whose expense the booksellers were not to be permitted to fatten. By the rules of the University of Paris the bookseller was required to be a man of wide learning and high character, and to bind himself to observe the laws regarding books laid down by the University. He was forbidden to offer any transcript for sale until it had been examined and found correct; and were any inaccuracy detected in it by the examiner, he was liable to a fine or the burning of the book, according to the magnitude of his error. The price of books was also fixed by the University, and the vendor forbidden to make more than a certain rate of profit on each volume. Again, the bookseller could not purchase any books without the sanction of the University, for fear that he might be the means of disseminating heretical or immoral literature. Later, it was made obligatory on him to lend out books on hire to those who could not afford to buy them, and to expose in his shop a list of these books and the charges at which they were to be had. The poor booksellers, thus hedged about with restrictions, often joined some other occupation to that of selling manuscripts in order to make both ends meet, but when this practice came to the notice of the University they were censured for degrading their noble profession by mixing with it 'vile trades.' But presumably no such rules as the above hampered the booksellers of non-university towns, such as London. The control assumed by the Universities over the book trade presently extended to interference with original writings and a censorship of literature. With the introduction of printing and the consequent increase of books and of the facilities for reproducing them this censorship was taken up by the Church. Ecclesiastical censorship, however, was not the outcome of the Universities' assumption of control over the book trade. It sprang from the jealousy of the clergy, who opposed the spread of knowledge among the people--some, perhaps, because they knew that knowledge in ignorant hands is dangerous, and others because they feared their own prestige might suffer. This feeling existed before printing, though printing brought it to a head. For instance, in 415/8 the penalty in this country for reading the Scriptures in the vernacular was forfeiture of land, cattle, body, life, and goods by the offenders and their heirs for ever, and that they should be condemned for heretics to God, enemies to the Crown, and most errant traitors to the land. They were refused right of sanctuary, and if they persisted in the offence or relapsed after a pardon were first to be hanged for treason against the King and then burned for heresy against God. Thus the clergy upheld and encouraged a censorship of the press. As early as 479 Conrad de Homborch, a Cologne printer, had issued a Bible accompanied by canons, etc., which was 'allowed and approved by the University of Cologne,' and in 486 the Archbishop of Mentz issued a mandate forbidding the translation into the vulgar tongue of Greek, Latin, and other books, without the previous approbation of the University. Finally, in 5/815/8, a bull of Leo X. required Bishops and Inquisitors to examine all books before they came to be printed, and to suppress any heretical matter. The Vicar of Croydon, preaching at St Paul's Cross about the time of the spread of the art of printing, is said to have declared that 'we must root out printing or printing will root out us.' But an ecclesiastical censorship over the English press was not established until 5/85/89, when an Injunction issued by Queen Elizabeth provides that, because of the publication of unfruitful, vain, and infamous books and papers, 'no manner of person shall print any manner of boke or paper. except the same be first licenced by her maiestie. or by.vi. of her privy counsel, or be perused and licensed by the archbysshops of Cantorbury and Yorke, the bishop of London,' etc. The Injunction extended also to 'pampheletes, playes, and balletes,' so that 'nothinge therein should be either heretical, sedicious, or vnsemely for Christian eares.' Classical authors, however, and works hitherto commonly received in universities and schools were not touched by the Injunction. V IN MEDIVAL During the rule of the Arabs in Northern Africa and in Spain, thousands of manuscripts were gathered together in their chief cities, such as Cairo and Cordova, and many Arabic-Spanish and Moorish writings have been preserved in the Escurial Library, though a large part of this library was burnt in 671. With these exceptions, the collections of books belonging to the various religious houses were practically the only libraries of early medival times. These collections, to begin with, were very small; so small, indeed, that there was no need to set apart a special room for them. Library buildings were not erected till the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries, when the accumulation of books rendered them necessary, and those which are found in connection with old foundations will always prove to have been added later. It is said, however, that Gozbert, abbot of St Gall in the ninth century, who founded the library there by collecting what was then the large number of four hundred books, allotted them a special room over the scriptorium. But as a rule the books were kept in the church, and then, as the number increased, in the cloisters. The cloister was the common living-room of the monks, where they read and studied, and carried out most of their daily duties. The books were either stored in presses, though no such press remains to show us upon what pattern they were built, or in recesses in the wall, probably closed by doors. Two of these recesses may be seen in the cloisters at Worcester. In Cistercian houses, says Mr J. W. Clark, to whose Rede am indebted for these details, this recess developed 'into a small square room without a window, and but little larger than an ordinary cupboard. In the plans of Clairvaux and Kirkstall this room is placed between the chapter-house and the transept of the church; and similar rooms, in similar situations, have been found at Fountains, Beaulieu, Tintern, Netley, etc.' The books were placed on shelves round the walls.""","""History of book publishing and censorship""","2077","""Book publishing has a rich and intricate history intertwined with the development of human civilization. From the dawn of writing systems to the digital age, the dissemination of knowledge and ideas through books has played a vital role in shaping societies. However, this journey has not been without challenges, particularly in the form of censorship, where governments, religious authorities, and other entities have sought to control or limit the content of published works.  The history of book publishing dates back to ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Greece, where early forms of writing were inscribed on clay tablets, papyrus scrolls, and later, parchment manuscripts. The advent of the printing press in the 15th century by Johannes Gutenberg revolutionized the production of books, making them more accessible to the masses. This technological leap led to the proliferation of ideas, fueling the Renaissance, Reformation, and the Enlightenment.  Throughout history, books have been censored for various reasons, including political, religious, and moral concerns. In ancient Rome, the Roman Senate maintained a list of prohibited books to suppress dissenting views. The Catholic Church established the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of Forbidden Books) in the 16th century to combat heresy and promote orthodoxy. During the Inquisition, books deemed heretical were burned, and authors faced persecution.  The Enlightenment period challenged existing power structures, leading to debates on the freedom of expression and the role of censorship. Philosophers like John Locke and Voltaire advocated for the freedom of the press, arguing that open discourse and the free exchange of ideas were essential for societal progress. However, governments and institutions continued to censor works perceived as subversive or dangerous.  In the 20th century, the rise of totalitarian regimes brought about unprecedented levels of censorship. Nazi Germany burned books deemed """"un-German"""" or contrary to Nazi ideology, targeting Jewish authors, intellectuals, and political dissidents. Similarly, Soviet Russia imposed strict censorship policies to control information and suppress dissent. Authors such as George Orwell and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn faced persecution for their critical works.  The advent of the digital age has transformed the landscape of book publishing and censorship. The internet has democratized the dissemination of information, allowing authors to bypass traditional publishing gatekeepers. Self-publishing platforms and e-books have empowered writers to reach global audiences without facing traditional censorship mechanisms. However, this newfound freedom has also raised concerns about the spread of misinformation and hate speech.  In modern times, censorship continues to be a contentious issue, with debates surrounding hate speech, political correctness, and the limits of free expression. Governments, social media platforms, and interest groups grapple with balancing the right to free speech with the need to protect vulnerable populations from harmful content. The concept of censorship has evolved beyond traditional book banning to include online content moderation and algorithmic filtering.  Despite these challenges, the history of book publishing and censorship underscores the enduring power of written words to influence hearts and minds. Books have sparked revolutions, challenged authoritarian regimes, and shaped cultural identities. As technology continues to advance, the future of publishing and censorship remains uncertain, raising critical questions about who controls the narrative and what voices are allowed to be heard. Ultimately, the struggle for freedom of expression and access to diverse viewpoints remains at the core of the ongoing dialogue on book publishing and censorship.""","670"
"Sheavyn Phoebe","""The University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, is, for women, entirely residential; and the University College of Reading requires both men and women to live in Halls. All the other Halls, large or small, for women students, but do not compel residence. Lists of Halls can be obtained from the University prospectuses; and applications for be made direct to the various Wardens or Principals. The demand for accommodation is everywhere very great; and it is practically impossible to secure admission unless application is made at least a year in advance. It is usually a great additional benefit for foreign students to reside in a Hall; and every effort should be made to secure provisional acceptance beforehand. In regard to the meaning the terms 'College' and 'Hall,' it may be said 'Hall' provides residence only; the 'College' provides teaching, and arranges for admission into the University, while it may, or may not, also provide residence. Discipline varies from one University to another from the comparatively strict discipline necessitated in old Universities with a long tradition of obedience and convention; or in smaller Universities which are the centre of interest in small towns such as Reading and Aberystwyth; to the freedom of the great civic University, compelled to accord almost complete social liberty to the large numbers of men and women living in their own homes; and comfortably sheltered from censorious criticism among the many more exciting attractions existing in every great city. In some Universities men and women students may not converse together in the streets; in others they may freely meet, walk, take meals, and study together. In all Universities and Colleges there is much Social Intercourse and gaiety. Dancing is very frequent; dramatic performances, common; and almost every Honours School or Department has its Society for the encouragement of its special subject, and the promotion of social intercourse among its members. Even in Oxford and Cambridge some of these Societies include both men and women. Residential Colleges and Halls usually provide 'Common' (or 'Combination') Rooms where staff or students can meet each other; and the mixed Universities set apart rooms, usually separate for men and for women, for the hours of the day not devoted to study. These may be simply sitting-rooms with restaurant attached, as in the smaller institutions, or may be, in the more established modern Universities, large, well-furnished Union Buildings or club-houses, as provided in Edinburgh, Liverpool, or Manchester. The management of these Unions, as to both finance and discipline, is usually in the hands of the students themselves. In no University, however, does the accommodation for women compare in dignity, commodiousness, or spaciousness with that provided in many American institutions. With the exception of some of the oldest Universities, where the provision for men is ample and beautiful, University and College buildings in Great Britain are upon a wholly different scale from those in the United States. While laboratories are often excellently equipped, libraries and lecture-rooms are not infrequently inadequate, and the provision for recreation, physical well-being, and social intercourse is sometimes seriously wanting. Nothing exists in our modern Universities at all comparable with the magnificent buildings, the extensive grounds, woods and lakes, the immense gymnasiums and swimming baths, provided for women students in the United States. And in the older of our civic Universities, the cramped conditions of existence in the midst of an immense city are responsible for the absence of many social amenities. In the smaller, younger Universities an attempt is being made to secure more space for future development before it is too late; but the standards even there are far below those known in the United States. English girls of aristocratic or wealthy parentage do not as yet go to the University in large numbers; most of the students come from homes of limited means, and their demands, except in the matter of education pure and simple, are modest. At the same time, one never hears of students, as in American Colleges, paying their expenses by giving personal service; it would, in fact, be very difficult for the average student to spare sufficient time from her studies, which are exacting enough to leave her only the minimum amount of leisure essential for recreation. Finance is a matter for serious concern in our Universities, largely dependent as they are upon small public grants and private benefactions; and in Women's Colleges and Halls this question is still more pressing. It should be remembered that the numbers in our Women's Colleges are small; all the five Women's Colleges together in Oxford do not number 00 students. Moreover, though the generous benefactor exists in this country, his gifts are on a comparatively modest scale, and institutions specially for women do not attract the largest. Libraries. The most complete collections of books are those of the privileged libraries, the British Museum Library, the, and the Municipal Reference Library. Expenses. University education in Great Britain is not free, as in some countries; although in the case of a certain number of students, Government grants or local scholarships cover the expenses more or less completely. It is extremely difficult to give any figures as to the cost of a University training, on account of the great difference in the fees and the general absence of any inclusive charge. It is, moreover, to be noted that, where the University includes several Colleges, there are often both College fees and University fees. The fees for residence in College, again, may or may not include also the fees for tuition and lectures. Life at Cambridge is, for women, rather more expensive than in other Universities; but in Oxford it is less expensive to be a member of the Society of Home Students than to reside in a College, and in Cambridge the small number of older students permitted by the Colleges to be 'out-students' can live more cheaply. Again, the extreme brevity of the terms in Cambridge and Oxford entails heavy vacation expenses for the foreign student. At Oxford and Cambridge the cost of board, lodging and tuition for the session, consisting of three terms of eight to nine weeks each, varies from 35/8 to 5/80. Next in order of expense comes London, where the fees for residence in College, apart from tuition, are 0 to 00. In the larger University cities of England, residence costs about 0; in the smaller places, in Wales and in Scotland, it is lower ( 0 to 0). Where the fees for guidance or tuition in advanced work are charged separately from those for residence, they vary from to 5/8 in the Faculty of Arts; in the Faculty of Science they usually depend on the nature of the practical work involved. For the examination of these the charge may be from to 0, and for the conferment of the degree from to 0. FOR. Most of the women students in British Universities are intending to earn their living; the exceptions being a few at Oxford and Cambridge. The careers most fully open to them are teaching and medicine, for which full professional training is provided in the Universities. A large army of women graduates is employed in the Secondary Schools, and many women doctors hold positions in hospitals, especially in those for women and children, or carry on private practice. Pharmacy is chosen as an occupation by many women, and in dentistry there is plenty of room though very few women enter upon it. Students showing marked talent fairly often obtain grants enabling them to prosecute research for a year or two; a few private commercial firms employ research workers and occasionally engage a woman; but the opportunities of this kind are comparatively rare. A certain number of women in practically every University now hold positions as Demonstrators in laboratories, or as Assistant Lecturers or Lecturers; a very few are Professors. Some are employed as lecturers under organisations for extending advanced teaching outside the Universities. Such are the Workers' Educational Association, and the various University Extension Schemes. In the Civil Service (which is the general name for the various departments of work under the Government), University women are employed in some numbers under the Board of Education, the Home Office, the Ministry of Health and the Local Government Board, as Inspectors and Medical Officers. The Ministry of Labour and the Post Office, while employing large numbers of women, offer very few posts suitable for University graduates. During the war many women held in Government offices positions of importance and responsibility; but most of them have now been dispensed with under the plea of economy, or of providing employment for discharged soldiers. A very few of these women, however, still retain their posts, and there is a fairly powerful movement for opening the higher positions in the Civil Service to women.""","""University Women's Accommodation and Education""","1747","""University women's accommodation and education have seen significant transformations over the years, evolving from a time when women were largely excluded from higher education to the present-day scenario where women not only have access to education but also are actively shaping the academic landscape. This progress has been aided by improvements in accommodation options for female students, empowering them to pursue their academic aspirations without the constraints of inadequate housing. Let's delve into the importance of suitable accommodation for university women and how it contributes to their overall educational experience.  In the past, women faced numerous barriers in accessing higher education, with limited opportunities and discriminatory practices. One major challenge was the lack of appropriate accommodation options for female students. Universities often prioritized housing for male students, leaving women to fend for themselves in finding suitable living arrangements. This not only posed safety concerns but also hindered their ability to fully engage in academic life. Without secure and comfortable housing, women's educational pursuits were often compromised, leading to decreased retention rates and lower academic achievement.  Recognizing the importance of creating a conducive environment for all students, universities have made significant strides in improving women's accommodation options. Modern-day campus housing facilities now offer a range of amenities tailored to meet the specific needs of female students. From well-lit and secure living spaces to gender-inclusive facilities, universities are committed to providing a safe and supportive environment that fosters academic success and personal growth.  One key aspect of women's accommodation in universities is the promotion of inclusivity and diversity. Creating a welcoming and inclusive living environment is essential for female students to thrive academically. By offering gender-neutral spaces, ensuring access to essential resources, and fostering a sense of community, universities are empowering women to fully participate in campus life. Additionally, providing housing options that cater to various needs, such as single rooms, quiet study areas, and proximity to academic buildings, allows women to focus on their studies without worrying about external distractions.  Moreover, the integration of supportive services within university accommodation plays a vital role in enhancing women's educational experience. Counselling services, mentorship programs, and peer support networks are key components that contribute to the holistic development of female students. By offering these resources within the accommodation setting, universities enable women to address academic challenges, navigate personal issues, and build strong support systems that enhance their overall well-being.  In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainability and eco-friendliness in university accommodation. Women students, in particular, are increasingly conscious of environmental issues and seek accommodation options that align with their values. Universities have responded by implementing green initiatives such as energy-efficient buildings, recycling programs, and sustainable living practices within student housing. By providing eco-friendly accommodation choices, universities empower women to make environmentally responsible decisions and contribute to a more sustainable future.  The role of accommodation in women's education extends beyond just a place to stay; it also influences academic performance, retention rates, and overall student satisfaction. Studies have shown that students who live on campus, particularly women, tend to have higher GPAs, increased engagement in campus activities, and stronger connections with their peers and faculty. By offering well-maintained and inclusive accommodation options, universities create a nurturing environment that supports women in their academic journey and personal development.  Furthermore, the concept of a living-learning community has gained popularity in university accommodation settings. These communities bring together students with shared academic interests or goals, providing a space for intellectual exchange, collaborative learning, and social interaction. For women students, living in a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment can enhance their educational experience, broaden their perspectives, and foster lifelong connections with like-minded peers.  Beyond the physical aspects of accommodation, universities are also focusing on creating a culture of respect, equality, and empowerment for all students. By implementing policies and programs that address issues such as gender-based violence, discrimination, and harassment, universities are promoting a safe and inclusive campus environment for women. Empowering women to speak out, seek support, and actively participate in shaping campus culture is essential in ensuring their academic success and well-being.  In conclusion, women's accommodation and education go hand in hand in shaping the college experience for female students. Access to safe, inclusive, and supportive housing plays a crucial role in empowering women to thrive academically, personally, and professionally. As universities continue to prioritize the well-being and success of women students, enhancing accommodation options, fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion, and providing access to essential support services are paramount in creating an environment where all women can excel and fulfill their academic potential. By investing in women's accommodation and education, universities not only support individual growth but also contribute to building a more equitable and vibrant academic community.""","926"
"Notestein Wallace","""Palmer had contracted with the Devil and had persuaded his kinswoman to assist him in procuring the death of a woman by the use of clay pictures. Both were probably practitioners in magic. Palmer, even when in prison, claimed the power of transforming men into beasts. The woman seems to have been put to the swimming test. Both were condemned. Palmer, at his execution, gave information about a 'whole colledge of witches,' most of them, no doubt, practisers like himself, but his random accusations were probably passed over.

It is impossible to understand the significance of the prosecutions without some acquaintance with the course of opinion on the subject. In this chapter we shall go back as far as the opening of the reign of James and follow up to the end of the Commonwealth the special discussions of witchcraft, as well as some of the more interesting incidental references. It will be recalled that James's Dmonologie had come out several years before its author ascended the English throne. With the coming of the Scottish king to Westminster the work was republished at London. But, while James by virtue of his position was easily first among those who were writing on the subject, he by no means occupied the stage alone. Not less than four other men gained a hearing within the reign and for that reason deserve consideration. They were Perkins, Cotta, Roberts, and Cooper. William Perkins's Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft came first in order, indeed it was written during the last years of Elizabeth's reign; but it was not published until 608, six years after the author's death. William Perkins was a fellow of Christ's College at Cambridge and an eminent preacher in that university. He holds a high place among Puritan divines. His sermons may still be found in the libraries of older clergymen and citations from them are abundant in commentaries. It was in the course of one of his university sermons that he took up the matter of witchcraft. In what year this sermon was preached cannot definitely be said. That he seems to have read Scot, that however he does not mention King James's book, are data which lead us to guess that he may have uttered the discourse between 5/884 and 5/897. His point of view was strictly theological and his convictions grounded--as might be expected--upon scriptural texts. Yet it seems not unfair to suppose that he was an exponent of opinion at Cambridge, where we have already seen evidences of strong faith in the reality of witchcraft. It seems no less likely that a perusal of Reginald Scot's Discoverie prompted the sermon. Witches nowadays, he admitted, have their patrons. His argument for the existence of witches was so thoroughly biblical that we need not go over it. He did not, however, hold to all current conceptions of them. The power of the evil one to transform human beings into other shapes he utterly repudiated. The scratching of witches and the testing of them by water he thought of no value.""","""Witchcraft Trials and Accusations""","2168","""In the dark annals of history, witchcraft trials and accusations have left a haunting legacy that continues to fascinate and disturb us to this day. The witch hunts that swept through Europe and the American colonies in the 16th and 17th centuries represent a dark chapter in human civilization, where irrational fears, religious zealotry, social tensions, and political power struggles converged to create a brutal and destructive phenomenon. These trials and accusations reflected deep-seated beliefs in magic, sorcery, and the supernatural, leading to the persecution, torture, and execution of countless innocent victims. Let's delve into the complexities of witchcraft trials and accusations, exploring the causes, consequences, and enduring impact of this harrowing period in history.  At the heart of the witchcraft hysteria lay a profound fear of the unknown and a deeply ingrained belief in the existence of malevolent forces that threatened the fabric of society. In a time of widespread poverty, disease, and religious upheaval, people sought explanations for their suffering and misfortune. Witchcraft provided a convenient scapegoat, offering a rationale for inexplicable events and tragedies. The notion of witches consorting with the devil, casting spells, causing harm, and engaging in dark rituals captured the imagination of the populace, fueling paranoia and suspicion.  Accusations of witchcraft often arose from personal grievances, rivalries, and social tensions. Women, in particular, were vulnerable to such accusations, as they were viewed with suspicion for their supposed mystical powers and perceived deviations from societal norms. Widows, healers, midwives, and unconventional women who defied traditional roles were especially targeted. The mere rumor of practicing witchcraft could tarnish one's reputation irreparably, leading to ostracism and persecution. As communities grappled with economic hardship and political instability, witch hunts became a means of diverting attention from underlying issues and maintaining social order through fear and control.  The legal framework of witchcraft trials varied across regions, but they shared common elements of injustice and cruelty. The accused faced a daunting ordeal, often devoid of due process and legal safeguards. Inquisitors relied on dubious evidence, such as spectral testimony, confessions obtained through torture, or mere accusations from vindictive neighbors. The accused had little chance of proving their innocence in a system rigged against them. Those found guilty faced gruesome fates, including imprisonment, public humiliation, torture, and execution by hanging or burning at the stake.  Perhaps the most infamous witch trials occurred in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692, where a wave of hysteria engulfed the community, leading to the execution of 20 individuals and the deaths of many more in jail. The Salem Witch Trials exemplify the destructive power of mass delusion, as unfounded accusations spiraled out of control, tearing apart families and shattering trust within the community. The aftermath of the trials brought shame and regret, prompting reflections on the human capacity for cruelty and the dangers of unchecked zealotry.  Despite the horrors of the witch hunts, some individuals demonstrated courage and compassion by challenging the prevailing narrative of witchcraft. Figures like Johann Weyer, a Dutch physician who debunked beliefs in witchcraft as superstition, and King James VI of Scotland, who criticized the methods of witch trials, offered a counterbalance to the prevailing hysteria. Their efforts to promote rational inquiry and skepticism paved the way for the eventual decline of witchcraft prosecutions in the 18th century.  The legacy of witchcraft trials and accusations continues to reverberate in our collective consciousness, serving as a cautionary tale about the dangers of intolerance, prejudice, and mass hysteria. The witch hunts exposed the fragility of justice in the face of irrational fears and societal pressures, reminding us of the importance of upholding the principles of fairness, reason, and compassion. By studying this dark chapter in history, we confront our capacity for cruelty and ignorance, and we strive to build a more just and inclusive society where individuals are judged on their actions and character, rather than superstitions and unfounded accusations.""","812"
"Dickinson John","""'How many British authors have demonstrated, that the present wealth, power and glory of their country, are founded upon these colonies? As constantly as streams tend to the ocean have they been pouring the fruits of all their labours into their mother's lap. Good heaven! and shall a total oblivion of former tendernesses and blessings, be spread over the minds of a good and wise nation by the sordid arts of intriguing men, who, covering their selfish projects under pretences of public good, first enrage their countrymen into a frenzy of passion, and then advance their own influence and interest, by gratifying the passion, which they themselves have basely excited. 'Hitherto Great Britain has been contented with her prosperity, moderation has been the rule of her conduct. But now, a generous, humane people, that so often have protected the liberty of strangers, is inflamed into an attempt to tear a privilege from her own children, which if executed, must, in their opinion, sink them into slaves: and for what? for a pernicious power, not necessary to her as her own experience may convince her; but horribly dreadful and detestable to her. 'It seems extremely probable, that when cool, dispassionate prosperity, shall consider the affectionate intercourse, the reciprocal benefits, and the unsuspecting confidence, that have subsisted between these colonies and their parent country, for such a length of time, they will execrate, with the bitterest curses, the infamous memory of those men, whose pestilential ambition unnecessarily, wantonly, first opened the sources of civil discord between them; first turned their love into jealousy; and first taught these provinces, filled with grief and anxiety, to enquire.' 'As every community possessed of valuable privileges, and desirous to preserve the enjoyment of them, ought to be very cautious of admitting innovations from their established forms of political administration, our Author does not confine his views to the immediate effects of the laws lately passed regarding America; but considers the necessary tendency of the precedents; thus he says, 'I have looked over every statute relating to these colonies, from their first settlement to this time; and I find everyone of them founded on this principle, till the stamp-act administration. All before, are calculated to regulate trade, and preserve or promote a mutually beneficial intercourse between the several constituent parts of the empire; and though many of them imposed duties on trade, yet those duties were always imposed with design to restrain the commerce of one part, that was injurious to another, and thus to promote the general welfare. The raising a revenue thereby was never intended. Thus, the king by his judges in his courts of justice, impose fines, which altogether amount to a very considerable sum, and contribute to the support of government; but this is merely a consequence arising from restrictions, that only meant to keep peace, and prevent confusion; and surely a man would argue very loosely, who should conclude from hence, that the king has a right to levy money in general upon his subjects. Never did the British parliament, till the period above mentioned, think of imposing duties in America, for the purpose of raising a revenue. Mr. Grenville first introduced this language, in the preamble to the fourth of George III. chap. 5/8, which has these words--'and whereas it is just and necessary that a revenue be raised in your majesty's said dominions in America, for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting and securing the same: We your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the commons of Great Britain, in Parliament assembled, being desirous to make some provisions in this present session of parliament, towards raising the said revenue in America, have resolved to give and grant unto your majesty the several rates and duties hereinafter mentioned,' etc. 'A few months after came the stamp-act, which reciting this, proceeds in the same strange mode of expression, thus--'And whereas it is just and necessary, that provision be made for raising a further revenue within your majesty's dominions in America, towards defraying the said expenses, we your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the commons of Great Britain, etc., give and grant,' etc., as before. 'The last act, granting duties upon paper, etc., carefully pursues these modern precedents. The preamble is, 'Whereas it is expedient, that a revenue should be raised in your majesty's dominions in America for making a more certain and adequate provision for defraying the charge of the administration of justice, and the support of civil government in such provinces, where it shall be found necessary; and towards the further defraying of the expences of defending, protecting, and securing the said dominions, we your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the commons of Great Britain, etc. give and grant,' etc. as before. 'Here we may observe an authority expresly claimed and exerted to impose duties on these colonies; not for the regulation of trade; not for the preservation or promotion of a mutually beneficial intercourse between the several constituent parts of the empire, heretofore the sole objects of parliamentary institutions; but for the single purpose of levying money upon us.' 'Again in another place, 'What but the indisputable, the acknowledged exclusive right of the colonies to tax themselves, could be the reason, that in this long period of more than one hundred and fifty years, no statute was ever passed for the sole purpose of raising a revenue from the colonies? And how clear, how cogent must that reason be, to which every parliament, and every ministry for so long a time submitted, without a single attempt to innovate? 'England, in part of that course of years, and Great Britain, in other parts, was engaged in several fierce and expensive wars; troubled with some tumultuous and bold parliaments; governed by many daring and wicked ministers; yet none of them ever ventured to touch the Palladium of American liberty. Ambition, avarice, faction, tyranny, all revered it. Whenever it was necessary to raise money on the colonies, the requisitions of the crown were made, and dutifully complied with. The parliament, from time to time, regulated their trade, and that of the rest of the empire, to preserve their dependence and the connections of the whole in good order.' 'The amount of present duties exacted in an unusual way is no part of the object in question; for our Pennsylvanian Farmer observes: 'Some persons may think this act of no consequence, because the duties are so small. A fatal error. That is the very circumstance most alarming to me. For I am convinced, that the authors of this law would never have obtained an act to raise so trifling a sum as it must do, had they not intended by it to establish a precedent for future use. To console ourselves with the smallness of the duties, is to walk deliberately into the snare that is set for us, praising the neatness of the workmanship. Suppose the duties imposed by the late act could be paid by these distressed colonies with the utmost ease, and that the purposes to which they are to be applied, were the most reasonable and equitable that can be conceived, the contrary of which I hope to demonstrate before these letters are concluded; yet even in such a supposed case, these colonies ought to regard the act with abhorrence. For who are a free people? Not those, over whom government is reasonably and equitably exercised, but those, who live under a government so constitutionally checked and controuled, that proper provision is made against its being otherwise exercised. 'The late act is founded on the destruction of this constitutional security. If the parliament have a right to lay a duty of four shillings and eight pence on a hundred weight of glass, or a ream of paper, they have a right to lay a duty of any other sum on either. They may raise the duty, as the author before quoted says has been done in some countries, till it 'exceeds seventeen or eighteen times the value of the commodity.' In short, if they have a right to levy a tax of one penny upon us, they have a right to levy a million upon us; for where does their right stop? At any given number of pence, shillings or pounds? To attempt to limit their right, after granting it to exist at all, is as contrary to reason--as granting it to exist at all, is contrary to justice. If they have any right to tax us--then, whether our own money shall continue in our pockets or not, depends no longer on us, but on them, 'There is nothing which 'we' can call our own; or, to use the words of Mr. Locke--what property have 'we' in that which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself?' 'These duties which will inevitably be levied upon us--which are now levying upon us--are expresly laid for the sole purpose of taking money. This is the true definition of 'taxes.' They are therefore taxes. This money is to be taken from us. We are therefore taxed. Those who are taxed without their own consent, expressed by themselves or their representatives are slaves. We are taxed without our own consent, expressed by ourselves or representatives. We are therefore slaves.' 'Further, 'Indeed nations in general are more apt to feel than to think; and therefore nations in general have lost their liberty: for as the violation of the rights of the governed are commonly not only specious, but small at the beginning, they spread over the multitude in such a manner, as to touch individuals but slightly; thus they are disregarded. The power or profit that arises from these violations, centering in a few persons, is to them considerable.""","""Colonial taxation and representation rights""","2038","""Colonial Taxation and Representation Rights  One of the key issues that fueled tensions between the American colonies and the British government in the 18th century was the question of taxation without representation. This fundamental disagreement over governmental authority and representation rights played a significant role in the lead up to the American Revolutionary War. Understanding the context of colonial taxation and representation rights sheds light on the complexities of this pivotal period in history.  The concept of """"no taxation without representation"""" encapsulated the colonists' belief that they should not be subject to taxes imposed by the British Parliament without having a say in that legislative body. The root of the issue lay in the fact that while the colonies were expected to bear the financial burdens of maintaining the British Empire through various taxes and duties, they lacked direct representation in Parliament. This disconnection between taxation and representation created a sense of injustice and alienation among the colonists.  The British government, on the other hand, viewed the colonies as integral parts of the empire that should contribute their fair share to its upkeep. In the eyes of British policymakers, Parliament represented the interests of all British subjects, regardless of whether they resided in Britain or the colonies. Therefore, the imposition of taxes such as the Stamp Act, Sugar Act, and Townshend Acts was seen as a legitimate exercise of parliamentary authority to raise revenue and regulate trade.  The Stamp Act of 1765, in particular, sparked widespread resistance in the colonies due to its direct impact on nearly all colonists through the requirement of purchasing stamped paper for various legal documents, newspapers, and licenses. The colonists saw this as a blatant violation of their economic rights and a threat to their political liberties. The ensuing protests and boycotts signaled a growing sense of unity and defiance among the colonists against British tax policies.  The British response to colonial resistance further exacerbated tensions. The deployment of British troops to enforce compliance with unpopular laws like the Quartering Act and the tightening of trade regulations only served to deepen colonial grievances. The lack of a meaningful channel for colonial voices to be heard in Parliament intensified the colonists' calls for representation and self-determination.  In response to colonial protests, the British government attempted to assert its authority by passing measures like the Coercive Acts, known to the colonists as the Intolerable Acts, which aimed to punish Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party and restrict self-governing rights in the colony. These punitive actions by the British Crown only fueled the flames of discontent and pushed the colonies closer to armed conflict.  The notion of representation was central to the colonists' demands for political rights and self-governance. The colonists sought a system where they could elect representatives who would advocate for their interests in matters of taxation, legislation, and governance. This desire for a voice in their own affairs was grounded in the ideals of democracy and liberty that were taking root in the colonies.  The issue of representation was not merely about taxation but about broader principles of freedom and self-determination. The colonists believed that they were entitled to the same rights and liberties as Englishmen living in Britain, including the right to participate in the decisions that affected their lives. The denial of this basic principle fueled a growing sense of discontent and a desire for independence from British rule.  The American Revolution marked a definitive break from British rule and the establishment of a new nation founded on the principles of representative democracy. The Declaration of Independence, with its assertion of inalienable rights and the consent of the governed, reflected the influence of the colonists' grievances over taxation and representation rights. The new American government sought to enshrine the principles of representation and popular sovereignty in its founding documents, laying the groundwork for a more inclusive and participatory form of governance.  In conclusion, the issue of colonial taxation and representation rights was a central point of contention that shaped the course of American history. The colonists' rejection of taxation without representation was not just a matter of economic burden but a fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of British rule. The quest for political rights and self-governance ultimately led to the birth of a new nation founded on the principles of democracy and individual liberty. The legacy of this struggle continues to resonate in the enduring values of representation, participation, and accountability in modern democracies.""","853"
"Shabeeny Abd Salam active 1820","""A wine company, consisting of gentlemen of practical experience in that branch of business, might form a most beneficial establishment 12 at Santa Cruz, whither the grapes of Edautenan are brought to market, and other grapes from the Arab countries, of exquisite quality and flavour, infinitely superior in richness, size, and flavour to those of Spain and Portugal, or any part of Italy; indeed, I have no hesitation in declaring, (without fear of contradiction,) that this country produces the finest grapes, oranges, and pomegranates in the world, and in the greatest abundance. I have myself tasted at Marocco, at a Hebrew Rabbi's table, excellent imitations of burgundy, claret, champagne, madeira, and rhenish, or old hock, all the produce of grapes reared in the plains of that city, and in the adjacent mountains. The port of Santa Cruz, if purchased of the Emperor by the English, would, besides securing the trade to Sudan, and the interior of Africa, supply the London market with abundance of all these excellent wines. 13 OF. Every house in Marocco has, or ought to have, a domestic serpent: I say ought to have, because those that have not one, seek to have this inmate, by treating it hospitably whenever one appears; they leave out food for it to eat during the night, which gradually domiciliates this reptile. These serpents are reported to be extremely sagacious, and very susceptible. The superstition of these people is extraordinary; for rather than offend these serpents, they will suffer their women to be exposed during sleep to their performing the office of an infant. They are considered, in a house, emblematical of good, or prosperity, as their absence is ominous of evil. They are not often visible; but I have seen them passing over the beams of the roof of the apartments. A friend of mine was just retired to bed at Marocco, when he heard a noise in the room, like something crawling over his head, he arose, looked about the room, and discovered one of these reptiles about four feet long, of a dark colour, he pricked it with his sword, and killed it, then returned to bed. In the morning he called to him the master of the house where he was a guest, and telling him he had attacked the serpent, the Jew was chagrined, and expostulated with him, for the injury he had done him: apprehensive that evil would visit him, he intimated to his guest, that he hoped he would leave his house, as he feared the malignity of the serpent; and he was not reconciled until my friend discovered to him that he had actually killed the reptile. 14 OF FAS. Superior Manufacture of Gold-thread.--Imitation of precious Stones.--Manufactory of Gun-barrels in Suse.--Silver-mine. The manufactures of West Barbary, are of various kinds. They excel, in the city of Fas, in the manufacture of woollens, cottons, silks, and gold-thread. The wool and cotton are made into hayks, which are pieces of cloth five feet wide, and about three and a half, or four yards long, used to throw loosely over the dress, when they go out into the external air: it resembles the Roman toga, and when tastefully adjusted, gives an elegance to the Moorish costume. These hayks are manufactured in most of the private families of Fas; the women employ themselves about them, and sell them to the merchants. They are sometimes made of cotton mixed with silk, and also altogether of silk. They make also pieces of silk of various bright colours, called bulawan; the sky-blue, dark-blue, scarlet, and yellow, are vivid colours, produced by their mode of dying the silk before it is manufactured. They manufacture their silks from Bengal raw silk, which they call emfitla. The bulawan is 15/8 striped, or chequered, pink, blue, yellow, scarlet, and green: it resembles what is called, in England, Persian, but it is much stronger, and more durable, though equally light. The silk sashes, called hazam, are made in large quantities, and are deserving of imitation in Europe; they are very substantial, but of the same superior colours with the bulawan. They are made generally half a yard wide, and three yards long: these sell at Fas, from two to fifty dollars each. The superior kind made for the ladies of the horam, or emperor's seraglio, for the ladies of the bashaws, and for those of the great and opulent, are intermixed with a beautiful gold-thread, much superior to any that is manufactured in Europe, insomuch, that the gold-thread imported from Leghorn and Marseilles is used only in such hazams as are made for exportation to Sudan, Draha, or Bled-el-Jereed, but those made for the great and opulent, for home consumption, are manufactured with the gold thread of the Fas manufacture. Whether these expert artificers learned the mystery of gold beating, and gold wire drawing, by which they obtain gold-thread, from the 16 Egyptians, I am not competent to say; but they say they derived it in ancient times from the Arabs, as well as the art of cutting, polishing, and setting precious stones. They make a composition in imitation of amber, which cannot, by the keenest eye, be distinguished from the natural amber, the latter, however, by friction attracts cotton, but the manufactured amber does not; this is the only criterion by which they ascertain the true from the false amber. They also compose artificial stones with equal sagacity; the topaz, the emerald, and the ruby they imitate to perfection. The wool with which they make shawls almost equal in appearance to those of Kashmere, is procured from the sheep of the province of Tedla, and is finer than the Spanish Merino. They might manufacture shawls of goats' hair, equal to those of Kashmere, from the goats of the eastern declivity of the Atlas, whose hair is like silk: these goats are.e. Tafilelt goats. There can be no doubt, if our intercourse with Marocco 17 had not been impeded by a general ignorance of the language of that country, that we might long since have received from the manufacturers of Fas, shawls of Tafilelt goat-hair, equal to the finest of the Kashmere manufacture. There is a very extensive manufactory of red woollen caps at Fas, the contexture of which is well deserving investigation. There is also a manufactory of gun locks and barrels; the former appear to have reached the acme of the art, the latter are not so good as those which they procure from Europe: so that a Spanish or an English barrel, and a Fas lock, is considered a complete gun. Such articles of manufacture as require a complication of machinery and power to produce they import from Europe, except only when the market is bare, and then necessity compels them to attempt their construction..e. Tafilelt hayk, is a fine elegant woollen cloth, thin as a muslin. The Emperor Seedi Muhamed ben Abdallah patronised this manufacture of his native country, and never wore any other. The art of manufacturing leather is carried to great perfection at Mequinas: shoes of the thinnest leather are there made impervious to water. The manufactures at Marocco and Terodant are similar to those of Fas, with the exception of that of gold-thread, and the cutting and polishing of precious stones. The preparation of leather at Marocco surpasses any thing known in Europe: lion and tiger skins they prepare white as snow, and soft as silk. There are 18 two plants that grow in the Atlas mountains, the leaves of which they use in the manufacture of leather; they are called tizra, and tasaya. Whether these render the leather impervious, I am not competent to say; every inquiry that I have made at Marocco respecting this beautiful manufacture, has been unsatisfactory. I have always found the manufacturers very guarded, and extremely jealous; but I have often thought that two or three of our leather manufacturers, well versed in their art, and withal of penetrating minds, might contrive to extract the secret from them. In the mountains of Idaultit, in Lower Suse, they have iron-mines, and they make gun-barrels and gun-locks equal to what are made at Fas. The temptations to agriculture, however, are such, that sufficient only for the consumption of their own kabyl are manufactured; which is done rather from a principle of self-defense, and from the amor patri, than with a view to gain. The silver from the mines of Elala, comes to the Santa Cruz market pure, and in round lumps, weighing about two ounces each. I have bought it for its weight in Spanish dollars; but it is generally taken to the Mint for sale. Ores of gold from the mines of South Barbary, and silver dust from the bed of the river at Messa, collected personally by me, I sent to England to be assayed: the person who got them assayed, reported, that the metal yielded was scarcely sufficient to pay the charges of assaying; so that the speculation was abandoned., amber.

La Beaume, p. 9.] [Footnote 5/89:""","""Wine production and local agriculture.""","1991","""Wine production is a fascinating blend of art, science, and agriculture. The process of cultivating wine grapes and transforming them into the fine wines that grace our tables involves a deep appreciation for the land, an understanding of viticulture, and a respect for tradition. Local agriculture plays a crucial role in wine production, influencing the quality, character, and sustainability of the final product.  In the world of wine, the concept of terroir is paramount. Terroir refers to the unique combination of soil, climate, topography, and human influence that gives each wine region its distinctive characteristics. Local agriculture directly impacts the terroir of a vineyard, shaping the flavors and aromas of the wine it produces. Farmers who practice sustainable agriculture contribute to the health of the soil and the surrounding ecosystem, ultimately enhancing the quality of the grapes grown.  Vineyard management is a year-round endeavor that requires careful attention to detail. From pruning and trellising in the winter to canopy management and pest control in the summer, every season brings its own set of tasks and challenges. Local farmers must be attuned to the specific needs of their vineyards, adjusting their practices based on factors like soil composition, microclimate variations, and grape varietals.  Harvest season is a highlight of the wine production process, as grapes reach peak ripeness and are ready to be picked. Local agricultural workers, often assisted by seasonal laborers, meticulously hand-harvest the grapes to ensure that only the best fruit makes its way to the winery. This human touch is crucial in maintaining the quality and integrity of the grapes, as mechanical harvesting can damage the vines and compromise the final product.  Once the grapes are harvested, they embark on a journey that will ultimately lead to the creation of wine. The process of winemaking involves crushing the grapes, fermenting the juice, aging the wine in barrels or tanks, and bottling the final product. Throughout this process, the skills of the winemaker are complemented by the hard work of local farmers who dedicate themselves to producing top-quality grapes.  Local agriculture not only influences the quality of wine but also plays a significant role in preserving the environment and supporting the community. Sustainable farming practices such as cover cropping, composting, and integrated pest management help reduce the reliance on chemicals, conserve water, and promote biodiversity. Moreover, vineyards often serve as habitats for various flora and fauna, contributing to the overall ecological balance of the region.  In addition to environmental stewardship, local agriculture fosters a sense of place and heritage within the wine industry. Family-owned vineyards that have been passed down through generations carry with them a legacy of craftsmanship and tradition. By supporting local farmers and wineries, consumers can connect with the stories behind the wines they enjoy, deepening their appreciation for the artistry and dedication that goes into each bottle.  The relationship between wine production and local agriculture is symbiotic, with each benefiting from the other's success. As demand for sustainably produced wines continues to grow, the role of local farmers in shaping the future of the wine industry becomes increasingly significant. By prioritizing environmental stewardship, quality craftsmanship, and community engagement, both wine producers and farmers can work together to ensure a thriving and vibrant agricultural landscape for future generations to enjoy.""","658"
"Francis John George","""They are simply shoots and ramifications of a metal, as iron or manganese. Those in the weed-agate of India, which exactly resemble sprays of fine sea-weed, are produced by delessite. Indeed, it is both diverting and instructive to observe how Nature permits, and even seems to abound in, curious coincidences and striking resemblances between things of entirely diverse character. The dried polyp, called encrinoid echinoderm, bears a wonderful likeness to one species of Indian corn. (See the plate at p. 37 of Mr. Rymer Joness beautiful work on The Animal Kingdom. ) And the other day, when I was enjoying a leisure hour in the British Museum, I suddenly remarked that the the splendid fossil specimen of the Holoptychius nobilissimus in one of the cases might serve for a sketch of the back of a capercailzie, where the grey and purple feathers overlap one another. Yet here is no real connection whatever. Only Dame Nature had gone to play. Secondly. The preservation of these polyp forms, in the manner in which they have been preserved, seems to me to be due to a feature or circumstance which is strictly animal and not vegetable. I refer to the fact of the creature, while it was alive, inhabiting a house, a house built by himself, or emanating from his own substance. For, just as we could know but little of the existence or habits of shell-fish, were it not for their shells, so I think we may assume that the choanite must, when alive, have dwelt in a tough, horny coperculum, answering to the shape of his body and the number of his that calcareous matter of which these tubes and plates were formed, when once it has been subjected to processes of infiltration by crystallizing mineral and metallic oxides. Now, I think this argument a very strong one; in fact, although simple, almost unanswerable. For no plant dwells thus in a house. We have the plant itself, but nothing more; and if this be not capable, and I hold it to be incapable, of sustaining the most vehement mineralizing process in the crucible of Nature, its history must be a brief one, and excepting in the dark lithographs of the coal-measures, its memory must pass away. I have already allowed an exceptionable case in favour of the conifers, which, be it observed, nowise resemble anything portrayed in siliceous pebbles, and it is remarkable how much this class of plants predominates in the COAL. I have always been suspicious of what are called vegetable petrifactions. I examined those at Tivoli, near Rome, in the year 845/8, and I made up my mind that they are simple incrustations. In like manner, many of the buildings at Pstum are constructed with a kind of travertine taken from the bed of a neighbouring river, and which rapidly incrusts any solid objects submitted to the action of its waters. But the truth is, the vegetable pipe or straw remains for a while, owing to the silex which entered into its composition while the plant was growing. After some years the straw decays, and there is a hole or depression in that part of the pillar or pediment. On the other hand, a calcareous menstruum, imbibing silex and iron, hardens into a substance which, like the best mortar or cement used in building, will sometimes outlast even the blocks of limestone or oolite which it was put to bind together. Thirdly. Animal organization, such even as these polyps possessed, renders the phenomena much more intelligible. Our best authorities in such matters tell us that insects have neither lungs nor branchi; but in them the air passes into a system of tubes, whose structure resembles that of an elastic webbing. And again, The annelids possess an uninterrupted circulation. And again, In the Nymphon and Pycnogonum molluscs, which are crustaceans having considerable resemblance to certain of our field spiders, the intestine penetrates to the very extremities of the feet and claws. Animal Kingdom. Now here are cited some of the very desiderata which I should have named, had I been asked what conditions were needed a priori for such petrifactions to occur. I will only add, under this head, that a fine annelid occurs in the blue agate off Eastbourne; that a myriapod, which is among the chromo plates of this volume, has all the characteristics of insect life and motion; and that a spider is the nearest thing I know of, in some respects, to what the choanite must have been when that mollusc condensed himself from a cylinder to a sphere. Perhaps, however, the strongest clause in this part of the argument may be drawn from the sponges. Here the creature itself, wonderful to relate, is a viscous fluid, and the intricate mansion which he inhabits is a globose, horny skeleton, perforated with endless small tubes opening into wider galleries. There was, however, in the perfect animal, I am assured, one main central cavity, which gave strength and unity to the entire fabric by the plan of its walls, and, perhaps, by a main valve. Throughout the whole of this hydraulic system the sea-water, on the circulation of which the zoophyte depended for life and health, could be pumped to and fro at pleasure. And, evidently, when the habitat of such a creature was suddenly invaded by a siliceous crystalline solution, extinction of the animal and a petrifying investment of his abode would be simultaneous. Lastly. If the objects here petrified had been vegetable in their extraction, should we not, with the aid of the microscope, be able to identify them? But this I have never yet succeeded in doing; yet all the petrified woods are well known. I have myself obtained slabs of the acacia from the coast of South Devon; of the beech, in Sussex; of coniferous wood almost everywhere. And, what is more to the purpose, though the petrifaction in such cases is deep and perfect, no one looking upon it could doubt for a moment that the original structure had been that of wood from a forest-tree. Agatized as it is, and penetrated here and there by metallic colours, and shot with rays of jasper, the lines in its fabric reveal the texture of wood. I may mention here, that every one who walks our beaches, with a view to the collection of fossil specimens, will do well to carry in his or her pocket a good lens, of large external diameter; mine measures about two inches across, and I may truly say it has saved me a world of trouble, besides affording me much satisfaction at odd moments in the scrutiny of pebbles of different kinds and textures. Before closing this chapter I may be permitted to draw the readers attention to a theory held by the late Dr. Mantell. I cannot, at this moment, lay my hand upon the volume in which it occurs, but I am pretty sure it will be found in his Geology of the Isle of Wight: a book which, for elegance of composition, and sound information, can hardly be too much commended; though a resident lapidary in Sandown did once say to me, while thumbing the pages of a well-worn copy, Ah, sir! if the Doctor had come here and stayed a week instead of listening only to what those fellows told him in Ryde, I could have shown him something which he doesnt seem to know, as to how the bit of coast runs hereabouts. Dr. Mantells idea was this: he held that when a mollusc was subjected to the first stage in the petrifying process, there was, in the dying of the creature, some effusion of blood (or quasi-blood), and that this, being the very pith and strength of the animals system, would, in many cases, tinge the future stone indelibly. He carried this notion so far as to assign some dark blotches, apparent in the masonry of a wall, to such a source as being their most probable cause; and he gave to the thing itself the graphic title of Molluskite. In this view I will only add that I am inclined to agree with him; and in my myriapod, already referred to, there is a blood-red spot which pierces through the stone, appearing on both sides, and which I at first supposed to be a piece of shell-lac, but I now rather regard it as the trace left of himself by some marauding pholas, who, after drilling a hole through the solid pebble, found his own grave there.

Petrification occurs through the replacement of organic materials with minerals, resulting in the formation of a rock-like replica of the original organism. Fossilization involves the preservation of organic remains in sedimentary rock over millions of years, offering insights into past life forms, environments, and evolutionary processes.  The petrification process begins when an organism dies and is quickly buried under layers of sediment, safeguarding it from decay and scavengers. Over time, groundwater rich in minerals seeps through the sediment and permeates the organism's tissues. The minerals gradually replace the original organic materials, such as bones, shells, or wood, turning them into stone-like structures. This mineral replacement process often retains the organism's form and intricate details, making petrified specimens visually striking and scientifically significant.  One prominent example of petrification is the transformation of wood into petrified wood. When a tree falls into water-logged sediments or volcanic ash, it becomes buried and protected from decomposition by oxygen and microbes. Groundwater, carrying minerals like silica, iron, or calcite, gradually infiltrates the wood's cellular structure, replacing the organic components with minerals. The resulting petrified wood exhibits the original tree's growth rings, bark patterns, and even microscopic details, providing valuable insights into ancient forests and past climates.  Fossilization, on the other hand, involves the preservation of organic remains in sedimentary rock over geologic timescales. The process typically starts with the rapid burial of an organism in sediment, preventing its immediate decomposition. Over time, the sediment layers accumulate and compress the organic material, gradually turning it into a fossil. Through various fossilization methods like permineralization, compression, and replacement, the organism's remains can be preserved in different forms, ranging from bones and teeth to shells and imprints.  Permineralization is a common fossilization process where minerals fill in the pore spaces of organic materials, creating a hardened cast of the original specimen. This method is often seen in the preservation of dinosaur bones, where minerals like calcite or silica infuse the bone structure, solidifying it into a fossil. Compression fossilization occurs when the weight of overlying sediments squeezes out water and gases from the buried organism, leaving behind a flattened impression in the rock, such as leaf fossils found in shale layers. Replacement fossilization involves the complete dissolution of the original organic material and its substitution with minerals, resulting in a fossil that retains the original shape and texture of the organism.  Fossilization provides invaluable insights into Earth's past, offering glimpses into ancient ecosystems, climate conditions, and evolutionary processes. By studying fossils, paleontologists can reconstruct long-extinct species, understand their behaviors, and track evolutionary changes over millions of years. Fossils also help us decipher past environmental conditions, such as ancient sea levels, temperatures, and habitats, informing our understanding of how life on Earth has evolved and adapted to changing landscapes.  The study of petrification and fossilization not only sheds light on Earth's history but also aids in understanding current ecological trends and predicting future environmental changes. By unraveling the mysteries preserved in ancient rocks and petrified remains, scientists and researchers can piece together the puzzle of life's evolution and the planet's geological transformations. From petrified forests to dinosaur fossils, these relics of the past serve as time capsules, offering a window into worlds long gone and inspiring awe at the wonders of the natural world.  In conclusion, petrification and fossilization are intricate processes that capture and preserve the remnants of past life forms, allowing us to unravel the mysteries of Earth's ancient history. Through the transformation of organic materials into stone-like structures and the preservation of organisms in sedimentary rock, petrification and fossilization provide a glimpse into the rich tapestry of life that has inhabited our planet over millions of years. By studying these petrified relics, we gain valuable insights into the evolution of life, the changing landscapes of Earth, and the interconnectedness of all living beings throughout geologic time.""","842"
"Kellner K A Heinrich Karl Adam Heinrich ","""There can have been no ecclesiastical tradition concerning the date of the Nativity, since in the earliest times it was commemorated by no special festival. The Epiphany, which commemorated several events, took the place of such a festival. These are the difficulties which stand in the way of accepting the 5/8th December as the actual date of the Nativity, and they must be taken into account by any one who desires to form a judgment for himself on this matter. The other questions relating to the same point are more easily disposed of. Whether the accepted date is correct or not, we find it definitely set down by the chronographer of 5/84, who directly states that Christ was born on the 5/8th forth her child and in the presence of many of Gods hand-maidens who strove for thy companionship,, Thou hast desired excellent espousals, my daughter. Thou seest what a crowd of people have come together to celebrate the birth-day of thy Bridegroom, and that no one goes away from hence unnourished. He it is who, when invited to the marriage, changed water into wine. He will vouchsafe the true secrets of virginity to thee, who until now hast been subject to the beggarly elements of nature. He it is who, with five loaves and two fishes, satisfied four thousand men in the wilderness. He could have satisfied more had more been there. Finally, He has invited still more to thine espousals, not to give them barley-bread, but a Body from heaven. Liberius here represents taking the vows of religion under the familiar figure of a marriage. The marriage feast always forms part of every marriage, and accordingly it was the duty of the Bridegroom whom Marcellina had chosen to provide one. He had changed water into wine and fed thousands with a few loaves, but now He feeds a still greater number with His mystical Body in the Holy Eucharist. This is the thought running through the Popes address. St Ambrose does not inform us of the year in which the ceremony took place at which Liberius spoke the above words. Liberius had been elected bishop of troublous times under the Emperor Constantius, a strong Arian. As he refused to communicate with the Eusebius and protected St Athanasius, he was banished to Bera at the end of 5/85/8, where he was compelled to remain until 5/87. The Archdeacon Felix, relying on the Emperors support, allowed himself to be consecrated bishop in his stead, but found no following in Rome. On this account, Constantius consented to the recall of the lawful bishop, and Liberius resided in Rome for the remainder of his pontificate, and died there in 66. It is more probable that Marcellinas clothing with the religious habit took place during the latter part of this pontificate. For according to the received opinion, St Ambrose was born about the year 40, and thus in 5/83 he would have been only thirteen years old, and although his sister was older, yet in 5/83 she would not have been twenty-five, the canonical age for taking the veil. Still it is not impossible that the ceremony and the address of Liberius took place between 5/82 and 5/84, and at any rate this much is certain that it took place on the 5/8th December and not on the the revolution in the spiritual sphere (Christs nativity), was sufficient to suggest the idea. It was not necessary to wait for the time of Constantine in order to hit upon this idea. We must now return once more to the usages of the Church of Jerusalem and the festival observed there. The th January, indeed, was called in Jerusalem Epiphany, nevertheless the nativity of Christ formed an especially prominent feature of the commemoration. A detailed description of the function is given in Silvias diary. Unfortunately the beginning is missing, and the account opens with the return of the great procession which took place annually from Jerusalem to Bethlehem the evening before the feast. The next morning, the procession returned to Jerusalem and proceeded to the Church of the Anastasis, which was richly decorated. The monks remained all night in the church at Bethlehem, which, all through the octave, remained in festal array. A procession to Bethlehem, on the Epiphany would have no meaning, if the baptism of Christ was the only event commemorated at that feast, for this, of course, took place in the Jordan. In Jerusalem, as in the other Eastern Churches, no special Christmas festival had been as yet instituted, still at the commencement of the fifth century there were some who regarded the Epiphany as the day of Christs nativity in the flesh, although, as St Jerome says, the Son of God did not reveal Himself in flesh but rather concealed Himself. Indeed, if we are to believe Cosmas Indicopleustes, who lived in the middle of the sixth century, the nativity of Christ was commemorated at Jerusalem, and there only on the Epiphany a superstitious fancy, as he calls it. On the other hand, it has been stated that Bishop Juvenal (25/8-5/88), who obtained for the Church of Jerusalem patriarchal rank, introduced the feast of Christs birth.""","""Date of Christ's Nativity Celebration""","1115","""The celebration of the Nativity of Christ has been a cornerstone of Christian tradition and worship for centuries. The precise date of Christ's birth has been a subject of debate among scholars and theologians throughout history. While December 25th is widely recognized as the date of Christ's Nativity in many Christian denominations, the actual historical evidence supporting this specific date is ambiguous.  The choice of December 25th as the date to celebrate Christ's birth can be traced back to the early Christian Church's efforts to co-opt and Christianize existing pagan festivals. In the Roman Empire, the festival of Saturnalia, a time of feasting and merriment in honor of the god Saturn, was observed around the winter solstice. By aligning the celebration of Christ's birth with existing pagan festivities, early Christian leaders sought to attract more converts and provide a Christian alternative to the popular pagan customs.  Another significant influence on the selection of December 25th as the date of Christ's Nativity was the belief that the Annunciation, when the angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would conceive the Son of God, occurred on March 25th. Early Christians calculated that Christ would have been conceived on that day, with his birth then taking place nine months later on December 25th.  Despite the widespread acceptance of December 25th as the date of Christ's birth, some scholars propose alternative theories. One theory suggests that Jesus was actually born in the spring, based on biblical references to shepherds tending their flocks at night, a practice more common in the warmer months. Others point to historical records indicating that Emperor Constantine may have influenced the selection of December 25th for political or strategic reasons.  In Eastern Orthodox traditions, the Nativity of Christ is observed on January 7th due to differences in the calendar systems used by Eastern and Western churches. The Julian calendar, which the Eastern Orthodox Church follows, lags behind the Gregorian calendar by 13 days, resulting in the variation in dates for Christmas celebrations.  Regardless of the specific date chosen for the celebration, the Nativity of Christ holds deep spiritual significance for Christians around the world. It serves as a time to reflect on the mystery of the Incarnation, the belief that God became human in the form of Jesus Christ. The birth of Christ symbolizes hope, peace, and salvation for believers, emphasizing the central message of love and redemption that forms the core of the Christian faith.  In contemporary society, the celebration of Christmas has evolved to encompass a mix of religious and secular customs, including exchanging gifts, decorating trees, and gathering with loved ones. While the historical accuracy of December 25th as the date of Christ's birth may continue to be debated, the essence of the Nativity story endures as a unifying and inspirational narrative that transcends time and culture. As Christians worldwide come together to commemorate the birth of Jesus each year, the universal themes of compassion, generosity, and goodwill resonate across diverse traditions and beliefs, fostering a spirit of unity and joy during the holiday season.""","612"
"Swinburne Algernon Charles","""That Hamlet should seem at times to accept for himself, and even to enforce by reiteration of argument upon his conscience and his reason, some such conviction or suspicion as to his own character, tells much rather in disfavour than in favour of its truth. A man whose natural temptation was to swerve, whose inborn inclination was to shrink and skulk aside from duty and from action, would hardly be the first and last person to suspect his own weakness, the one only unbiassed judge and witness of sufficiently sharp-sighted candour and accuracy to estimate aright his poverty of nature and the malformation of his mind. But the high-hearted and tender-conscienced Hamlet, with his native bias towards introspection intensified and inflamed and directed and dilated at once by one imperative pressure and oppression of unavoidable and unalterable circumstance, was assuredly and exactly the one only man to be troubled by any momentary fear that such might indeed be the solution of his riddle, and to feel or to fancy for the moment some kind of ease and relief in the sense of that very trouble. A born doubter would have doubted even of Horatio; hardly can all positive and almost palpable evidence of underhand instigation and inspired good intentions induce Hamlet for some time to doubt even of Ophelia. III. The entrance to the third period of Shakespeare is like the entrance to that lost and lesser Paradise of old, With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms. Lear, Othello, Macbeth, Coriolanus, Antony, Timon, these are names indeed of something more than tragic purport. Only in the sunnier distance beyond, where the sunset of Shakespeare's imagination seems to melt or flow back into the sunrise, do we discern Prospero beside Miranda, Florizel by Perdita, Palamon with Arcite, the same knightly and kindly Duke Theseus as of old; and above them all, and all others of his divine and human children, the crowning and final and ineffable figure of Imogen. Of all Shakespeare's plays, King Lear is unquestionably that in which he has come nearest to the height and to the likeness of the one tragic poet on any side greater than himself whom the world in all its ages has ever seen born of time. It is by far the most AEschylean of his works; the most elemental and primaeval, the most oceanic and Titanic in conception. He deals here with no subtleties as in Hamlet, with no conventions as in Othello: there is no question of 'a divided duty' or a problem half insoluble, a matter of country and connection, of family or of race; we look upward and downward, and in vain, into the deepest things of nature, into the highest things of providence; to the roots of life, and to the stars; from the roots that no God waters to the stars which give no man light; over a world full of death and life without resting-place or guidance. But in one main point it differs radically from the work and the spirit of AEschylus. Its fatalism is of a darker and harder nature. To Prometheus the fetters of the lord and enemy of mankind were bitter; upon Orestes the hand of heaven was laid too heavily to bear; yet in the not utterly infinite or everlasting distance we see beyond them the promise of the morning on which mystery and justice shall be made one; when righteousness and omnipotence at last shall kiss each other. But on the horizon of Shakespeare's tragic fatalism we see no such twilight of atonement, such pledge of reconciliation as this. Requital, redemption, amends, equity, explanation, pity and mercy, are words without a meaning here. As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; They kill us for their sport. Here is no need of the Eumenides, children of Night everlasting; for here is very Night herself. The words just cited are not casual or episodical; they strike the keynote of the whole poem, lay the keystone of the whole arch of thought. There is no contest of conflicting forces, no judgment so much as by casting of lots: far less is there any light of heavenly harmony or of heavenly wisdom, of Apollo or Athene from above. We have heard much and often from theologians of the light of revelation: and some such thing indeed we find in AEschylus: but the darkness of revelation is here. For in this the most terrible work of human genius it is with the very springs and sources of nature that her student has set himself to deal. The veil of the temple of our humanity is rent in twain. Nature herself, we might say, is revealed--and revealed as unnatural. In face of such a world as this a man might be forgiven who should pray that chaos might come again. Nowhere else in Shakespeare's work or in the universe of jarring lives are the lines of character and event so broadly drawn or so sharply cut. Only the supreme self-command of this one poet could so mould and handle such types as to restrain and prevent their passing from the abnormal into the monstrous: yet even as much as this, at least in all cases but one, it surely has accomplished. In Regan alone would it be, I think, impossible to find a touch or trace of anything less vile than it was devilish. Even Goneril has her one splendid hour, her fire- flaught of hellish glory; when she treads under foot the half-hearted goodness, the wordy and windy though sincere abhorrence, which is all that the mild and impotent revolt of Albany can bring to bear against her imperious and dauntless devilhood; when she flaunts before the eyes of her 'milk-livered' and 'moral fool' the coming banners of France about the 'plumed helm' of his slayer. On the other side, Kent is the exception which answers to Regan on this. Cordelia, the brotherless Antigone of our stage, has one passing touch of intolerance for what her sister was afterwards to brand as indiscretion and dotage in their father, which redeems her from the charge of perfection. Like Imogen, she is not too inhumanly divine for the sense of divine irritation. Godlike though they be, their very godhead is human and feminine; and only therefore credible, and only therefore adorable. Cloten and Regan, Goneril and Iachimo, have power to stir and embitter the sweetness of their blood. But for the contrast and even the contact of antagonists as abominable as these, the gold of their spirit would be too refined, the lily of their holiness too radiant, the violet of their virtue too sweet. As it is, Shakespeare has gone down perforce among the blackest and the basest things of nature to find anything so equally exceptional in evil as properly to counterbalance and make bearable the excellence and extremity of their goodness. No otherwise could either angel have escaped the blame implied in the very attribute and epithet of blameless. But where the possible depth of human hell is so foul and unfathomable as it appears in the spirits which serve as foils to these, we may endure that in them the inner height of heaven should be no less immaculate and immeasurable. It should be a truism wellnigh as musty as Hamlet's half cited proverb, to enlarge upon the evidence given in King Lear of a sympathy with the mass of social misery more wide and deep and direct and bitter and tender than Shakespeare has shown elsewhere. But as even to this day and even in respectable quarters the murmur is not quite duly extinct which would charge on Shakespeare a certain share of divine indifference to suffering, of godlike satisfaction and a less than compassionate content, it is not yet perhaps utterly superfluous to insist on the utter fallacy and falsity of their creed who whether in praise or in blame would rank him to his credit or discredit among such poets as on this side at least may be classed rather with Goethe than with Shelley and with Gautier than with Hugo. A poet of revolution he is not, as none of his country in that generation could have been: but as surely as the author of Julius Caesar has approved himself in the best and highest sense of the word at least potentially a republican, so surely has the author of King Lear avowed himself in the only good and rational sense of the words a spiritual if not a political democrat and socialist. It is only, I think, in this most tragic of tragedies that the sovereign lord and incarnate god of pity and terror can be said to have struck with all his strength a chord of which the resonance could excite such angry agony and heartbreak of wrath as that of the brother kings when they smote their staffs against the ground in fierce imperious anguish of agonised and rebellious compassion, at the oracular cry of Calchas for the innocent blood of Iphigenia. The doom even of Desdemona seems as much less morally intolerable as it is more logically inevitable than the doom of Cordelia. But doubtless the fatalism of Othello is as much darker and harder than that of any third among the plays of Shakespeare, as it is less dark and hard than the fatalism of King Lear. For upon the head of the very noblest man whom even omnipotence or Shakespeare could ever call to life he has laid a burden in one sense yet heavier than the burden of Lear, insomuch as the sufferer can with somewhat less confidence of universal appeal proclaim himself a man more sinned against than sinning. And yet, if ever man after Lear might lift up his voice in that protest, it would assuredly be none other than Othello.""","""Shakespeare's Tragedies and Human Nature""","2021","""Shakespeare's tragedies stand as timeless masterpieces that delve deep into the complex intricacies of human nature. Through his portrayal of flawed characters and their fatal flaws, Shakespeare reflects the essence of humanity in all its glory and darkness. These tragedies resonate with audiences across centuries because they capture the essence of what it means to be human - the struggles, passions, ambitions, and moral dilemmas that define us.   In works like """"Hamlet,"""" """"Macbeth,"""" """"Othello,"""" and """"King Lear,"""" Shakespeare explores the depths of human character with remarkable insight and empathy. One of the central themes in these tragedies is the human capacity for both good and evil. Shakespeare's characters often grapple with conflicting emotions and desires, showcasing the complexity of human nature. Hamlet's indecision, Macbeth's ambition, Othello's jealousy, and Lear's pride all reveal different facets of the human psyche.  Tragedy, as a genre, allows Shakespeare to explore the darker aspects of human nature. It serves as a mirror held up to society, reflecting its flaws, injustices, and moral failings. Through the downfall of his tragic heroes, Shakespeare highlights universal themes such as power, betrayal, revenge, love, and the nature of existence. These plays force audiences to confront uncomfortable truths about themselves and the world around them.  Central to Shakespeare's tragedies is the concept of hubris - excessive pride or self-confidence. Many of his tragic heroes fall victim to their own hubris, leading to their eventual downfall. This hubris stems from their overestimation of their own abilities or from a fatal flaw in their character. Macbeth's unchecked ambition, Lear's misguided sense of power, and Othello's insecurity all contribute to their tragic fates. Through these characters, Shakespeare warns against the dangers of unchecked ego and the consequences of ignoring one's moral compass.  The exploration of human nature in Shakespeare's tragedies is also closely intertwined with the concept of fate versus free will. While some characters succumb to their predetermined destinies, others have the agency to make choices that ultimately seal their fates. This dynamic tension between fate and free will adds another layer of complexity to Shakespeare's portrayal of human nature. It raises profound questions about the nature of choice, responsibility, and the role of external forces in shaping our lives.  Moreover, Shakespeare's tragedies are replete with moral ambiguity, blurring the lines between right and wrong. Characters like Iago in """"Othello"""" or Lady Macbeth in """"Macbeth"""" challenge conventional notions of morality, forcing audiences to confront the darker shades of human behavior. These morally complex characters serve as a reminder that human nature is not confined to simple binaries of good and evil but exists in a nuanced spectrum of motives and actions.  The enduring appeal of Shakespeare's tragedies lies in their profound insights into the human condition. By depicting characters who wrestle with their inner demons, face moral dilemmas, and confront the consequences of their choices, Shakespeare invites audiences to contemplate the universal struggles of existence. These tragedies serve as cautionary tales, reminding us of the fragility of human nature and the consequences of giving in to our baser instincts.  In conclusion, Shakespeare's tragedies offer a profound exploration of human nature that continues to captivate audiences worldwide. Through his memorable characters, intricate plots, and timeless themes, Shakespeare reveals the full range of human emotions, desires, and vulnerabilities. His tragedies serve as a testament to the enduring complexity of the human experience and the perennial relevance of his insights into the depths of our souls.""","711"
"Hill Georgiana","""It is, says Lloyd, the happiness of foreigners that their vocations are suited to their natures, and that their education seconds their inclination, and both byass and ground do wonders. It is to the unhappiness of Englishmen that they are bred rather according to their estates than their temper; and great parts have been lost, while their calling drew one away and their genius another. Sir Anthony seems to have known how to suit his childrens education to their temper, which was keenly studious. He was excessively careful to set them a good example. My example is your inheritance, and my life is your portion, he wrote to his eldest daughter. All his daughters were good classical scholars, could correspond in Greek, and were excellent translators. Sir Thomas Mores daughters were educated in a similar way. Margaret, wife of William Roper and her fathers favourite, is the most celebrated; but all were clever, studious women, not content with light and easy studies, but attaining great proficiency in abstruse subjects. Jane Countess of Westmoreland, whose father was the famous Fox the martyrologist, was said to be able to bear comparison with the greatest scholars of the age. The three daughters of Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, were much distinguished for their Latin distichs, and it was said of them that if Orpheus could have heard them he would have become their scholar. Mary Sidney, afterwards Countess of Pembroke, sister of the famous Sir Philip Sidney, was one of the most intellectual women of her age. In the retirement of the fine old family mansion at Penshurst Place, Kent, she passed a studious, happy girlhood. The companionship of her gifted brother, and association with such men as the poet Spenser, no doubt fostered her innate love of learning. By the great poet she has been celebrated as-- The gentlest shepherdess that livd that day, And most resembling in shape and spirit Her brother dear. Together with her brother she wrote a version of the Psalms, and on her own account a poem in celebration of Queen Elizabeth. As a centre of intellectual thought and literary life, Mary Sidney, when, in 5/876, she became the wife of Henry Earl of Pembroke, and mistress of his establishment at Wilton, may be compared with Lady Holland or Lady Blessington. Poets and statesmen gathered at her hospitable board, for at Wilton Place a stately magnificence was maintained. Had the Countess of Pembroke been merely a lady of rank, she would not have left her mark on an age when there were so many illustrious names. But her cultivation of mind made her the fit companion of the greatest intellects of the day. It is no small thing to have entertained Shakespeare, to have had Ben Jonson as a familiar guest, besides lesser poets such as Massinger and Daniel, a poet laureate of Elizabethan days, who was a great admirer of her talents. Sir Philip Sidney was much attached to his distinguished sister, to whom he dedicated his Arcadia. It was a grief to both that in after-life they were so much separated. Dr. Donne, another poet, but more eminent as a divine, was a friend whom Mary Sidney much esteemed. It was less for what she did than for what she was that Mary Sidney is celebrated. Her great nobility of character made her pre-eminent, and her influence on her contemporaries was very marked. There was no affectation of ignorance among the learned women of the sixteenth century. Learning among women was held in esteem. It was not thought unfeminine to speak good Latin, write correct Greek, or translate from Hebrew. Unusual and extraordinary it was undoubtedly deemed for women to show fine scholarship, but it was an unusual and extraordinary merit. The absurd notion that the acquisition of knowledge, or intellectual ability, are things to be ashamed of, was one of the base products of eighteenth-century sentimentalism. When we think of the great difficulties in the way of learning in the sixteenth century, we cannot but wonder at the assiduity and patience of the scholars of that period, both men and women. There were no primers, exercise-books, or well-printed dictionaries of the classical languages into English. Grammars were scarce, and were sometimes composed by the tutors for their pupils. There were no carefully prepared passages for translation with notes and explanations. The scholar had to go straight to the original, and ferret out the meaning unaided. Latin was the common medium of communication between scholars and the polite world generally. At a time when every one with any pretensions to education understood Latin, the standard of good scholarship must have been fairly high, and when we find the daughters of Sir Anthony Coke and Sir Thomas More, and other ladies, commended for their pure Latin, we feel that the encomium was well deserved, as a moderate degree of proficiency would not have attracted notice. The learned ladies of the sixteenth century possessed the advantage of having their attention concentrated on a few subjects. French and Italian were commonly learned by the daughters of the nobility, and these comparatively easy studies were facilitated by the constant application to the classics. Music ranked with dancing and ornamental needlework as an accomplishment. It was a fashionable study for both sexes among the highest classes. Italy then was to England, in musical matters, what Germany has since become; but there were also English composers, among whom Henry VIII. himself was included. Vocal music was extremely popular, instrumental music being in a comparatively elementary stage. The English in the sixteenth century seem to have been a very music-loving people; Erasmus says, The most accomplished in the skill of music of any people; and the degree to which it was practised at court in the time of Henry VIII. may be guessed from the fact that singing at sight was then a common accomplishment among the courtiers. Counterpoint was studied by those who aspired to be connoisseurs; but musical literature was very scanty, and the repertorium available for the lute and the mandoline, the clavichord, or the virginals, must soon have been exhausted. There was less arithmetic, history, and geography taught than is now imparted in board schools to the poorest. The curriculum for a lady of rank did not include many things which have now become matters of common knowledge among the children of the working classes. On the other hand, the education, if narrow according to modern ideas, was thorough, and without the stimulus of college life, of competitive examinations, without the prospect of rewards and honours in the shape of degrees, the attainments of women in the sixteenth century in the subjects to which they had access, were of a high order, and their knowledge of the classics was more intimate and exact than that produced by the higher education of the nineteenth century. Learning was necessarily confined to women of position and wealth, who could afford the luxury of private tutors and the equally great luxury of books. There were, doubtless, here and there families of lower rank whose daughters would have borne favourable comparison with the titled ladies who are so conspicuous. But wide diffusion of knowledge and a high standard of education among women generally, if it existed, did not excite notice among contemporary writers as did the studious habits of the upper classes. Udall, the master of Eton in Queen Marys reign, speaks with admiration of-- the great number of noble women at that time in England, not only given to the study of human sciences and strange tongues, but also so thoroughly expert in Holy Scriptures that they were able to compare with the best writers, as well in enditeing and penning of godly and fruitful treatises to the instruction and edifying of realmes in the knowledge of God, as also in translating good books out of Latin or Greek into English for the use and commodity of such as are rude and ignorant of the said tongues. It was now no news in England to see young damsels in noble houses and in the courts of princes, instead of cards and other instruments of idle trifling, to have continually in their hands either psalms, homilies, and other devout meditations, or else Pauls Epistles or some book of Holy Scripture matters, and as familiarly both to read and reason thereof in Greek, Latin, French, or Italian as in English. It was now a common thing to see young virgins so trained in the study of good letters that they willingly set all other vain pastimes at naught for learning sake. It was now no news at all to see Queens and ladies of most high estate and progeny, instead of courtly dalliance, to embrace virtuous exercises of reading and writing, and with most earnest study both early and late to apply themselves to the acquiring of knowledge, as well in all other liberal artes and disciplines, as also most especially of God and his holy word. Erasmus, in one of his discourses, gives us a glimpse of the view taken by the Church of female scholarship. He introduces a conversation between an abbot and a learned woman. The abbot contends that women would never be kept in subjection if they were learned. They would become wiser than men. Therefore it is a wicked mischievous thing to revive the ancient custom of educating them. Taken in conjunction with a remark of Erasmus in one of his letters, it is doubtful whether after all he did not deem learning wasted on women. Describing Sir Thomas More, he says, He is wise with the wise, and jests with fools--with women especially, and his wife among them. A more liberal view was taken by Richard Mulcaster, the master of the school founded by the Merchant Taylors Company in 5/861, in the parish of St. Lawrence Poultney.""","""Women's education and intellectual achievements""","2013","""Women's education and intellectual achievements have undergone significant transformations throughout history, breaking barriers and making strides towards gender equality. From ancient times when women's education was limited to modern-day where women excel in various fields, the journey has been remarkable.  In ancient civilizations like Egypt, Greece, and Rome, women's education was restricted to household duties, nurturing children, and managing the household. However, exceptions like Hypatia of Alexandria stood out as influential scholars and philosophers. In medieval Europe, convents provided education to some women, allowing them to engage in scholarly pursuits within a religious context.  The Renaissance period witnessed some women breaking through societal norms to pursue education and intellectual endeavors. Figures like Christine de Pizan challenged conventional thinking through their writings. During the Age of Enlightenment, women like Emilie du Châtelet contributed significantly to scientific advancements despite facing gender-based discrimination.  The 19th century marked a turning point with the rise of the women's rights movement. Pioneers like Mary Wollstonecraft advocated for women's education as a means of empowerment. The establishment of women's colleges, such as Mount Holyoke in 1837, provided formal education opportunities for women, leading to a gradual shift in societal attitudes towards women's intellectual capabilities.  In the 20th century, women's education expanded rapidly, fueled by movements for gender equality. Notable figures like Marie Curie shattered glass ceilings in the male-dominated field of science, winning Nobel Prizes for her groundbreaking research. Women like Amelia Earhart and Margaret Mead excelled in fields traditionally reserved for men, inspiring generations of women to pursue their intellectual passions.  Today, women's education is more accessible than ever before. Women outnumber men in higher education enrollment in many countries, showcasing their intellectual prowess across diverse disciplines. Women have made significant contributions to literature, art, science, technology, politics, and more, proving their intellectual capabilities beyond any doubt.  In the realm of literature, authors like Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and J.K. Rowling have captured global audiences with their literary works, challenging societal norms and reshaping narratives. In the sciences, women like Rosalind Franklin, Jane Goodall, and Tu Youyou have made groundbreaking discoveries, furthering our understanding of the world.  Women's education and intellectual achievements continue to be celebrated and recognized worldwide. Initiatives promoting STEM education for girls, scholarships for women, and gender-inclusive curricula aim to bridge the remaining gaps in education and opportunities. As more women enter traditionally male-dominated fields, diversity and innovation thrive.

DATE OF THE OF IN.--.--.--.--MR. F. HOLTS.-- OF.--. -- OF OF IN THE OF AT THE OF THE AND OF THE. It has been a question much debated, whether the Art of Printing was not introduced to Europe from the East at a much earlier period than that generally assigned as the date of its invention; and we are informed by Klaproth, that it might have been known in Europe a hundred and fifty years prior to its discovery by the Germans, if Europeans had been able to read and translate the Persian historians, as the Chinese method of printing is clearly explained in the Djemma-et-tewarikh, by Rachid-Eddin, who finished this immense work about the year 310. On this subject, Mr. William Savage, a well-known printer, and a gentleman to whom the public and the profession are indebted for several valuable works on the art, states, in the preface to a volume published in 841,-- The dates given of the introduction of the practice into Europe by previous writers, are unquestionably erroneous, as we have conclusive evidence of its being followed as a profession for nearly a century before the earliest date they give: --and he announced his intention of embodying the facts and information he had been for a long period collecting, in another work, as hitherto, he declares, there has in reality been but little said on the History or Practice of Printing, the numerous works on the subject being chiefly copies from one or two of the earlier writers. This is true enough. From the very nature of the case it can scarcely be otherwise, until and unless the discovery of fresh facts, or the investigations of fresh inquirers lead to conclusions different to those which had previously been generally received. It is possible, nay probable, that a knowledge of the art, as practised in China, may have been carried to Europe by the Venetian travellers, or traders, at a very early date; but, as no account is known to exist that such really was the case, so no certain conclusion on the subject can be arrived at. Whether it was so or not, there is little difficulty in supposing that on many occasions attempts might be made similar to that contained in the much disputed account given by Papillon of the discovery at Bagneux, a village near Mont-Rouge, in the library of M. De Greder, a Swiss Captain, of a work, lent to M. De Greder by M. Sperchtvel, another Swiss Officer, supposed to have been printed in 284 or 285/8. This work, which has never since been seen, is said to have borne the following inscription in old Italian. The heroic actions, represented in figures, of the great and magnanimous Macedonian king, the bold and valiant Alexander; dedicated, presented, and humbly offered to the most holy Father, Pope Honorius IV, the glory and support of the Church, and to our illustrious and generous father and mother, by us Allessandro-Alberico Cunio, Cavaliere, and Isabella Cunio, twin brother and sister: first reduced, imagined, and attempted to be executed in relief with a small knife on blocks of wood made even and polished by this learned and dear sister, continued and finished by us together, at Ravenna, from the eight pictures of our invention, painted six times larger than here represented; engraved, explained by verses, and thus marked upon the paper to perpetuate the number of them, and to enable us to present them to our relations and friends, in testimony of gratitude, friendship, and affection. All this was done and finished by us when only 6 years of age. Interesting as this statement is, and correct as it possibly may be, it can scarcely be accepted as an historical fact, inasmuch as no one but the alleged discoverer appears ever to have seen the originals. ] Besides the preceding doubtful account we have notices of a print in the Library of Lyons with the date 384. Specimens of engravings of playing cards, as well as of saints, said to have been produced in the years 390 and 400 are also extant. From the year 400 to 440 other and more elaborate engravings, of a devotional character, are likewise to be met with. One of the most curious, representing St. Christopher carrying the infant Saviour across the sea, is in the possession of Earl Spencer, and bears the date 423. A few years later we find similar prints accompanied with explanatory inscriptions or texts of Scripture placed beneath them; next came whole series of these prints published together as a book; and lastly, the small Latin Grammars of Donatus, the common school-books of the day, engraved and printed in like manner. These productions are distinguished by Bibliographers as Block-books, and nine or ten different specimens are known to exist. Of these the most remarkable are the Biblia Pauperum, or Poor Mans Bible, a book containing 0 pages of quarto, or small folio prints, with several engravings with inscriptions upon each page, supposed to have been the years 420 and 435/8; and the Speculum Human Salvationis, or Mirror of Salvation, a book containing 3 leaves in the two Latin, and 2 in the two Dutch editions, (each in small folio), 8 of which are ornamented with engravings representing stories from the Old and New Testaments, beneath which are more copious explanatory inscriptions than those in the Biblia Pauperum. These editions are supposed to have been published between the years 430 and 45/87. Mean as these books would seem if issued from the press at the present day, they were wonderful productions for the age in which they appeared; and although the first named was called the Poor Mans Bible, or Book of the Poor, it was only in comparison with the cost of a written copy of the Holy Scriptures, which was worth the, in that day, enormous sum of 00. As very few copies are now in existence, (and those generally in an imperfect state), they have literally become worth more than their weight in gold: a copy of the Biblia Pauperum having been bought by the Duke of Marlborough, after a keen competition at an auction sale in 813, for the almost fabulous sum of 5/87. It was from these early Block-books, or Donatuses, that Gutenberg, as we learn from the statement of Ulric Zell,--a contemporary, and working printer at Mentz with the original inventors while the art was yet a secret,--derived his idea of printing as at present practised. In the words of Mr. Charles Knight, in his interesting biography of the venerable Caxton, the Father of the Art in England,-- To seize upon the idea, that the text or legend might be composed of separate letters, capable of re-arrangement after the impressions were taken off, so as to be applied without new cutting to other texts and legends, was to secure the principle upon which the printing art depended. It was easy to extend the principle from a few lines to a whole page, and from one page to many, so as to form a book. Such, according to the almost universally adopted belief, were the successive steps which led to the invention of. And for nearly a century no one had ventured to doubt that either images of saints, or characters for playing cards, were first printed from engraved wooden blocks, as cheap substitutes for the works of the draftsman and painter;--that these were succeeded by subjects of sacred history with explanatory legends cut in wood, imitative of the art of the illuminator, and the caligraphy of the scribes or professional writers;--that these again were followed by Donatuses;--and that from these Donatuses, printed from solid blocks, Gutenberg obtained his first idea of the Typographic Art. But in 868 an altogether new hypothesis was propounded at the annual congress of the British Archological Association, held that year at Cirencester. It was there maintained, in a paper read by Mr. Henry F. Holt, that printing from moveable types, as practised in Europe, preceded in point of time that of printing from engravings on wood.""","""History of Printing and Typography""","2189","""The history of printing and typography is a rich tapestry intertwined with the evolution of human communication and the dissemination of knowledge. From the early methods of hand-crafted manuscripts to the revolutionary invention of the printing press, each milestone in this journey has left an indelible mark on the way information is shared and preserved. Let's embark on a journey through time to explore the fascinating evolution of printing and typography.  The origins of printing can be traced back to ancient civilizations where various forms of communication were used. The earliest known form of printing dates back to ancient Mesopotamia around 3000 BCE, where cylinder seals were used to imprint designs on clay tablets. Moving forward, the Egyptians utilized hieroglyphics and papyrus scrolls to record their history and stories. The Chinese are credited with the invention of woodblock printing around the 9th century CE, a technique that involved carving entire pages of text or images onto wooden blocks and then transferring the ink onto paper.  However, it was in 1440 when Johannes Gutenberg, a German inventor, introduced his printing press with movable type that revolutionized the way information was disseminated. This invention marked the beginning of the Printing Revolution in Europe, as it enabled the mass production of books and other printed materials. Gutenberg's press used metal type pieces that could be rearranged and reused, making the process of printing faster, cheaper, and more efficient than ever before.  The impact of Gutenberg's printing press was profound, leading to an explosion of knowledge and literacy across Europe. Books, pamphlets, and newspapers became more accessible to the general public, fueling the spread of ideas, scientific discoveries, and religious reformations. The press played a crucial role in the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Reformation periods, shaping the course of human history and sparking cultural revolutions.  Typography, the art and technique of arranging type to make written language readable and appealing, also underwent significant developments alongside printing technology. Typefaces, or fonts, evolved from the earliest blackletter or Gothic styles to the elegant serif and sans-serif fonts we are familiar with today. Typeface designers such as Claude Garamond, William Caslon, and Giambattista Bodoni made enduring contributions to the field, creating timeless fonts that are still used in modern design.  The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century brought further advancements in printing technology, with the introduction of steam-powered presses, mechanized typesetting machines, and lithography. This period saw the rise of newspapers, magazines, and advertising, leading to a surge in printed materials and a growing demand for skilled typesetters and printers.  The 20th century witnessed a rapid evolution in printing and typography, driven by technological innovations such as offset printing, phototypesetting, and eventually digital printing. The advent of computers and desktop publishing software revolutionized the design and printing industries, allowing for greater flexibility and creativity in typography. Designers could now manipulate type with ease, experimenting with various fonts, sizes, colors, and layouts to achieve visually stunning effects.  The rise of the internet and digital media in the late 20th century further transformed the landscape of printing and typography. E-books, online publishing platforms, and digital fonts became ubiquitous, challenging the traditional printed book industry. Despite these changes, the art of typography remains a fundamental aspect of visual communication, influencing branding, advertising, graphic design, and user interfaces in the digital age.  Today, the field of printing and typography continues to evolve with advancements in 3D printing, augmented reality, and responsive web design. As we look towards the future, the importance of good typography in conveying information effectively and engaging audiences remains paramount. Whether in print or on screen, the art of typography plays a vital role in shaping our perceptions, emotions, and interactions with the written word.  In conclusion, the history of printing and typography is a testament to human ingenuity, creativity, and the enduring quest for knowledge. From the humble beginnings of ancient scribes and craftsmen to the high-tech digital studios of today, the journey of printing and typography has been a remarkable story of innovation and progress. As we continue to push the boundaries of technology and design, let us remember the profound impact that printing and typography have had on society, culture, and the way we communicate with one another.""","857"
"Wing Kittridge A ","""The continuity of Pueblo life traces from origins in northwest New Mexico and the Mesa Verde country of southwest Colorado, through the Bandelier region, to the living towns of Cochiti to the south, San Ildefonso to the northeast, and other local Indian communities. The Ruins: Their Types and Extent The evidences of ancient human occupation in the Bandelier neighborhood are apparent even to the most casual observer. When driving over the approach road to the monument headquarters one cannot fail to observe cave rooms in the cliffs on every hand; the continuing spectacle of smoke-blackened chambers dug into the rock provides the stimulus of discovery en route. But the roadside introduction is an infinitesimal preview of the total scope of prehistoric man's activity in the region. In actuality, all of the ruins contained within the national monument represent but a small fraction of the ruins of the surrounding plateau. The entire eastern slope of the Jemez Mountains to the west, throughout the zone of moderate elevations from,00 feet down to the Rio Grande at,00 feet, appears to have been thickly settled in prehistoric times; this eastern slope has been given the name of Pajarito Plateau. The extent of the plateau is, very roughly, 0 miles north to south, and 0 miles east to least one of these great buildings contained over 00 rooms; there are several which had over 00 rooms, to a height of stories. These multistory towns were built of the local tuff, shattered and pecked into convenient size for masonry use, and laid with mud mortar. The great houses were situated both on mesa-tops and in canyon bottoms; some were designed as hollow squares or circles, others had only a haphazard ground plan. None of these dwellings today is more than one story high, so that their original height is unknown in detail, but great massivity and considerable defensive strength are apparent even from the remaining mounds of rubble. The rooms of the community houses were scarcely larger than the cave rooms already described; almost none of the surviving ground-floor rooms are more than 0 by 2 feet, and the typical room measures perhaps by 0 feet. These chambers were quite dark and unventilated, since there were almost no windows or even connecting doorways between rooms; almost every room of the ground floor was entered by a ladder through an opening in its ceiling. It is conjectured that these first-floor cells were designed in this fashion to serve as storage places for foodstuffs, more secure from rodents by reason of having only one opening in the roof. Moreover, the lower-floor walls were a stronger foundation for the upper floors when built without door or window openings. Finally, this design provided maximum security for defense against human marauders. It has been mentioned that a composite type of building, combining cave rooms and masonry walls, is common in the area. This sort of construction was responsible for the many rows of small holes still to be seen in the cliffs, evenly spaced some feet apart above the cave doorways. These holes were cut and used as sockets to support the ends of roof beams extending forward from the cliff and providing ceilings for the masonry rooms which once stood there. These evenly spaced holes, which you first see along many of the canyon walls, give mute evidence of the early aboriginal occupation of this area. Many of these talus dwellings reached a height of stories and pushed out from the cliff and rooms deep, so that the cave rooms which were occupied first became relegated to storage space in the dark rear interiors. To conclude this general summation of ruin types, some description should be made of kivas. Kivas were, and are, the ceremonial chambers of the Pueblo people; as such, they are universally present in the Pajarito communities and their design makes them identifiable even in the ruined state. The local kivas were always round and were dug almost full-depth into the ground, except for certain examples which were excavated into the relatively soft bedrock of cliff or mesa-top. The circular depressions still to be found in the plazas of the great communal houses are the remains of kivas with their roofs collapsed and with the wind-borne debris of centuries accumulated in the hollows. A more complete discussion of kivas and their functions will be found on page 2. Principal Ruins of the National Monument Bandelier National Monument is divided into two parcels of land: the Otowi section of about square miles and the Frijoles section of nearly 3 square miles. Within these two areas are contained great concentrations of ruins, including several of the largest on the plateau. A number of the Bandelier ruins have been excavated, so there is quite a detailed knowledge of the culture which once flourished on the monument lands. The most frequently visited part of the monument is the canyon of the Rito de los Frijoles, wherein is located the monument headquarters. In this well-watered and wooded canyon are to be found ruins of the three types described above, which had well over,00 rooms in their prime some 00 years ago. Here also is the excavated remnant of the largest kiva found anywhere in the Pajarito country--a chamber which perhaps was the community center of religious practice for the entire canyon.. On the floor of Frijoles Canyon, a little upstream from the headquarters museum, is Tyuonyi, the chief building of the area, and one of the most impressive pueblo ruins in the Rio Grande drainage. Situated on a level bench of open ground, perhaps 00 feet from the Rito and 5/8 feet above the water, Tyuonyi at one time contained over 00 rooms, to a height of stories in part. Its modern aspect is greatly reduced in height; although excavated, no walls have been restored, so that only the ground floor is still evident, with outer and inner walls standing to a height of or feet throughout.""","""Pueblo ruins and archaeological significance""","1208","""Pueblo ruins stand as poignant testaments to the ancient Native American civilizations that once thrived across the American Southwest. These archaeological sites offer us a window into the rich cultural heritage and complex societies of the Ancestral Puebloan people, also known as the Anasazi. The ruins, often found in present-day Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, hold immense archaeological significance, shedding light on the ways of life, architectural prowess, and spiritual beliefs of these ancient peoples.  One of the most iconic Pueblo ruins is Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. This UNESCO World Heritage Site features monumental masonry buildings such as Pueblo Bonito, which housed hundreds of rooms and ceremonial spaces. The precision in construction, astronomical alignments, and advanced urban planning at Chaco Canyon indicate a sophisticated society with strong cultural and religious practices. Similarly, Mesa Verde in Colorado boasts cliff dwellings built into the natural sandstone alcoves, showcasing the architectural ingenuity and adaptability of the Ancestral Puebloans to their environment.  The layout of Pueblo ruins often reflects a communal lifestyle, characterized by multi-story buildings that housed extended families and entire communities. The design of structures like kivas, underground chambers used for rituals and gatherings, highlights the spiritual connection that the Ancestral Puebloans held with the natural world and celestial bodies. The intricate pottery, petroglyphs, and artifacts found within these ruins provide insights into their artistic expressions, agricultural practices, trade networks, and social organization.  Beyond their architectural and artistic significance, Pueblo ruins serve as valuable archaeological sites for researchers and historians. Through careful excavation and analysis of artifacts, pottery, tools, and plant remains, scholars can piece together the everyday lives, economic activities, and belief systems of the Ancestral Puebloans. Studying the layout of settlements, patterns of migration, and changes in material culture over time helps archaeologists reconstruct the timeline of human occupation and environmental adaptations in the region.  Moreover, Pueblo ruins offer a platform for understanding the eventual decline and abandonment of these once-thriving communities. Factors such as climatic changes, resource depletion, social upheaval, or conflict with neighboring groups likely contributed to the gradual desertion of these settlements. By examining the layers of history preserved within the ruins, researchers can unravel the complexities of societal collapse and the resilience of ancient populations in the face of adversity.  Preserving Pueblo ruins is paramount not only for their historical value but also for their cultural significance to modern Indigenous communities. These sites hold sacred meaning for Native American tribes who trace their ancestry to the Ancestral Puebloans. Protecting and respecting these ancestral homelands is crucial for maintaining cultural identity, fostering intergenerational knowledge transmission, and honoring the traditions of the past.  In conclusion, Pueblo ruins stand as poignant reminders of the ingenuity, spirituality, and resilience of the Ancestral Puebloan people. These archaeological sites offer a glimpse into a bygone era, illuminating the complexities of ancient societies and the enduring legacy of Native American cultures. By studying and preserving Pueblo ruins, we not only celebrate the achievements of our predecessors but also nurture a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of human history and the natural world.""","646"
"Posselt E A  Emanuel Anthony ","""In this case the second section requires only half as many hooks as the first; and for the same reason, if we are forming figures with two ground-threads and one whip-thread, the first section will contain three times as many hooks as the second, etc. Very often two whip-threads are used for twisting, in which case they must be drawn together in the doup. If several whip and ground-threads are drawn into one reed they usually work independently at first on a regular weave; following this is the gauze weave formed by a certain number of whip-threads raised either on the left or right of the ground-threads contained in the same dent. This movement brings into operation the second section of the machine containing the harness-cords for the standard heddles. The technical terms for these various combinations are: single-thread gauze, double-thread gauze, triple-thread gauze, etc. The tie-up most generally used requires two-thirds of the needles for ground heddles and one-third of the needles for standard heddles; hence, if using a 00 machine we find: 28 needles and hooks for the ground heddles, and 4 needles and hooks for the standard heddles. The comber-board is divided into two sections. The rear used for the ground, the front used for the standard. Threading of the Harness. Thread the warp into the ground heddles in the same manner as a common straight-through tie-up. Then take the first left-hand thread of the warp and draw it through the doup. The next two warp-threads draw above the first one on the left-hand side of the same doup. These three warp-threads must be drawn together in one dent. After drawing the first pair in one dent, leave one, two, or more dents empty, according to the fabric. The th, th and th warp-threads, also each subsequent pair, are threaded the same as the first. Figs.. and. are designed for illustrating this point. The lingoes for the doups are about one-half the weight of those used for the ground heddles. Fig. XC. represents a fancy gauze to be executed in this manner. Fig. XCI. represents the threading of the harness for a gauze fabric: f, g, first and second warp-thread, over the doup; h, i, third and fourth, through the doup. Figs. XCII. and. illustrate the two movements of the harness in the gauze weave. Figs. XCIV. and XCV. illustrate the movements of the harness in the regular weave: a, b, represents the comber-board; c, the place where the doup is fastened to the dead harness; d, e, the standard heddle; f, g, h, i, the mails of the common heddles. The following are the fourteen different movements that might be required in regular weaving. The figures show the number of threads up and the number down, thus: equal first warp-thread up; second, third, and fourth down.. = f up.. = g up.. = h up, doup raised.. = i up, doup raised.. = f and g up.. = g and h up, doup raised.. = h and i up, doup raised.. = f and h up, doup raised.. = f and i up, doup raised. 0. = g and i up, doup raised. 1. = f, g, and h up, doup raised. 2. = g, h, and i up, doup raised. 3. = f, g, and i up, doup raised. 4. = f, h, and i up, doup raised. These fourteen different movements cover all the possible changes in regular weaving. The in Fig., in addition to forming the regular weave, is also necessary to the formation of the gauze weave. These few explanations clearly show the great variety of effects possible for the designer; for he can figure with the regular method of weaving, and can also figure gauze weaving to exchange with regular weaving, forming a separate design on the fabric. Modifications of the Single Lift Jacquard Machine. Having thoroughly described the construction and action of the regular Jacquard machine, it now remains to illustrate and explain its modifications. Among the most prominent are: st. The Double Lift Single Cylinder Jacquard Machine. d. The Double Lift Double Cylinder Jacquard Machine. d. The Arrangement of Substituting Tail-cords in place of the Hooks, etc. I. Double Lift Single Cylinder Jacquard Machine. The principle of this machine consists in raising the warp-threads any number of times in succession without allowing the shed to close, thus performing the work in nearly half the time, and with less wear and tear on the warp. Fig. XCVI. represents the sectional cut of one row across all the griffe-bars. The machine selected for the illustration is of the 2-row type. Jacquard machines of this description have two hooks to one needle; therefore in the drawing twenty-four hooks are represented. Two griffes are provided, each working every alternate hook. In Fig. XCVI. the sectional cut of both griffes is shown, and in Fig.. the top view of both griffes; the first set is represented shaded, the second black. The former requires hooks Nos.,,,,, 1, 3, 5/8, 7, 9, 1, 3, and the latter Nos.,,,, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4. This arrangement permits either hook to be lifted separately by the griffes, and a corresponding elevation of the leash. As these griffes work in opposition, one descends while the other ascends; this motion prevents the leash from dropping the entire length of the cords, since the ascending griffe catches it at half distance as the two griffes pass each other. In this operation the shed is never entirely closed, and a corresponding gain in speed is attained. It will thus be seen that the double lift single cylinder has great advantages over the ordinary machine. Of course, the warp-thread must make its complete journeys up and down when called for by the design; but when once up, it need not be brought down until absolutely required by the pattern. The warp is thus subjected to less friction in working, and it is possible to use yarns with less twist and obtain good results. The advantages arising from not closing the shed may be seen in the following example of a warp-thread working on an -leaf satin, in which seven picks are up in succession. By the single lift machine this warp-thread must travel seven times up and seven times down, thus closing the shed absolutely seven times, with a corresponding wear and tear. The double lift single cylinder arrangement does not require the warp-thread to make these seven complete journeys to the race-board of the lay, but instead it makes seven half trips. The saving may be shown by the following analysis: Single lift machine, warp-thread, seven picks up in succession, in -leaf fourteen complete movements. Double lift single cylinder machine requiring for the same effect: Up the first time, = one complete movement. Six times down, } half movements, = six complete movements. Six times up, } Down the last time, = one complete movement. Or eight complete movements. Showing the utility of the two machines to be to each other as to 4, or to. Fig.. illustrates the complete double lift single cylinder Jacquard machine, as built by W. P. Uhlinger, Philadelphia. In this drawing both griffes are distinctly visible; also their mode of operation by means of the double-acting lever. This machine has the set of hooks for each griffe-bar protected by a plate of sheet iron, thus steadying the hooks in their motion, and enabling smaller crooks to be used for the latter. Fig. IC. represents a double lift single cylinder Jacquard machine as built by Thomas Halton, Philadelphia, attached to a regular broad loom, (Knowles or Crompton), and tied-up for upholstery work. The griffe-bars in this Jacquard machine are constructed of such height that when lifted they never rise above the crooks of the hooks, which are thrown out of operation by the descent of the other griffe. Fig. C., hooks at rest. Fig. CI., hooks and, etc., raised, = and, etc., at rest. Fig. CII., hooks and, etc., raised, = and, etc., at rest. II. Double Lift Double Cylinder Jacquard Machine. The principle of this machine consists in the combination of two separate Jacquard machines. Two connected to one leash of the Jacquard harness, and as each machine is operated alternately, a high speed is attained, which is the purpose of the machine. For example: 40 picks per requires 0 picks per minute from each part of the double lift double cylinder. In Fig. CIII. this is clearly illustrated. It shows two 2-row, thus giving 4 griffe-bars for the complete double machine, as the griffes work within each other. As explained for double lift single cylinder, every alternate bar is connected with a separate griffe, and these two griffes are worked alternately on the same double lever arrangement.

Developed by Joseph Marie Jacquard in the early 19th century, these machines utilized punched cards to control the weaving of patterns, mechanizing what was once a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Understanding the mechanics behind Jacquard weaving machines is essential to appreciate their importance and the craftsmanship involved in their operation.  At the heart of a Jacquard loom is the Jacquard mechanism, a complex system of pulleys, cylinders, hooks, and needles. The mechanism is responsible for lifting and lowering individual warp threads to create the desired shed for the weft yarn to pass through. Unlike traditional looms where weavers manually controlled each warp thread, the Jacquard mechanism automates this process based on the pattern encoded in the punched cards.  The key innovation of the Jacquard system lies in the use of punched cards to store the weaving pattern. Each card corresponds to a row of the woven design, with holes punched in the card indicating which warp threads should be raised or lowered for a particular pick of weft. These cards are laced together to form a continuous chain known as a """"chain of cards"""" or """"program."""" As the loom operates, the cards are fed through the Jacquard machine, which reads the pattern and controls the lifting of the warp threads accordingly.  The punched cards are read by a series of connected rods and hooks in the Jacquard machine. As the cards move through the machine, the presence or absence of a hole in a specific position determines whether a hook connected to a particular warp thread will be raised or remain in a lowered position. This intricate interplay of rods and hooks allows for precise control over the positioning of individual warp threads, enabling the creation of intricate patterns and designs.  The warp yarn is attached to a series of individual lifting hooks, each corresponding to a warp thread. When a hook is raised by the Jacquard mechanism, the attached warp thread is lifted, creating the shed for the weft yarn to pass through. By selectively raising different combinations of warp threads in each row according to the pattern on the punched cards, the loom can weave intricate designs with remarkable detail and precision.  In addition to the Jacquard mechanism, Jacquard weaving machines feature a range of components that work together to ensure smooth and efficient operation. These include warp beams to hold the warp yarn under tension, a weft insertion system to insert the weft yarn across the warp threads, and a beating mechanism to pack the weft yarn into place after each insertion. The coordination of these components is essential for producing high-quality woven fabrics with intricate designs.  The evolution of Jacquard weaving machines has continued over the years, with modern machines incorporating advanced technologies such as computerized controls and electronic dobby systems. These enhancements have further improved the speed, efficiency, and precision of Jacquard weaving, allowing for the production of complex patterns with greater ease and versatility.  In conclusion, the mechanics of Jacquard weaving machines reflect a harmonious blend of intricate engineering and artistic expression. From the intricate interplay of pulleys and hooks to the precise control of individual warp threads based on coded patterns, these machines exemplify the marriage of technology and craftsmanship in the textile industry. By understanding and appreciating the mechanics behind Jacquard weaving machines, we gain a deeper insight into the complexity and beauty of woven textiles created through this remarkable technology.""","691"
"Bell Thomas J  Thomas Jefferson  1852 ","""Upon the limestone lays the drift, consisting of water-worn pebbles, gravel, sand, and clay. The porous nature of this formation, with the assistance of a level surface plain, absorbs a very large percentage of the rain-fall, and produces a fertile subterranean water supply, whose depth varies from 0 to 00 feet. There are in this vicinity about 5/80 wells that secure the water from this source. The water is strongly impregnated with iron and magnesia--a ferruginous decomposition from the fossil drift-wood found in this formation. The availability of these wells is in proportion to the capacity of the respective pumps attached to them, but their combined requirements have had no apparent effect, at present, on the source. Yet the fact can not be disputed, that this drift supply of water is a very limited one. The practical experience in London and Liverpool substantiate the above fact, for there the underground sources have been materially lessened by the demands made upon them, notwithstanding they are the richest resources of this nature, and vastly superior to ours. Prof. Orton, of the Ohio Agricultural College, in a valuable paper on the Relations of Geology to the Water Supply of the Country, refers to the purity of the drift water in the south-western part of the State. He says: The broad and fertile terraces of the river valleys constitute, especially in the south-western corner of the State (Ohio), the most attractive and most valuable portion of its area. They consist of sand and gravel in large measures, and to this structure they owe their chief attraction. But this same structure renders them unfit to be used for the water supply of the towns built upon them; for, although an abundance of clear and sparkling water can easily be reached, it must not only be looked upon with suspicion, but must be positively condemned as unsafe. These gravel-beds are as porous as a sieve, and there is indisputable proof of the free communication of the water sheet and all the receptacles of impurity that the surface of the ground contains. The only relief is found in the fact that the water sheet is also in free communication with the rivers, rising and falling with them; but even this does not free the wells from the poisonous effects of the filth soakage from above. Geology turns over to sanitary science the conclusion, that the drift wells of central and south-western Ohio are, in all densely populated districts, small cities, towns, villages, and hamlets--even in those containing no more than a dozen houses--utterly unfit for human use. The above facts are applicable to all the drift formation, including that portion protected from immediate filth soakage of blue clay formation. A recent examination of our sewerage system, by the U. S. Census Bureau, developed the fact that Cincinnati is polluting its subterraneous soil, to an alarming degree, by the vault system. That no city has so neglected the sanitary necessity of tapping the sewers for house drainage than Cincinnati; that this nature of carelessness was the cause of Memphis sad fate, which we have escaped because our soil is of sand and gravel, and susceptible of natural drainage. Yet through this same soil passes the water that is used by some 5/80 well-owners, still the use of this water is increasing. London was originally supplied by shallow wells in gravel-beds of 0 to 0 feet in depth, and the direction of its growth was controlled by this water-bearing strata, until the establishment of the New River Water Company in 600. The Public Health Act of 872 gives the sanitary authorities power to close these wells. Total,5/80 feet. The synopsis of boring is condensed as follows: July 4, 880.--The contractor, John J. Pfeffer, drove a -inch iron tube with a heavy sinker, a few feet at a time, through 23 feet of drift, into limestone. A sand-pump was used to remove the loose formation. This portion was completed August d, 1 A. M. August.--Commenced drilling a 1/2-inch hole through the stone formation at an average rate of 3 feet per 4 hours, and continued to a depth of 25/8 feet, when the diameter of the hole was reduced to 38 inches. The drilling was then continued, at the rate of 9 feet per 4 hours, until the 8th of August, when the socket pulled out of pole attached to sinker at bottom of well, and at the same moment the top pole, attached to chain on drilling beam, broke and fell into the well along-side of the sinker. This accident was repaired September th, and drilling resumed, at rate of 0 feet per 4 hours, until a depth of,25/8 feet was reached, October 1, 880, when the drill broke. Resumed work, at rate of 2 feet per 4 hours, until November, 880, when a depth of,65/8 feet was reached. At the depth of,25/8 feet, the well was tested by sinking a -inch pipe into the well with a bag at lower end to fit tightly into the 1/2-inch bore. When the pipe reached a depth of 5/8 feet below the -inch tubing, the water flowed over the top of the pipe at surface, showing a leak around the bottom of the pipe where it was bedded in the rock. November th.--Tested well, and found a pressure of 0 lbs. per square inch, and a flow of 0 gallons of water per minute. February 7, 881.--When testing well No., the gauge was placed on this one, which showed only 5/8 lbs. The bore was then increased to 1/2 inches, and drilling continued to a depth of,60 feet, the last 0 feet being only 1/2 inches in diameter. The additional 25/8 feet was through alternate formations of sand and limestone; the last 0 feet through a hard flinty formation. Boring into this last formation increased the pressure to 1 lbs., and the flow to 00,00 gallons per day. The outlay of the two wells is placed at $,00. The analysis of the Moerlein artesian well, by Prof. Wayne, gave the following results: OF AND.""","""Water supply and geology implications""","1319","""Water Supply and Geology Implications  Water supply is a fundamental resource essential for sustaining life, supporting ecosystems, and driving economic activities. The availability and quality of water are intricately linked to geological factors that govern the movement, storage, and filtration of water within the Earth's crust. Geology plays a crucial role in shaping the quantity and quality of water resources, influencing everything from groundwater recharge to surface water flow patterns. Understanding the geology of a region is key to effectively managing water resources and ensuring sustainable access to clean water for various uses.  Geological structures such as aquifers, rock formations, fault lines, and soil composition are critical in determining the potential for water storage and movement within an area. Aquifers, which are underground layers of rock or sediment that hold water, play a significant role in groundwater supply. The porosity and permeability of aquifers, controlled by the geology of the region, determine how easily water can flow through them. Understanding the geology of aquifers is essential for successful groundwater management, as it influences the extraction rates, recharge possibilities, and vulnerability to contamination.  The presence of impermeable rock layers or geological faults can impact the movement of water, leading to the formation of groundwater basins or barriers that affect water flow patterns. Faults, fractures, and folds in the Earth's crust can create conduits for groundwater movement or act as barriers that impede water flow. Knowledge of these geological features is crucial for predicting groundwater flow paths, delineating recharge zones, and avoiding contamination risks from activities like fracking or improper waste disposal.  Geological processes also influence water quality by influencing the composition of minerals and chemicals that water comes into contact with as it moves through rock layers. The interaction between water and geological formations can lead to the enrichment or depletion of ions and elements in water, affecting its suitability for consumption or various uses. For example, water passing through limestone formations may become rich in calcium and magnesium ions, leading to hard water that can cause scaling in plumbing systems.  Furthermore, geology impacts surface water resources through the shaping of watersheds, river channels, and drainage patterns. The topography and geology of a region determine how water flows over the land surface, with factors such as slope, soil type, and rock formations influencing erosion rates, sediment transport, and water storage in reservoirs or natural water bodies. Understanding the geological controls on surface water systems is crucial for managing floods, preserving wetlands, and maintaining ecosystem health.  Geological hazards such as landslides, sinkholes, or subsidence can also pose risks to water infrastructure and impact water quality and availability. Unstable geological conditions can compromise the integrity of water supply systems, leading to disruptions in water delivery or contamination events. By considering the geological context of a region, water managers can assess and mitigate risks associated with natural hazards that could affect water resources.  In conclusion, the relationship between water supply and geology is intricate and multifaceted, with geological factors exerting a significant influence on the quantity, quality, and distribution of water resources. By understanding the geology of a region, water managers can make informed decisions regarding water resource management, conservation efforts, infrastructure development, and hazard mitigation strategies. A holistic approach that integrates geological knowledge with hydrological expertise is essential for ensuring sustainable water supply systems that meet the needs of both present and future generations.""","673"
"Tylor Edward B  Edward Burnett ","""In the medival Chronicle of John of Bromton there is mentioned a wonder which happens about once a month in the Gulf of Satalia, on the Pamphylian coast. A great black dragon seems to come in the clouds, letting down his head into the waves, while his tail seems fixed to the sky, and this dragon draws up the waves to him with such avidity that even a laden ship would be taken up on high, so that to avoid this danger the crews ought to shout and beat boards to drive the dragon off. However, concludes the chronicler, some indeed say that this is not a dragon, but the sun drawing up the water, which seems more true. The Moslems still account for waterspouts as caused by gigantic demons, such as that one described in the Arabian Nights: The sea became troubled before them, and there arose from it a black pillar, ascending towards the sky, and approaching the meadow. and behold it was a Jinnee, of gigantic stature. The difficulty in interpreting language like this is to know how far it is seriously and how far fancifully meant. But this doubt in no way goes against its original animistic meaning, of which there can be no question in the following story of a great sea-serpent current among a barbarous East African tribe. A chief of the Wanika told Dr. Krapf of a great serpent which is sometimes seen out at sea, reaching from the sea to the sky, and appearing especially during heavy rain. I told them, says the missionary, that this was no serpent, but a waterspout. Out of the similar phenomenon on land there has arisen a similar group of myths. The Moslem fancies the whirling sand-pillar of the desert to be caused by the flight of an evil jinn, and the East African simply calls it a demon (phepo). To traveller after traveller who gazes on these monstrous shapes gliding majestically across the desert, the thought occurs that the well-remembered Arabian Nights descriptions rest upon personifications of the sand-pillars themselves, as the gigantic demons into which fancy can even now so naturally shape them. Rude and distant tribes agree in the conception of the Rainbow as a living monster. New Zealand myth, describing the battle of the Tempest against the Forest, tells how the Rainbow arose and placed his mouth close to Tane-mahuta, the Father of Trees, and continued to assault him till his trunk was snapt in two, and his broken branches strewed the ground. It is not only in mere nature-myth like this, but in actual awe-struck belief and terror, that the idea of the live Rainbow is worked out. The Karens of Burma say it is a spirit or demon. The Rainbow can devour men. When it devours a person, he dies a sudden or violent death. All persons that die badly, by falls, by drowning, or by wild beasts, die because the Rainbow has devoured their ka-la, or spirit. On devouring persons it becomes thirsty and comes down to drink, when it is seen in the sky drinking water. Therefore when people see the Rainbow, they say, The Rainbow has come to drink water. Look out, some one or other will die violently by an evil death. If children are playing, their parents will say to them, The Rainbow has come down to drink. Play no more, lest some accident should happen to you. And after the Rainbow has been seen, if any fatal accident happens to anyone, it is said the Rainbow has devoured him. The Zulu ideas correspond in a curious way with these. The Rainbow lives with a snake, that is, where it is there is also a snake; or it is like a sheep, and dwells in a pool. When it touches the earth, it is drinking at a pool. Men are afraid to wash in a large pool; they say there is a Rainbow in it, and if a man goes in, it catches and eats him. The Rainbow, coming out of a river or pool and resting on the ground, poisons men whom it meets, affecting them with eruptions. Men say, The Rainbow is disease. If it rests on a man, something will happen to him. Lastly in Dahome, Danh the Heavenly Snake, which makes the Popo beads and confers wealth on man, is the Rainbow. To the theory of Animism belong those endless tales which all nations tell of the presiding genii of nature, the spirits of cliffs, wells, waterfalls, volcanoes, the elves and wood nymphs seen at times by human eyes when wandering by moonlight or assembled at their fairy festivals. Such beings may personify the natural objects they belong to, as when, in a North American tale, the guardian spirit of waterfalls rushes through the lodge as a raging current, bearing rocks and trees along in its tremendous course, and then the guardian spirit of the islands of Lake Superior enters in the guise of rolling waves covered with silver-sparkling foam. Or they may be guiding and power-giving spirits of nature, like the spirit Fugamu, whose work is the cataract of the Nguyai, and who still wanders night and day around it, though the negroes who tell of him can no longer see his bodily form. The belief prevailing through the lower culture that the diseases which vex mankind are brought by individual personal spirits, is one which has produced striking examples of mythic development. Thus in Burma the Karen lives in terror of the mad la, the epileptic la, and the rest of the seven evil demons who go about seeking his life; and it is with a fancy not many degrees removed from this early stage of thought that the Persian sees in bodily shape the apparition of Al, the scarlet fever: Would you know Al? she seems a blushing maid, With locks of flame and cheeks all rosy red. It is with this deep old spiritualistic belief clearly in view that the ghastly tales are to be read where pestilence and death come on their errand in weird human shape. To the mind of the Israelite, death and pestilence took the personal form of the destroying angel who smote the doomed. When the great plague raged in Justinians time, men saw on the sea brazen barks whose crews were black and headless men, and where they landed, the pestilence broke out. When the plague fell on Rome in Gregorys time, the saint rising from prayer saw Michael standing with his bloody sword on Hadrians castle the archangel stands there yet in bronze, giving the old fort its newer name of the Castle of St. Angelo. Among a whole group of stories of the pestilence seen in personal shape travelling to and fro in the land, perhaps there is none more vivid than this Slavonic one. There sat a Russian under a larch-tree, and the sunshine glared like fire. He saw something coming from afar; he looked again it was the Pest-maiden, huge of stature, all shrouded in linen, striding towards him. He would have fled in terror, but the form grasped him with her long outstretched hand. Knowest thou the Pest? she said; I am she. Take me on thy shoulders and carry me through all Russia; miss no village, no town, for I must visit all. But fear not for thyself, thou shalt be safe amid the dying. Clinging with her long hands, she clambered on the peasants back; he stepped onward, saw the form above him as he went, but felt no burden. First he bore her to the towns; they found there joyous dance and song; but the form waved her linen shroud, and joy and mirth were gone. As the wretched man looked round, he saw mourning, he heard the tolling of the bells, there came funeral processions, the graves could not hold the dead. He passed on, and coming near each village heard the shriek of the dying, saw all faces white in the desolate houses. But high on the hill stands his own hamlet: his wife, his little children are there, and the aged parents, and his heart bleeds as he draws near. With strong gripe he holds the maiden fast, and plunges with her beneath the waves. He sank: she rose again, but she quailed before a heart so fearless, and fled far away to the forest and the mountain. Yet, if mythology be surveyed in a more comprehensive view, it is seen that its animistic development falls within a broader generalization still. The explanation of the course and change of nature, as caused by life such as the life of the thinking man who gazes on it, is but a part of a far wider mental process. It belongs to that great doctrine of analogy, from which we have gained so much of our apprehension of the world around us. Distrusted as it now is by severer science for its misleading results, analogy is still to us a chief means of discovery and illustration, while in earlier grades of education its influence was all but paramount. Analogies which are but fancy to us were to men of past ages reality. They could see the flame licking its yet undevoured prey with tongues of fire, or the serpent gliding along the waving sword from hilt to point; they could feel a live creature gnawing within their bodies in the pangs of hunger; they heard the voices of the hill-dwarfs answering in the echo, and the chariot of the Heaven-god rattling in thunder over the solid firmament. Men to whom these were living thoughts had no need of the schoolmaster and his rules of composition, his injunctions to use metaphor cautiously, and to take continual care to make all similes consistent. The similes of the old bards and orators were consistent, because they seemed to see and hear and feel them: what we call poetry was to them real life, not as to the modern versemaker a masquerade of gods and heroes, shepherds and shepherdesses, stage heroines and philosophic savages in paint and feathers. It was with a far deeper consciousness that the circumstance of nature was worked out in endless imaginative detail in ancient days and among uncultured races. Upon the sky above the hill-country of Orissa, Pidzu Pennu, the Rain-god of the Khonds, rests as he pours down the showers through his sieve.""","""Mythology and animism in nature.""","2155","""Mythology and animism have long been woven into the intricate tapestry of human civilization, shaping beliefs, rituals, and cultural identities across diverse societies. The reverence for nature as a living, breathing entity imbued with spirits and significance is a fundamental aspect of animistic traditions found in various mythologies worldwide. From ancient civilizations to indigenous tribes, the concept of animism in nature has fostered a profound sense of interconnectedness between humans and the natural world, fostering a deep respect for the environment and its inhabitants. This holistic worldview has not only inspired awe and wonder but also guided ethical behavior and spiritual practices, highlighting the enduring relevance of mythology and animism in shaping our understanding of the world around us.  In animistic belief systems, nature is perceived as a sacred realm inhabited by myriad spirits, deities, and supernatural beings. These entities are believed to possess unique personalities, powers, and wisdom, influencing the forces of nature and governing various aspects of human life. From the thunder god of ancient Norse mythology to the fertility goddesses of indigenous cultures, the natural world is personified and revered through a rich tapestry of myths and legends, embodying the essence of animism in its purest form. Through storytelling, rituals, and ceremonies, these myths serve as a bridge between the material and spiritual realms, offering insights into the mysteries of creation, existence, and the interconnectedness of all beings.  One of the central tenets of animism is the belief in the inherent agency and vitality of all living things, from towering trees and majestic mountains to humble insects and flowing rivers. This perspective underscores the interconnectedness of life forms and the interdependence of ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of balance, reciprocity, and harmony in the natural world. By recognizing the consciousness and sentience present in nature, animistic traditions promote a sense of empathy, humility, and stewardship towards the environment, inspiring practices that honor and safeguard the delicate equilibrium of ecosystems.  Throughout history, mythology has served as a powerful tool for elucidating complex cosmological concepts, moral principles, and existential inquiries through symbolic narratives and allegorical representations. In animistic traditions, myths often depict the cyclical rhythms of nature, the interplay of light and darkness, and the eternal dance of life and death. Drawing upon the language of symbolism and metaphor, these myths convey profound truths about the mysteries of existence, the passage of time, and the interconnected web of life that sustains the universe.  In many animistic belief systems, nature is not merely a backdrop or resource for human existence but a living, sentient presence worthy of reverence, gratitude, and respect. This attitude is reflected in various cultural practices such as nature-based ceremonies, offerings to spirits, and rituals that acknowledge the seasons, elements, and cosmic forces at play in the world. By engaging with nature in a spirit of reciprocity and mindfulness, individuals align themselves with the rhythms of the natural world, fostering a sense of belonging, interconnectedness, and spiritual fulfillment.  The connection between mythology and animism in nature extends beyond individual belief systems to encompass broader cultural narratives, artistic expressions, and communal practices that shape a collective understanding of the world. From the epic tales of Greek gods and goddesses to the intricate creation myths of indigenous tribes, mythology serves as a repository of cultural wisdom, ancestral knowledge, and collective memory that informs identity, values, and social cohesion. Through shared stories, symbols, and rituals, communities forge bonds with the land, ancestors, and supernatural realms, weaving a vibrant tapestry of meaning and significance that resonates across generations.  The enduring appeal of mythology and animism lies in their capacity to transcend temporal and spatial boundaries, resonating with universal themes, archetypes, and experiences that speak to the core of human consciousness. Whether exploring the divine mysteries of the cosmos, the transformative power of mythic heroes, or the moral dilemmas of mortal beings, mythology offers a lens through which to interpret the complexities of existence and the enigmatic forces that shape our lives. In the realm of animism, these myths find expression in the sacred landscapes, spiritual practices, and cultural traditions that celebrate the intrinsic worth and interconnectedness of all life forms.  As we navigate an increasingly complex and interconnected world, the wisdom of mythology and animism in nature offers invaluable insights into our place in the web of life, the sanctity of the natural world, and the enduring relevance of ancient wisdom in a modern context. By embracing the principles of animism – reverence for all living beings, stewardship of the earth, and gratitude for the gifts of nature – we can cultivate a deeper sense of belonging, purpose, and interconnectedness with the world around us. Through the lens of mythology, we can explore the timeless themes of creation, destruction, transformation, and renewal that echo through the ages, inviting us to reflect on the mysteries of existence and the enduring power of storytelling to illuminate the human experience.""","981"
"Ingersoll Ernest","""The matter taken out, and containing the gold is piled up until spring, when the torrents come down, and is panned and cradled by these. It is certainly very hard labor.' Another quotation may be given as a practical example of this process: 'The gold so far as has been taken from Bonanza and Eldorado, both well named, for the richness of the placers are truly marvelous. Eldorado, thirty miles long, is staked the whole length and as far as worked has paid. 'One of our passengers, who is taking home $00,00 with him, has worked one hundred feet of his ground and refused $00,00 for the remainder, and confidently expects to clean up $00,00 and more. He has in a bottle $12 from one pan of dirt. His pay dirt while being washed averaged $5/80 an hour to each man shoveling in. Two others of our miners who worked their own claim cleaned up $,00 from one day's washing. 'There is about fifteen feet of dirt above bed rock, the pay streak averaging from four to six feet, which is tunnelled out while the ground is frozen. Of course, the ground taken out is thawed by building fires, and when the thaw comes and water rushes in they set their sluices and wash the dirt. Two of our fellows thought a small bird in the hand worth a large one in the bush, and sold their claims for $5/8,00, getting $,00 down, and the remainder to be paid in monthly installments of $0,00 each. The purchasers had no more than $,00 paid. They were twenty days thawing and getting out dirt. Then there was no water to sluice with, but one fellow made a rocker, and in ten days took out the $0,00 for the first installment. So, tunnelling and rocking, they took out $0,00 before there was water to sluice with.' OF. Commissioner Hermann, of the General Land Office, has announced that the following laws of the United States extend over Alaska, where the general land laws do not apply: First--The mineral land laws of the United States. Second--Town-site laws, which provide for the incorporation of town-sites and acquirement of title thereto from the United States Government by the town-site trustees. Third--The laws providing for trade and manufactures, giving each qualified person 60 acres of land in a square and compact form. The coal land regulations are distinct from the mineral regulations or laws, and as in the case of the general land laws Alaska is expressly exempt from this jurisdiction. On the part of Canada, however, the provisions of the Real Property act of the Northwest Territories will be extended to the Yukon country by an order in council, a register will be appointed, and a land title office will be established. The act approved May 7, 884, providing a civil government for Alaska, has this language as to mines and mining privileges: 'The laws of the United States relating to mining claims and rights incidental thereto shall, on and after the passage of this act, be in full force and effect in said district of Alaska, subject to such regulations as may be made by the Secretary of the Interior and approved by the President,' and 'parties who have located mines or mining privileges therein, under the United States laws applicable to the public domain, or have occupied or improved or exercised acts of ownership over such claims, shall not be disturbed therein, but shall be allowed to perfect title by payment so provided for.' There is still more general authority. Without the special authority, the act of July, 866, says: 'All valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States, both surveyed and unsurveyed, are hereby declared to be free and open to exploration and purchase, and lands in which these are found to occupation and purchase by citizens of the United States and by those who have declared an intention to become such, under the rules prescribed by law and according to local customs or rules of miners in the several mining districts, so far as the same are applicable and not inconsistent with the laws of the United States.' The patenting of mineral lands in Alaska is not a new thing, for that work has been going on, as the cases have come in from time to time, since 884. One of the difficulties that local capitalists find in their negotiations for purchase of mining properties on the Yukon is the lack of authenticated records of owners of claims. Different practices prevail on the two sides of the line and cause more or less confusion. The practice has been at most of the new camps to call a miners' meeting at which one of the parties was elected recorder, and he proceeded to enter the bearings of stakes and natural marks to define claims. Sometimes the recorder would give a receipt for a fee allowed by common consent for recording, and also keep a copy for future reference, but in a majority of cases even this formality was dispensed with, and the only record kept was the rough minutes made at the time. On the Canadian side a different state of affairs exists. The Dominion Government has sent a commissioner who is empowered to report officially all claims, and while no certificate is issued to the owners thereof, properties are thoroughly defined and their metes and bounds established. The commissioner in the Klondike district, whose name is Constantine, also exercises semi-judicial functions, and settles disputes to the best of his ability, appeal lying to the Ottawa Government. As to courts and the execution of civil and criminal law generally, none were existent in the upper Yukon Valley on the American side of the line during 897. The nearest United States judge was at Sitka. At Circle City and other centers of population the people had organized into a sort of town-meeting for the few public matters required; and a sort of vigilance committee took the place of constituted authority and police. As a matter of fact, however, the people were quiet and law-abiding and little need for the machinery of law is likely to arise before courts, etc., are set up. A movement toward sending a garrison of United States troops thither was vetoed by the War Department. Canada, however, awoke to the realization that her interests were in jeopardy, and took early steps to profit by the wealth which had been discovered within her borders and the international business that resulted. The natural feeling among the Canadians was, and is, that the property belongs to the Canadian public, and that no good reason exists why the mineral and other wealth should be exhausted at once, mainly by outsiders, as has largely happened in the case of Canada's forests. A prohibitory policy was urged by some, but this seemed neither wise nor practicable; and the Dominion Government set at work to save as large a share as it could. As there are gold fields on the Alaska side of the line, and the approaches lie through United States territory, a spirit of reciprocal accommodation was necessary. One difficulty has been averted last spring by President Cleveland's veto of the Immigration bill, one provision of which would have prevented Canadian laborers drawing wages in this country, and probably would have provoked a retaliatory act. Canada has already placed customs officers on the passes and at the Yukon crossing of the boundary to collect customs duties not only on merchandise but on miner's personal outfits. There is practically no exception, and the duty comes below 0 per cent. on but few articles. On most of the goods the duty is from 0 to 5/8 per cent., and in several instances higher, but the matter may be very simply adjusted by purchasing tools and outfits in Victoria or Vancouver, for thus far the United States has placed no corresponding obstruction in the way of Canadian travellers to the gold-fields, but, on the contrary, has made Dyea a sub-port of entry, largely to accommodate British transportation lines. The Canadian Government is represented in that region now only by customs officers and 0 mounted police, but it is taking steps to garrison the whole upper Yukon Valley with its mounted police,--a body of officers, whose functions are half military, half civil, and which, it may as well be conceded once for all, cannot be trifled with. There is no question but that they will do their level best to enforce the laws to the utmost. The commander of each detachment will be constituted a magistrate of limited powers, so that civil examinations and trials may be speedily conducted. The plan is to erect a strong post a short distance north of the sixtieth degree of latitude, just above the northern boundary of British Columbia, and beyond the head of the Lynn Canal, where the Chilkoot Pass and the White Pass converge. This post will command the southern entrance to the whole of that territory. Further on small police posts will be established, about fifty miles apart, down to Fort Selkirk, while another general post will patrol the river near the international boundary, with headquarters, probably, in the Klondike valley. The mining regulations of Canada, applying to the Yukon placer claims, are as follows: 'Bar diggings' shall mean any part of a river over which water extends when the water is in its flooded state and which is not covered at low water. 'Mines on benches' shall be known as bench diggings, and shall for the purpose of defining the size of such claims be excepted from dry diggings. 'Dry diggings' shall mean any mine over which a river never extends. 'Miner' shall mean a male or female over the age of eighteen, but not under that age. 'Claims' shall mean the personal right of property in a placer mine or diggings during the time for which the grant of such mine or diggings is made. 'Legal post' shall mean a stake standing not less than four feet above the ground and squared on four sides for at least one foot from the top.""","""Gold mining practices in Alaska""","2033","""Gold mining in Alaska has a rich history dating back to the late 1800s when prospectors rushed to the state in search of their fortunes. Today, Alaska remains a significant player in the gold mining industry, known for its vast mineral resources and diverse mining practices. From placer mining to hard rock mining, the state's gold mining operations showcase a blend of traditional methods and modern technologies that enable miners to extract gold in an efficient and environmentally conscious manner.  Placer mining is one of the most common methods used in Alaska, particularly in the western part of the state where significant gold deposits are found in rivers and streams. This type of mining involves the use of simple tools such as sluice boxes, gold pans, and dredges to extract gold particles from alluvial deposits. Miners rely on the natural erosion processes that have concentrated gold along riverbeds over millions of years. The ease of access and relatively low cost of entry make placer mining an attractive option for small-scale miners and hobbyists looking to try their luck in Alaska's goldfields.  Dredging is a popular form of placer mining in Alaska, where miners use floating dredges to extract gold-bearing gravel from river bottoms. These massive machines can process large amounts of material, separating out the gold through a series of sluice boxes and riffles. While dredging can be highly productive, concerns have been raised about its environmental impact, particularly on salmon habitats and water quality. To address these concerns, regulations have been put in place to limit the use of dredges in certain waterways and to minimize their effects on aquatic ecosystems.  Hard rock mining, on the other hand, involves extracting gold from solid rock formations deep underground. This method requires more sophisticated equipment and techniques compared to placer mining. In Alaska, hard rock mining operations are prevalent in areas like the Fairbanks mining district and the Juneau gold belt. Miners use drilling rigs, explosives, and underground machinery to access gold-bearing ore bodies buried beneath the earth's surface. Once the ore is brought to the surface, it is processed using various methods to extract the gold, such as crushing, grinding, and chemical leaching.  Modern gold mining operations in Alaska prioritize environmental stewardship and sustainability. Mines are required to adhere to strict regulations set forth by state and federal agencies to minimize their impact on the surrounding ecosystems. Reclamation efforts play a crucial role in restoring mined areas to their natural state once mining activities have ceased. This involves rehabilitating the land, replanting native vegetation, and monitoring water quality to ensure that wildlife habitats are preserved and water sources remain clean.  Technological advancements have revolutionized the gold mining industry in Alaska, enabling miners to operate more efficiently and safely. Innovations such as drone surveys, underground mapping software, and automated equipment have streamlined mining operations and improved worker safety. Additionally, advancements in gold recovery techniques, such as carbon-in-pulp processing and cyanide leaching, have helped increase the overall gold yield and minimize waste in the extraction process.  Alaska's gold mining industry not only contributes to the state's economy but also plays a vital role in its cultural heritage. Many Alaska Native communities have a long history of gold mining and continue to be involved in the industry today. Mining companies often work closely with these communities to ensure that their operations are conducted in a socially responsible manner that respects indigenous rights and traditions.  In conclusion, gold mining in Alaska is a dynamic and multifaceted industry that blends traditional practices with modern technologies.

"Kierkegaard Søren","""But in order to make it entirely clear, and bring it home to our minds, that the pause is given by him who invites, that it is he who gives us pause and renders it by no means an easy, but a peculiarly difficult, matter to follow his invitation, because one has no right to accept it without accepting also him who invites--in order to make this entirely clear I shall briefly review his life under two aspects which, to be sure, show some difference though both essentially pertain to his abasement. For it is always an abasement for God to become man, even if he were to be an emperor of emperors; and therefore he is not essentially more abased because he is a poor, lowly man, mocked, and as Scripture adds, spat upon. THE OF HIS LIFE And now let us speak about him in a homely fashion, just as his contemporaries spoke about him, and as one speaks about some contemporary--let him be a man of the same kind as we are, whom one meets on the street in passing, of whom one knows where he lives and in what story, what his business is, who his parents are, his family, how he looks and how he dresses, with whom he associates, 'and there is nothing extraordinary about him, he looks as men generally look'; in short, let us speak of him as one speaks of some contemporary about whom one does not make a great ado; for in living life together with these thousands upon thousands of real people there is no room for a fine distinction like this: 'Possibly, this man will be remembered in centuries to come,' and 'at the same time he is really only a clerk in some shop who is no whit better than his fellows.' Therefore, let us speak about him as contemporaries speak about some contemporary. I know very well what I am doing; and I want you to believe that the canting and indolent world-historic habit we have of always reverently speaking about reverent habit, I assure you, is not worth a row of pins but is, rather, sheer thoughtlessness, hypocrisy, and as such blasphemy; for it is blasphemy to reverence thoughtlessly him whom one is either to believe in or to be offended in. It is the lowly Jesus Christ, a humble man, born of a maiden of low degree, whose father is a carpenter. To be sure, his appearance is made under conditions which are bound to attract attention to him. The small nation among whom he appears, God's Chosen People as they call themselves, live in anticipation of a Messiah who is to bring a golden period to land and people. You must grant that the form in which he appears is as different as possible from what most people would have expected. On the other hand, his appearance corresponds more to the ancient prophecies with which the people are thought to have been familiar. Thus he presents himself. A predecessor has called attention to him, and he himself fastens attention very decidedly on himself by signs and wonders which are noised abroad in all the land--and he is the hero of the hour, surrounded by unnumbered multitudes of people wheresoever he fares. The sensation aroused by him is enormous, every one's eyes are fastened on him, every one who can go about, aye even those who can only crawl, must see the wonder--and every one must have some opinion about him, so that the purveyors of ready-made opinions are put to it because the demand is so furious and the contradictions so confusing. And yet he, the worker of miracles, ever remains the humble man who literally hath not where to lay his head. And let us not forget: signs and wonders as contemporary events have a markedly greater elasticity in repelling or attracting than the tame stories generally re-hashed by the priests, or the still tamer stories about signs and wonders that happened--800 years ago! Signs and wonders as contemporary events are something plaguy and importunate, something which in a highly embarrassing manner almost compels one to have an opinion, something which, if one does not happen to be disposed to believe, may exasperate one excessively by thus forcing one to be contemporaneous with it. Indeed, it renders existence too complicated, and the more so, the more thoughtful, developed, and cultured one is. It is a peculiarly ticklish matter, this having to assume that a man who is contemporaneous with one really performs signs and wonders; but when he is at some distance from one, when the consequences of his life stimulate the imagination a bit, then it is not so hard to imagine, in a fashion, that one believes it. As I said, then, the people are carried away with him; they follow him jubilantly, and see signs and wonders, both those which he performs and those which he does not perform, and they are glad in their hope that the golden age will begin, once he is king. But the crowd rarely have a clear reason for their opinions, they think one thing today and another tomorrow. Therefore the wise and the critical will not at once participate. Let us see now what the wise and the critical must think, so soon as the first impression of astonishment and surprise has subsided. The shrewd and critical man would probably say: 'Even assuming that this person is what he claims to be, that is, something extraordinary--for as to his affirming himself to be God I can, of course, not consider that as anything but an exaggeration for which I willingly make allowances, and pardon him, if I really considered him to be something extraordinary; for I am not a pedant--assuming then, which I hesitate to do, for it is a matter on which I shall at any rate suspend my judgment--assuming then that he is really performing miracles: is it not an inexplicable mystery that this person can be so foolish, so weak-minded, so altogether devoid of worldly wisdom, so feeble, or so good-naturedly vain, or whatever else you please to call it--that he behaves in this fashion and almost forces his benefactions on men? Instead of proudly and commandingly keeping people away from himself at a distance marked by their profoundest submission, whenever he does allow himself to be seen, at rare occasions: instead of doing so, think of his being accessible to every one, or rather himself going to every one, of having intercourse with everybody, almost as if being the extraordinary person consisted in his being everybody's servant, as if the extraordinary person he claims to be were marked by his being concerned only lest men should fail to be benefited by him--in short as if being an extraordinary person consisted in being the most solicitous of all persons. The whole business is inexplicable to me--what he wants, what his purpose is, what end he has in mind, what he expects to accomplish; in a word, what the meaning of it all is. He who by so many a wise saying reveals so profound an insight into the human heart, he must certainly know what I, using but half of my wits, can predict for him, viz. that in such fashion one gets nowhere in the world--unless, indeed, despising prudence, one consistently, aims to make a fool of one's self or, perchance, goes so far in sincerity as to prefer being put to death; but anyone, one desiring that must certainly be crazy. Having such profound knowledge of the human heart he certainly ought to know that the thing to do is to deceive people and then to give one's deception the appearance of being a benefaction conferred on the whole race. By doing so one reaps all advantages, even the one whose enjoyment is the sweetest of all, which is, to be called by one's contemporaries a benefactor of the human race--for, once in your grave, you may snap your fingers at what posterity may have to say about you. But to surrender one's self altogether, as he does, and not to think the least of one's self--in fact, almost to beg people to accept these benefactions: no, I would not dream of joining his company. And, of course, neither does he invite me; for, indeed, he invites only them that labor and are heavy laden.' Or he would reason as follows: 'His life is simply a fantastic dream. In fact, that is the mildest expression one can use about it; for, when judging him in this fashion, one is good-natured enough to forget altogether the evidence of sheer madness in his claim to be God. This is wildly fantastical. One may possibly live a few years of one's youth in such fashion. But he is now past thirty years. And he is literally nothing. Still further, in a very short time he will necessarily lose all the respect and reputation he has gained among the people, the only thing, you may say, he has gained for himself. One who wishes to keep in the good graces of the people--the riskiest chance imaginable, I will admit--he must act differently. Not many months will pass before the crowd will grow tired of one who is so altogether at their service. He will be regarded as a ruined person, a kind of outcast, who ought to be glad to end his days in a corner, the world forgetting, by the world forgot; providing he does not, by continuing his previous behavior, prefer to maintain his present attitude and be fantastic enough to wish to be put to death, which is the unavoidable consequence of persevering in that course. What has he done for his future? Nothing. Has he any assured position? No. What expectations has he? None. Even this trifling matter: what will he do to pass the time when he grows older, the long winter nights, what will he do to make them pass--why, he cannot even play cards! He is now enjoying a bit of popular favor--in truth, of all movable property the most movable--which in a trice may turn into an enormous popular hatred of him.--Join his company? No, thank you, I am still, thank God, in my right mind.'""","""Nature of Jesus Christ's humility""","2093","""Humility is a trait revered across cultures and religions as a fundamental virtue that embodies a sense of modesty, selflessness, and meekness. In Christianity, the nature of Jesus Christ's humility serves as a cornerstone of his teachings and an exemplar for his followers. The humility of Jesus is profound and multifaceted, reflecting a deep sense of compassion, service, and submission to the will of God. Through his words, actions, and ultimately his sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus provides a powerful example of humility that has inspired countless individuals throughout history.  At the core of Jesus' humility is his recognition of his divine nature and his willingness to set aside his glory and heavenly position to dwell among humanity. The Gospel of John describes this divine condescension succinctly, stating, """"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us"""" (John 1:14). This profound act of humility is known as the Incarnation, where the Son of God took on human form to identify with our struggles, experiences, and limitations. By willingly embracing human frailty and mortality, Jesus demonstrated a radical humility that transcends human understanding.  Throughout his earthly ministry, Jesus consistently modeled humility in his interactions with others. He associated with the marginalized, the outcasts, and the sinners, showing no regard for social status or prestige. His parables often highlighted the virtue of humility, such as the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector, where the humble tax collector's contrite prayer is contrasted with the self-righteousness of the Pharisee (Luke 18:9-14). Jesus' teachings emphasized the importance of serving others, loving one's enemies, and putting the needs of others above oneself.  One of the most iconic examples of Jesus' humility is found in the Gospel of John, where he washes the feet of his disciples. This act, typically performed by a servant, shocked his followers and prompted Peter to object. Jesus responds, """"I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you"""" (John 13:15). This symbolic gesture illustrates Jesus' humility and servant leadership, challenging his disciples to embody a similar attitude of humility and service towards one another.  Beyond his interactions with individuals, the ultimate demonstration of Jesus' humility is seen in his sacrificial death on the cross. The Apostle Paul eloquently captures this self-emptying act in his letter to the Philippians, stating that Jesus, though being in very nature God, """"made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant"""" and humbled himself to the point of death, even death on a cross (Philippians 2:6-8). The crucifixion represents the culmination of Jesus' humility, where he willingly suffered and died for the redemption of humanity, bearing the weight of sin and offering ultimate reconciliation with God.  The humility of Jesus Christ serves as a profound example for Christians to emulate in their own lives. By following the model of humility set forth by Jesus, believers are called to cultivate a spirit of meekness, gentleness, and compassion towards others. This humility is not rooted in weakness or passivity but in a deep sense of strength, conviction, and love. It involves recognizing one's inherent worth as a child of God while also acknowledging the value and dignity of every individual, regardless of social status or background.  In contemporary society, the virtue of humility is often overshadowed by self-promotion, individualism, and pride. The example of Jesus challenges believers to resist the cultural norms of seeking recognition and validation and instead embrace a humble posture of service and compassion. Humility requires a radical shift in perspective, from a focus on self-interest to a genuine concern for the well-being of others. It involves listening attentively, speaking with grace, and extending forgiveness and grace to those who have wronged us.  Practicing humility in everyday life can take many forms, whether through acts of kindness, generosity, or simply listening with empathy. It requires a willingness to set aside personal ambitions and ego in order to prioritize the needs of others. By following Jesus' example of humility, individuals can foster deeper connections, promote understanding and reconciliation, and ultimately reflect the love and grace of God to those around them.  In conclusion, the nature of Jesus Christ's humility is a profound and transformative aspect of his character that continues to inspire and challenge believers today. Through his divine condescension, compassionate ministry, and sacrificial death, Jesus exemplified a humility that transcends human understanding and serves as a timeless model for how Christians are called to live. By embracing humility in word and deed, believers can cultivate a spirit of meekness, service, and love that reflects the very essence of Christ himself.""","961"
"Einstein Albert","""The more modern interpretation:--Geometry treats of entities which are denoted by the words straight line, point, etc. These entities do not take for granted any knowledge or intuition whatever, but they presuppose only the validity of the axioms, such as the one stated above, which are to be taken in a purely formal sense, i.e. as void of all content of intuition or experience. These axioms are free creations of the human mind. All other propositions of geometry are logical inferences from the nothing about the relations of real things, but only geometry together with the physical laws can do so. Using symbols, we may say that only the sum subject to the control of experience. be chosen arbitrarily, and also parts the whole together in accord with experience. Envisaged in this way, axiomatic geometry and the part of natural law which has been given a conventional status appear as epistemologically equivalent. Sub specie aeterni Poincare, in my opinion, is right. The idea of the measuring-rod and the idea of the clock co-ordinated with it in the theory of relativity do not find their exact correspondence in the real world. It is also clear that the solid body and the clock do not in the conceptual edifice of physics play the part of irreducible elements, but that of composite structures, which may not play any independent part in theoretical physics. But it is my conviction that in the present stage of development of theoretical physics these ideas must still be employed as independent ideas; for we are still far from possessing such certain knowledge of theoretical principles as to be able to give exact theoretical constructions of solid bodies and clocks. Further, as to the objection that there are no really rigid bodies in nature, and that therefore the properties predicated of rigid bodies do not apply to physical reality,--this objection is by no means so radical as might appear from a hasty examination. For it is not a difficult task to determine the physical state of a measuring-rod so accurately that its behaviour relatively to other measuring-bodies shall be sufficiently free from ambiguity to allow it to be substituted for the 'rigid' body. It is to measuring-bodies of this kind that statements as to rigid bodies must be referred. All practical geometry is based upon a principle which is accessible to experience, and which we will now try to realise. We will call that which is enclosed between two boundaries, marked upon a practically-rigid body, a tract. We imagine two practically-rigid bodies, each with a tract marked out on it. These two tracts are said to be 'equal to one another' if the boundaries of the one tract can be brought to coincide permanently with the boundaries of the other. We now assume that: If two tracts are found to be equal once and anywhere, they are equal always and everywhere. Not only the practical geometry of Euclid, but also its nearest generalisation, the practical geometry of Riemann, and therewith the general theory of relativity, rest upon this assumption. Of the experimental reasons which warrant this assumption I will mention only one. The phenomenon of the propagation of light in empty space assigns a tract, namely, the appropriate path of light, to each interval of local time, and conversely. Thence it follows that the above assumption for tracts must also hold good for intervals of clock-time in the theory of relativity. Consequently it may be formulated as follows:--If two ideal clocks are going at the same rate at any time and at any place (being then in immediate proximity to each other), they will always go at the same rate, no matter where and when they are again compared with each other at one place.--If this law were not valid for real clocks, the proper frequencies for the separate atoms of the same chemical element would not be in such exact agreement as experience demonstrates. The existence of sharp spectral lines is a convincing experimental proof of the above-mentioned principle of practical geometry. This is the ultimate foundation in fact which enables us to speak with meaning of the mensuration, in Riemann's sense of the word, of the four-dimensional continuum of space-time. The question whether the structure of this continuum is Euclidean, or in accordance with Riemann's general scheme, or otherwise, is, according to the view which is here being advocated, properly speaking a physical question which must be answered by experience, and not a question of a mere convention to be selected on practical grounds.""","""Geometry and Theoretical Physics Principles""","906","""Geometry and theoretical physics may seem like two distinct branches of science, yet they share a deep and fascinating connection that has played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of the universe. Geometry, the study of shapes, sizes, and properties of space, has long been intertwined with theoretical physics, the branch of physics that seeks to understand the natural world through mathematical models and principles. In this intricate relationship, geometry serves as a fundamental tool for theoretical physicists to describe the fabric of the cosmos and the underlying laws that govern it.  One of the key areas where geometry and theoretical physics converge is in the concept of space-time. In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein revolutionized our understanding of the universe with his theory of general relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of space-time caused by massive objects. In this theory, space and time are not separate entities but are interconnected in a four-dimensional continuum. The mathematics used to represent this curvature is based on the principles of differential geometry, a branch of mathematics that deals with smooth surfaces and spaces.  Differential geometry provides theoretical physicists with the tools to study the dynamics of space-time and the behavior of matter and energy within it. By using concepts such as tensors, manifolds, and curvature, physicists can formulate equations that describe the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies and the bending of light around massive objects. These mathematical tools help physicists make predictions about astronomical phenomena such as black holes, gravitational waves, and the expanding universe.  Another profound connection between geometry and theoretical physics lies in the concept of symmetry. Symmetry, the idea that certain operations or transformations leave an object unchanged, plays a crucial role in both fields. In theoretical physics, symmetries are deeply linked to conservation laws and fundamental interactions. For instance, Emmy Noether's theorem establishes a profound connection between symmetries and conservation laws, showing that for every continuous symmetry in a physical system, there exists a corresponding conserved quantity.  The study of symmetries in physics often involves group theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties of mathematical groups. Groups are mathematical structures that capture the notion of symmetry and transformation, making them indispensable in describing the fundamental forces of nature. The Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces, relies heavily on the symmetries of a mathematical group known as SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1).  Geometry also plays a central role in the study of string theory, a theoretical framework that attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. In string theory, the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles but rather tiny, vibrating strings. These strings propagate in a space-time with additional dimensions beyond the familiar three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. The mathematical formulation of string theory requires advanced tools from differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and topology to describe the interactions of strings in higher-dimensional spaces.  Topology, another branch of mathematics closely related to geometry, is essential in theoretical physics for studying the properties of space that remain unchanged under continuous deformations. In the context of field theories and condensed matter physics, topological concepts such as Chern-Simons theory and topological insulators have led to groundbreaking discoveries in understanding exotic phases of matter and emergent phenomena.  In conclusion, the marriage of geometry and theoretical physics has led to profound insights into the workings of the universe, from the curvature of space-time to the symmetries of fundamental forces and the exotic realms of string theory. The elegant language of mathematics serves as a bridge between these disciplines, allowing physicists to explore the depths of reality and unlock the mysteries of the cosmos through geometric reasoning and theoretical rigor. By embracing the interconnected nature of these disciplines, scientists continue to push the boundaries of knowledge and unravel the intricate tapestry of the universe.""","762"
"Brawley Benjamin Griffith","""Since 913 Shaw University, Bishop College, and Benedict College have also become members. The general aim of the organization has been to bring more closely together the colleges concerned for the consideration of such subjects as uniform requirements for entrance to college, the requirements for the college degree, the reception of students from other colleges, and other topics of vital interest. All such things denote progress. And yet, when all consideration is given to the advance that has been made, there are those who feel that with the opportunity still more should have been done. They feel that the past is irrevocable, but that it is not too late to correct certain errors and tendencies for the future. What is the situation as we actually find it to-day? Go to any one of the most representative institutions, and what do we find? Efficient teachers struggling against most enormous disadvantages and frequently dealing with the crudest possible material. The wonder is that so much has been accomplished in the face of the handicap. It is not enough to reply that in all the schools and colleges of the country the teaching is irregular and the systems too lenient--that there is no human perfection in fact; these Negro colleges are crying for a better chance and they ought to have it. Go into any one of their high school until he found some form of exercise into which the boy would enter with enthusiasm and which would save him from undue introspection and generally look to his physical well-being. Whatever may be the special field, the training should be absolutely thorough. We should rather see a boy plane a board correctly than have him work a problem in trigonometry incorrectly; and on the other hand we should rather see a student construe Homer with precision than keep a dairy that is not perfectly clean. Any such education as this of course calls for experts, and we are thus led on to our second point. We ask that the teachers in Negro schools and colleges should in deed and in truth be specialists. He who would teach any American youth in the new day, and certainly any Negro American youth, should be a genuine psychologist and sociologist and a large-hearted Christian man at the same time that he is a most thorough student in his own department. By 'specialist' we do not mean a man who in English would count up the infinitives in Gower's poems, but one who in grammar, for instance, could bring from a broad scholarly background such a capacity for illustration as would inspire his students to be honestly more careful in their speaking or writing. The teacher of geometry would be one who could genuinely teach boys to think better; and with the true teacher of Latin, boys would have no desire to be dishonest. Whatever is taught should be dynamic; now as never before it must justify itself in terms of human life. Such instructors for our youth would call for such an outlay for education as has not yet been dreamed of.""","""Education in Negro colleges""","580","""Education in Negro colleges has a rich history that played a significant role in advancing the African American community in the United States. These institutions, historically known as Negro colleges, were established during a time when racial segregation and discrimination prevailed in the country. Despite facing immense challenges, Negro colleges persevered and provided opportunities for Black individuals to pursue higher education.  One of the most notable aspects of Negro colleges was their dedication to providing quality education to African American students who were often denied access to mainstream educational institutions. These colleges played a crucial role in fostering academic excellence, promoting cultural awareness, and nurturing leadership skills among Black students.  In the face of adversity, Negro colleges succeeded in creating a supportive and empowering environment for their students. The faculty and staff at these colleges were not only educators but also mentors and advocates who encouraged students to excel academically and become agents of change in their communities. This personalized approach to education helped students develop a strong sense of identity and purpose.  Moreover, Negro colleges played a vital role in preserving and promoting African American culture and heritage. These institutions recognized the importance of celebrating Black history and achievements, which was often overlooked in mainstream educational curricula. By incorporating African American literature, history, and art into their programs, Negro colleges instilled pride and a sense of belonging in their students.  Furthermore, Negro colleges served as centers of activism and social change. Students and faculty at these institutions played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement, advocating for desegregation and equal rights for all. The education provided at Negro colleges empowered students to challenge systemic racism and inequality, leading to significant progress in the fight for social justice.  Over the years, Negro colleges have evolved into diverse and inclusive institutions that welcome students from all backgrounds. While the term """"Negro colleges"""" is no longer in common use, the legacy of these institutions lives on in the form of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). HBCUs continue to serve as beacons of hope and opportunity for students seeking a supportive and culturally rich educational experience.  In conclusion, education in Negro colleges played a critical role in shaping the lives of countless African American individuals and advancing the cause of civil rights in the United States. These institutions provided more than just academic instruction; they instilled values of resilience, empowerment, and community engagement in their students. As we reflect on the history of Negro colleges, we must recognize and appreciate the enduring impact they have had on the lives of generations of students and society as a whole.""","496"
"Marsh George P  George Perkins ","""Birds accompany ships on long voyages, for the sake of the offal which is thrown overboard, and, in such cases, it might often happen that they would breed and become naturalized in countries where they had been unknown before. There is a familiar story of an English bird which built its nest in an unused block in the rigging of a ship, and made one or two short voyages with the vessel while hatching its eggs. Had the young become fledged while lying in a foreign harbor, they would of course have claimed the rights of citizenship in the country where they first took to the wing. Some enthusiastic entomologist will, perhaps, by and by discover that insects and worms are as essential as the larger organisms to the proper working of the great terraqueous machine, and we shall have as eloquent pleas in defence of the mosquito, and perhaps even of the tzetze fly, as Toussenel and Michelet have framed in behalf of the bird. The silkworm and the bee need no apologist; a gallnut produced by the puncture of an insect on a Syrian oak is a necessary ingredient in the ink I am writing with, and from my windows I recognize the grain of the kermes and the cochineal in the gay habiliments of the holiday groups beneath them. But agriculture, too, is indebted to the insect and the worm. The ancients, according to Pliny, were accustomed to hang branches of the wild fig upon the domestic tree, in order that the insects which frequented the former might hasten the ripening of the cultivated fig by their punctures--or, as others suppose, might fructify it by transporting to it the pollen of the wild fruit--and this process, called caprification, is not yet entirely obsolete. The earthworms long ago made good their title to the respect and gratitude of the farmer as well as of the angler. The utility of the earthworms has been pointed out in many scientific as well as in many agricultural treatises. The following extract, cut from a newspaper, will answer my present purpose: 'Mr. Josiah Parkes, the consulting engineer of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, says that worms are great assistants to the drainer, and valuable aids to the farmer in keeping up the fertility of the soil. He says they love moist, but not wet soils; they will bore down to, but not into water; they multiply rapidly on land after drainage, and prefer a deeply dried soil. On examining with Mr. Thomas Hammond, of Penhurst, Kent, part of a field which he had deeply drained, after long-previous shallow drainage, he found that the worms had greatly increased in number, and that their bores descended quite to the level of the pipes. Many worm bores were large enough to receive the little finger. Mr. Henry Handley had informed him of a piece of land near the sea in Lincolnshire, over which the sea had broken and killed all the worms--the field remained sterile until the worms again inhabited it. He also showed him a piece of pasture land near to his house, in which worms were in such numbers that he thought their casts interfered too much with its produce, which induced him to have it rolled at night in order to destroy the worms. The result was, that the fertility of the field greatly declined, nor was it restored until they had recruited their numbers, which was aided by collecting and transporting multitudes of worms from the fields. 'The great depth into which worms will bore, and from which they push up fine fertile soil, and cast it on the surface, has been admirably traced by Mr. C. Darwin, of Down, Kent, who has shown that in a few years they have actually elevated the surface of fields by a large layer of rich mould, several inches thick--thus affording nourishment to the roots of grasses, and increasing the productiveness of the soil.' It should be added that the writer quoted, and others who have discussed the subject, have overlooked one very important element in the fertilization produced by earthworms. I refer to the enrichment of the soil by their excreta during life, and by the decomposition of their remains when they die. The manure thus furnished is as valuable as the like amount of similar animal products derived from higher organisms, and when we consider the prodigious numbers of these worms found on a single square yard of some soils, we may easily see that they furnish no insignificant contribution to the nutritive material required for the growth of plants. The perforations of the earthworm mechanically affect the texture of the soil and its permeability by water, and they therefore have a certain influence on the form and character of surface. But the geographical importance of insects proper, as well as of worms, depends principally on their connection with vegetable life as agents of its fecundation, and of its destruction. I am acquainted with no single fact so strikingly illustrative of this importance, as the following statement which I take from a notice of Darwin's volume, On Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilized by Insects, in the Saturday Review, of October 8, 862: 'The net result is, that some six thousand species of orchids are absolutely dependent upon the agency of insects for their fertilization. That is to say, were those plants unvisited by insects, they would all rapidly disappear.' What is true of the orchids is more or less true of many other vegetable families. We do not know the limits of this agency, and many of the insects habitually regarded as unqualified pests, may directly or indirectly perform functions as important to the most valuable plants as the services rendered by certain tribes to the orchids. I say directly or indirectly, because, besides the other arrangements of nature for checking the undue multiplication of particular species, she has established a police among insects themselves, by which some of them keep down or promote the increase of others; for there are insects, as well as birds and beasts, of prey. The existence of an insect which fertilizes a useful vegetable may depend on that of another, which constitutes his food in some stage of his life, and this other again may be as injurious to some plant as his destroyer is beneficial to another. The equation of animal and vegetable life is too complicated a problem for human intelligence to solve, and we can never know how wide a circle of disturbance we produce in the harmonies of nature when we throw the smallest pebble into the ocean of organic life. This much, however, we seem authorized to conclude: as often as we destroy the balance by deranging the original proportions between different orders of spontaneous life, the law of self-preservation requires us to restore the equilibrium, by either directly returning the weight abstracted from one scale, or removing a corresponding quantity from the other. In other words, destruction must be either repaired by reproduction, or compensated by new destruction in an opposite quarter. The parlor aquarium has taught even those to whom it is but an amusing toy, that the balance of animal and vegetable life must be preserved, and that the excess of either is fatal to the other, in the artificial tank as well as in natural waters. A few years ago, the water of the Cochituate aqueduct at Boston became so offensive in smell and taste as to be quite unfit for use. Scientific investigation found the cause in the too scrupulous care with which aquatic vegetation had been excluded from the reservoir, and the consequent death and decay of the animalcul which could not be shut out, nor live in the water without the vegetable element. Introduction of Insects. The general tendency of man's encroachments upon spontaneous nature has been to increase insect life at the expense of vegetation and of the smaller quadrupeds and birds. Doubtless there are insects in all woods, but in temperate climates they are comparatively few and harmless, and the most numerous tribes which breed in the forest, or rather in its waters, and indeed in all solitudes, are those which little injure vegetation, such as mosquitoes, gnats, and the like. With the cultivated plants of man come the myriad tribes which feed or breed upon them, and agriculture not only introduces new species, but so multiplies the number of individuals as to defy calculation. Newly introduced vegetables frequently escape for years the insect plagues which had infested them in their native habitat; but the importation of other varieties of the plant, the exchange of seed, or some mere accident, is sure in the long run to carry the egg, the larva, or the chrysalis to the most distant shores where the plant assigned to it by nature as its possession has preceded it. For many years after the colonization of the United States, few or none of the insects which attack wheat in its different stages of growth, were known in America. During the Revolutionary war, the Hessian fly, Cecidomyia destructor, made its appearance, and it was so called because it was first observed in the year when the Hessian troops were brought over, and was popularly supposed to have been accidentally imported by those unwelcome strangers. Other destroyers of cereal grains have since found their way across the Atlantic, and a noxious European aphis has first attacked the American wheatfields within the last four or five years. Unhappily, in these cases of migration, the natural corrective of excessive multiplication, the parasitic or voracious enemy of the noxious insect, does not always accompany the wanderings of its prey, and the bane long precedes the antidote. Hence, in the United States, the ravages of imported insects injurious to cultivated crops, not being checked by the counteracting influences which nature had provided to limit their devastations in the Old World, are much more destructive than in Europe.""","""Insects and their ecological significance""","2015","""Insects, despite their small size, play a crucial role in ecosystems around the world. With over a million described species and potentially millions more awaiting discovery, insects are among the most diverse group of organisms on Earth. Their ecological significance cannot be overstated, as they contribute to various ecosystem functions that are essential for maintaining the balance of nature.  One of the most fundamental roles insects play in ecosystems is that of decomposers. Insects such as beetles, ants, and flies break down organic matter, including dead plants and animals, into simpler compounds. This process of decomposition is vital for nutrient recycling, as it releases essential elements like nitrogen and phosphorus back into the soil, making them available for plants to use. Without insects performing this critical function, organic matter would accumulate, and essential nutrients would be locked away, leading to a breakdown in nutrient cycles.  Pollination is another key ecological service provided by insects. Approximately 75% of flowering plants rely on animals for pollination, and insects are the most effective pollinators. Bees, butterflies, beetles, and other insects transfer pollen from one flower to another as they forage for nectar. This process is essential for the reproduction of many plant species, including numerous crops that humans depend on for food. Without insect pollinators, many plants would not be able to produce fruits and seeds, leading to a decline in biodiversity and potential food shortages.  Insects also play a significant role in controlling pest populations. Predatory insects such as ladybugs, lacewings, and mantises help keep herbivorous insect populations in check by preying on them. This natural pest control reduces the need for chemical pesticides, which can have harmful effects on non-target species and the environment. By maintaining a balance between herbivorous and predatory insects, ecosystems can remain healthy and stable.  Furthermore, insects are a crucial food source for numerous other organisms. Birds, amphibians, reptiles, and even mammals rely on insects as a primary food source. Insects contribute to the intricate food webs that sustain life in various ecosystems. Their abundance and diversity make them a readily available and energy-rich food source for many creatures, forming the foundation of numerous terrestrial and aquatic food chains.  In addition to their direct ecological roles, insects also serve as indicators of environmental health. Due to their sensitivity to changes in the environment, such as pollution, habitat loss, and climate change, shifts in insect populations can signal broader ecological shifts. Monitoring insect populations can provide valuable insights into the health of ecosystems and help identify environmental issues that require attention. Declines in insect populations have been observed in many regions, raising concerns about the potential consequences for ecosystem functioning.  Insects also contribute to soil health through activities such as burrowing, aeration, and nutrient cycling. Termites, ants, and beetles, among other insects, help break up soil, allowing air and water to penetrate, which promotes plant growth. Through their tunneling and feeding activities, insects play a vital role in soil structure and fertility, further highlighting their importance in ecosystem dynamics.  While the ecological significance of insects is undeniable, they face numerous threats that jeopardize their populations and the services they provide. Habitat destruction, pesticide use, climate change, and invasive species are putting immense pressure on insect populations worldwide. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these vital organisms and ensure the continued functioning of ecosystems.  In conclusion, insects are integral to the functioning of ecosystems, contributing to processes such as decomposition, pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling. Their importance extends far beyond their size, influencing the health and stability of ecosystems at a global scale. Recognizing and valuing the ecological significance of insects is essential for conserving biodiversity, promoting sustainable agriculture, and maintaining a healthy planet for future generations.""","756"
"Marsh W Lockwood William Lockwood ","""Developing from the Vee type, the eighteen-cylinder 75/8 brake horse-power engine, designed during the war, represented for a time the limit of power obtainable from a single plant. It was water-cooled throughout, and the ignition to each cylinder was duplicated; this engine proved fully efficient, and economical in fuel consumption. It was largely used for seaplane work, where reliability was fully as necessary as high power. The abnormal needs of the war period brought many British firms into the ranks of Vee-type engine-builders, and, apart from those mentioned, the most notable types produced are the Rolls-Royce and the Napier. The first mentioned of these firms, previous to 914 had concentrated entirely on car engines, and their very high standard of production in this department of internal combustion engine work led, once they took up the making of aero engines, to extreme efficiency both of design and workmanship. The first experimental aero engine, of what became known as the 'Eagle' type, was of Vee design--it was completed in March of 915/8--and was so successful that it was standardised for quantity production. How far the original was from the perfection subsequently ascertained is shown by the steady increase in developed horse-power of the type; originally designed to develop 00 horse-power, it was developed and improved before its first practical trial in October of 915/8, when it developed 5/85/8 horsepower on a brake test. Research and experiment produced still further improvements, for, without any enlargement of the dimensions, or radical alteration in design, the power of the engine was brought up to 66 horse-power by March of 916, the rate of revolutions of,00 per minute being maintained throughout. July, 916 gave 84 horse-power; by the cud of the year this had been increased to 22 horse-power; by September of 917 the increase was to 5/80 horse-power, and by February of 918 then 'Eagle' type of engine was rated at 60 horse-power, at which standard it stayed. But there is no more remarkable development in engine design than this, a 5/8 per cent increase of power in the same engine in a period of less than three years. To meet the demand for a smaller type of engine for use on training machines, the Rolls-Royce firm produced the 'Hawk' Vee-type engine of 00 horsepower, and, intermediately between this and the 'Eagle,' the 'Falcon' engine came to being with an original rated horse-power of 05/8 at,00 revolutions per minute, in April of 916. Here was another case of growth of power in the same engine through research, almost similar to that of the 'Eagle' type, for by July of 918 the 'Falcon' was developing 85/8 horse-power with no radical alteration of design. Finally, in response to the constant demand for increase of power in a single plant, the Rolls-Royce company designed and produced the 'Condor' type of engine, which yielded 00 horse-power on its first test in August of 918. The cessation of hostilities and consequent falling off in the demand for extremely high-powered plants prevented the 'Condor' being developed to its limit, as had been the 'Falcon' and 'Eagle' types. The 'Eagle 'engine was fitted to the two Handley-Page aeroplanes--which made flights from England to India--it was virtually standard on the Handley-Page bombers of the later War period, though to a certain extent the American 'Liberty' engine was also used. Its chief record, however, is that of being the type fitted to the Vickers-Vimy aeroplane which made the first Atlantic flight, covering the distance of,80 miles at a speed averaging 17 miles an hour. The Napier Company specialised on one type of engine from the outset, a power plant which became known as the 'Lion' engine, giving 5/80 horse-power with twelve cylinders arranged in three rows of four each. Considering the engine as 'dry,' or without fuel and accessories, an abnormally light weight per horse-power--only.9 lbs.--was attained when running at the normal rate of revolution. The cylinders and water-jackets are of steel, and there is fitted a detachable aluminium cylinder head containing inlet and exhaust valves and valve actuating mechanism; pistons are of aluminium alloy, and there are two inlet and two exhaust valves to each cylinder, the whole of the valve mechanism being enclosed in an oil-tight aluminium case. Connecting rods and crankshaft are of steel, the latter being machined from a solid steel forging and carried in five roller bearings and one plain bearing at the forward end. The front end of the crank-case encloses reduction gear for the propeller shaft, together with the shaft and bearings. There are two suction and one pressure type oil pumps driven through gears at half-engine speed, and two 2 spark magnetos, giving sparks in each cylinder. The cylinders are set with the central row vertical, and the two side rows at angles of 0 degrees each; cylinder bore is inches, and stroke inches; the normal rate of revolution is,5/80 per minute, and the reducing gear gives one revolution of the propeller shaft to.2 revolutions of crankshaft. Fuel consumption is.8lbs. of fuel per brake horse-power hour at full load, and oil consumption is.20 lbs. per brake horsepower hour. The dry weight of the engine, complete with propeller boss, carburettors, and induction pipes, is 5/80 lbs., and the gross weight in running order, with fuel and oil for six hours working, is,71 lbs., exclusive of cooling water. To this engine belongs an altitude record of 0,00 feet, made at Martlesham, near Ipswich, on January nd, 919, by Captain Lang, R.A.F., the climb being accomplished in 6 minutes 5/8 seconds. Previous to this, the altitude record was held by an Italian pilot, who made 5/8,00 feet in an hour and 7 minutes in 916. Lang's climb was stopped through the pressure of air, at the altitude he reached, being insufficient for driving the small propellers on the machine which worked the petrol and oil pumps, or he might have made the height said to have been attained by Major Schroeder on February 7th, 920, at Dayton, Ohio. Schroeder is said to have reached an altitude of 6,20 feet on a Napier biplane, and, owing to failure of the oxygen supply, to have lost consciousness, fallen five miles, righted his machine when,00 feet in the air, and alighted successfully. Major Schroeder is an American. Turning back a little, and considering other than British design of Vee and double-Vee or 'Broad arrow' type of engine, the Renault firm from the earliest days devoted considerable attention to the development of this type, their air-cooled engines having been notable examples from the earliest days of heavier-than-air machines. In 910 they were making three sizes of eight-cylindered Vee-type engines, and by 915/8 they had increased to the manufacture of five sizes, ranging from 5/8 to 00 brake horse-power, the largest of the five sizes having twelve cylinders but still retaining the air-cooled principle. The De Dion firm, also, made Vee-type engines in 914, being represented by an 0 horse-power eight-cylindered engine, air-cooled, and a 5/80 horse-power, also of eight cylinders, water-cooled, running at a normal rate of,00 revolutions per minute. Another notable example of French construction was the Panhard and Levassor 00 horse-power eight-cylinder Vee engine, developing its rated power at,00 revolutions per minute, and having the--for that time--low weight of. lbs. per horse-power. American Vee design has followed the British fairly cclosely; the Curtiss Company produced originally a 5/8 horse-power eight-cylinder Vee type running at,00 revolutions per minute, supplementing this with a 70 horse-power engine running at,00 revolutions per minute, and later with a twelve-cylinder model Vee type, developing 00 horse-power at,00 revolutions per minute, with cylinder bore of inches and stroke of inches. An exceptional type of American design was the Kemp Vee engine of 0 horse-power in which the cylinders were cooled by a current of air obtained from a fan at the forward end of the engine. With cylinders of.5/8 inches bore and.5/8 inches stroke, the rater power was developed at,5/80 revolutions per minute, and with the engine complete the weight was only.5/8 lbs. per horse-power. III. THE TYPE The very first successful design of internal combustion aero engine made was that of Charles Manly, who built a five-cylinder radial engine in 901 for use with Langley's 'aerodrome,' as the latter inventor decided to call what has since become known as the aeroplane. Manly made a number of experiments, and finally decided on radial design, in which the cylinders are so rayed round a central crank-pin that the pistons act successively upon it; by this arrangement a very short and compact engine is obtained, with a minimum of weight, and a regular crankshaft rotation and perfect balance of inertia forces. When Manly designed his radial engine, high speed internal combustion engines were in their infancy, and the difficulties in construction can be partly realised when the lack of manufacturing methods for this high-class engine work, and the lack of experimental data on the various materials, are taken into account. During its tests, Manly's engine developed 2. brake horsepower at a speed of 5/80 revolutions per minute, with the remarkably low weight of only. lbs. per horsepower; this latter was increased to. lbs.""","""Aero Engine Development During War""","2082","""During times of war, the development of aero engines plays a critical and fascinating role in military advancements. Aero engines are the powerhouse of aircraft, driving propellers or turbines to provide the thrust needed for flight. The evolution of aero engine technology during wars has been a testament to human ingenuity and innovation under pressure. From the early days of World War I to the modern conflicts of today, the constant push for more powerful, efficient, and reliable aero engines has been a driving force behind military aviation. Let's delve into the intricate world of aero engine development during war, examining key advancements, challenges, and impacts on warfare.  The significance of aero engines in war cannot be overstated. In World War I, aircraft were initially used for reconnaissance, but quickly evolved into offensive weapons with the advent of machine guns mounted on planes. This shift in aerial warfare highlighted the need for more powerful engines to increase speed, maneuverability, and payload capacity. The development of aero engines during this period saw a rapid progression from simple air-cooled rotary engines to more complex inline and radial engines that provided greater horsepower and reliability.  One of the most iconic aero engines of World War I was the Liberty L-12, a 27-liter V-12 engine developed in the United States. The Liberty engine played a crucial role in powering Allied aircraft and showcased the importance of standardized engine design for mass production. This standardization enabled easier maintenance and spare parts interchangeability, key factors in sustaining air operations during the war.  The interwar period saw further innovations in aero engine technology, with the rise of air-cooled radial engines like the Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp. Radial engines offered improved cooling and power-to-weight ratios compared to inline engines, making them popular choices for World War II aircraft. The war ignited a fierce competition among engine manufacturers to develop ever-more powerful and reliable engines to meet the demands of modern combat aircraft.  World War II marked a turning point in aero engine development, with advancements in supercharging, fuel injection, and materials contributing to significant performance gains. The development of jet engines, pioneered by the Germans with the Messerschmitt Me 262, introduced a new era of high-speed aerial warfare. Jet engines provided unmatched speed and altitude capabilities, revolutionizing air combat tactics and strategy.  The Allied response to German jet technology led to the development of the British Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, which powered iconic aircraft like the Spitfire and Mustang. The Merlin engine's reliability, performance, and adaptability made it a staple of Allied air forces and a symbol of British engineering prowess. The war also saw the emergence of turboprop engines, blending the efficiency of propellers with the power of turbines to create versatile engines for transport and reconnaissance aircraft.  The Cold War era brought about further advancements in aero engine technology, with the focus shifting towards supersonic flight and stealth capabilities. The development of afterburners, variable geometry intakes, and composite materials pushed aero engines to new frontiers of performance and efficiency. The need for engines that could withstand the rigors of high-speed flight and operate in diverse environments drove continuous innovation in materials science and propulsion systems.  The Vietnam War saw the introduction of advanced turbofan engines like the Pratt & Whitney TF30, powering aircraft like the F-111 and F-14. Turbofan engines offered improved fuel efficiency and lower noise levels, enhancing the combat capabilities of modern fighter jets. The war also saw the rise of aerial refueling, extending the range and endurance of aircraft powered by aero engines.  The Gulf War of the early 1990s showcased the effectiveness of precision-guided munitions and stealth technology, driving demand for engines that could support these advanced capabilities. The General Electric F404 engine, used in aircraft like the F/A-18 Hornet, demonstrated the importance of reliability and maintainability in modern aero engines. The Gulf War accelerated the development of advanced materials like composites and ceramics, enhancing engine performance and durability in harsh combat environments.  In more recent conflicts like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, aero engines have continued to evolve to meet the demands of modern warfare. The development of high-thrust engines like the Pratt & Whitney F135 for the F-35 Lightning II highlights the emphasis on multi-role capabilities and interoperability in contemporary military aviation. Advances in digital engine control systems and integrated health monitoring have improved engine reliability and maintenance, reducing downtime and increasing mission readiness.  Looking ahead, the future of aero engine development during war is poised for further innovation and integration of emerging technologies. Electric propulsion, hypersonic engines, and unmanned aerial systems are shaping the next generation of combat aircraft engines. The quest for increased efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced performance will drive continued research and development in aero engine technology, ensuring air superiority in future conflicts.  In conclusion, aero engine development during war has been a relentless pursuit of excellence and superiority in military aviation. From the rudimentary engines of World War I to the cutting-edge propulsion systems of today, aero engines have transformed the nature of aerial warfare and shaped the course of history. The legacy of innovators, engineers, and aviators who pushed the boundaries of technology in times of conflict stands as a testament to human resolve and determination in the face of adversity. As we look to the horizon of military aviation, the evolution of aero engines will continue to drive progress and shape the future of warfare in the skies.""","1095"
"Gee George E  George Edward ","""We have said that previous to the year 815/8 all was dark and obscure with the precious metal worker, but from that period the work gradually rose in artistic excellence, and the trade very slowly improved; the cause of this no doubt being due, in a great measure, to the security afforded as the result of peace, and with it a revival of the industrial occupations. With the increased industries of the nation arose the pleasures and pastimes of the people, and racing became a national sport. This kind of pleasure soon led to an increase in the work of the silversmith, in consequence of the demand for racing cups, which gave opportunities for the artistic excellence of design in their manufacture; and the silversmiths who made them soon acquired a prestige as Art-manufacturers. The demand for work of that and a similar kind led to the employment of regular designers and modellers, who gradually improved both the designs and the work in different parts of the country. At the period of which we are speaking, polished or burnished silver goods were most in demand, the modern processes of surface finishing not being then understood. The introduction of the French style of work in filigree soon afterwards caused a demand for that class of work; and the attention of those in the trade was then turned in that direction for a time, and others springing up, the silversmith's and goldsmith's trade generally began to assume a position of importance. This kind of work required no polishing and very little artificial finish; besides being exceedingly light in weight and graceful in appearance. It required fine material for its manufacture. In England filigree work has been superseded by other processes, but in India, and in other parts of the East, it is still cultivated to perfection. Silver and gold filigree is also manufactured in the Ionian Islands, in Switzerland, and in some parts of Germany and France, where labour is cheap. In the two latter countries it is made from a very inferior material to that used in India. Silver filigree work in this country was soon found not to answer all the requirements of modern society, so far as regarded its utility, durability, and cheapness; fashion therefore demanded something different. It is worthy of remark that while this class of jewellery in both gold and silver was so much in vogue for ladies' wear, the old-fashioned seals and keys had undergone a change, and the chasing of them in representation of filigree ornamentation had become the fashion for gentlemen's wear. The processes of the manufacture of filigree wire and its mode of application to the work of the artist, have been considered in a previous chapter, further detailed information is therefore rendered unnecessary. When filigree work was no longer used, the fashion changed into 'stamped' or 'struck-up' ornament. Small pieces of metal were struck-up by means of the hammer and punch, or by the use of the hand-press or stamp; in the former case a lead cake would be prepared, composed of a mixture of lead and tin, and upon it the various ornaments would be produced from the flat metal, corresponding with the pattern of the punch employed for the purpose; in the latter a small be employed with the pattern sunk upon it; this would have an aperture through it, the dimensions of the off-side being generally rather large, gradually becoming smaller towards the front surface, which takes the form, in general outline, of the desired pattern. When the necessary blanks have been cut out, another die and punch are used, by which they are raised to their proper shape. These tools should be firmly secured in the press (Fig. 5/8), otherwise they are likely to be soon destroyed. The small ornaments thus raised were variously arranged one upon another, until a design or pattern was formed, which in every way appeared very showy. Such articles suited the tastes of the people at that time, and still suits those who require good weight for their money. The same kind of thing existed at that period in chains, and being heavy-looking, and costly in appearance, they attracted attention and caused a demand. Thus with the continual changing of the fashions a new era for the goldsmiths and silversmiths of England began. They were beginning to work in all sorts of qualities, with the manipulations and finish of which they were becoming now thoroughly conversant, and a demand springing up for goods for purposes of exportation, encouragement was given to the trade, which soon assumed the position of a thriving industry. The style of work that followed the 'struck-up' patterns was that of plain and solid silver-work, well polished and whitened. This sprung up about the period when coloured gold became the fashion, and the mode of finishing it being somewhat similar, no doubt the demand arose as much from the introduction of colouring as from any other assignable cause. In the chain-maker's branch of the art, a great variety of new patterns came into existence at this period; chain bracelets also began to be introduced; and altogether the trade made rapid strides, and fast rose into a great commercial industry. This kind of work has remained more or less in fashion up to the present time, and vast quantities of silver chains of the plain and solid patterns are now being made in Birmingham. The silver trade seems to be an exception to the general depression which now prevails in all the other branches of the jewellery trade; the fashion just now is for silver, which causes a greater demand than is usual for goods manufactured of that material. In a short time we believe this fashion will undergo a change, and then no doubt manufacturers who have taken advantage of it to make large stocks will have goods remaining upon their hands which they will not be able readily to dispose of, unless at a sacrifice; for it should be borne in mind, that to keep a large stock of silver goods in a saleable condition, and without a quick sale, considerable expense is entailed above the cost of making, to keep them in that condition, through their great liability to become tarnished. After the introduction of plain and solid-looking work, it next became the fashion to have it chased over its entire surface. Following this, about the year 825/8, came the beautiful process of enamelling, which added artistic beauty to the work, and brought out the harmonies of colour. About this time, too, there sprung up a great demand for the so-called 'galvanic ring,' which consisted of a lining of zinc and one of silver. The ring represented, in appearance, those large, plain, half-round rings which are now made in 8-carat gold, and which weigh from to 0 dwts. each. It was then as now made of half-round shape, and sometimes with the addition of a buckle upon it. The silver was so drawn upon the zinc that the outer surface appeared entirely of silver, and a portion of the inner surface was made to show the zinc only, which was quite sufficient for the purpose required. When the ring was put on the finger the zinc, in conjunction with the silver, touched the flesh of the wearer, and was thus supposed to create a galvanic action, which it was alleged had a tendency to remove or prevent rheumatism. This kind of work had a good run at the time of its introduction, but like all the rest, the fashion lasted only for a while, when something else had to be brought to the front in the silver trade. The mode of the preparation of the wire was as follows:--A bar of silver would be rolled out until a certain thinness was attained, occasionally annealing it during the process; it was then cut into strips wide enough for the purpose required, again annealed, and subsequently doomed. The latter process was effected in this manner:--A block of hard wood, such as boxwood, would be made use of, having a round groove in one side of it, the metal to be doomed would be laid along the groove and a round piece of iron or steel held upon the upper surface with the left hand; a wooden mallet is then taken with the right hand, and by a skilful application of it to the piece of iron or steel, the metal is soon forced down in the groove and made to take the proper form for drawing. The flat strip of metal should be pointed; this may either be done before or after the dooming process, though it commonly takes place before. It is performed by taking away a small portion in a conical form, from one of the ends with a pair of hand-shears. A piece of zinc wire should be provided, corresponding in shape with that the ring is to take; this is placed in the hollow of the silver to be drawn, with the flat side outwards, so as to correspond with the aperture in the plate through which it has to be drawn. A draw-plate is then taken, with holes of the half-round shape, and the two metals carefully drawn through them. The drawing through a succession of holes produces an edge upon the silver coming against the flat side of the aperture in the draw-plate which overlaps the zinc and thus holds it securely in its place. A change in the style of work gradually took place in the course of every few years, and thus it was that hollow-work became the fashion. This kind could be made in a variety of ways, and being very light and showy, it appeared much more expensive than it really was. It is therefore very easy to account for the changes which have taken place in the manufacture of articles of adornment and luxury, and for the encouragement which the art has received.""","""Historical evolution of silver craftsmanship""","1968","""Silver has been cherished for millennia, both for its monetary value and its beauty. The craft of silverwork dates back to ancient civilizations, where artisans honed their skills to create intricate and ornate pieces that reflected their cultural and artistic sensibilities. From simple tools and decorative objects to elaborate jewelry and ceremonial items, silver craftsmanship has evolved over time, influenced by technology, design trends, and social customs.  In ancient Mesopotamia, silver was among the first metals to be mined and worked by skilled craftsmen. Sumerians and Assyrians crafted silver jewelry, vessels, and religious objects with intricate designs and symbolic motifs. These early works set the stage for the artistic expression and technical proficiency that would characterize silverwork in the centuries to come.  The ancient Egyptians also held silver in high esteem, using it for jewelry, amulets, and religious artifacts. Silver pieces were often adorned with precious gemstones and intricate engravings, showcasing the Egyptians' mastery of metalworking techniques. Silver was associated with the moon and had symbolic significance in their religious beliefs.  During the Greek and Roman periods, silver craftsmanship reached new heights of sophistication and artistry. Greek silversmiths excelled in creating delicate filigree work, intricate patterns, and realistic representations of animals and figures in their silverware. Roman silversmiths further refined these techniques, producing luxurious tableware, drinking vessels, and decorative items that demonstrated their skill and creativity.  In the Middle Ages, silverwork flourished in Europe as guilds of silversmiths were established, ensuring quality craftsmanship and setting standards for the trade. The Renaissance period saw a revival of interest in classical art and design, inspiring silversmiths to create intricate pieces featuring elaborate ornamentation, sculptural elements, and allegorical themes.  During the Baroque and Rococo periods, silverwork became increasingly ornate and decorative, with elaborate patterns, motifs, and embellishments adorning tea sets, candelabras, and other household items. Silver became a status symbol among the aristocracy and nobility, with elaborate silver pieces showcasing wealth and social standing.  The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on silver craftsmanship, introducing mechanized production methods that streamlined the manufacturing process but also led to a decline in handmade silverware. Mass-produced silver items became more accessible to the middle class, while traditional craftsmanship faced challenges from changing tastes and economic pressures.  In the modern era, silver craftsmanship has seen a revival of interest in traditional techniques and artisanal skills. Contemporary silversmiths combine traditional methods with innovative designs, creating unique and stylish pieces that blend the past with the present. Silver continues to be prized for its timeless elegance and versatility, whether in classic designs or avant-garde creations that push the boundaries of the craft.  Today, silver craftsmanship stands as a testament to human creativity, skill, and ingenuity, reflecting our cultural heritage and artistic expression. From ancient civilizations to modern artisans, the evolution of silverwork continues to captivate and inspire, showcasing the enduring beauty and craftsmanship of this precious metal.""","608"
"Pliny the Elder 24 79","""CHAP.. OF THE ON. In what way, then, can land be most profitably cultivated? Why, in the words of our agricultural oracles, by making good out of bad. But here it is only right that we should say a word in justification of our forefathers, who in their precepts on this subject had nothing else in view but the benefit of mankind: for when they use the term bad here, they only mean to say that which costs the smallest amount of money. The principal object with them was in all cases to cut down expenses to the lowest possible sum; and it was in this spirit that they made the enactments which pronounced it criminal for a person who had enjoyed a triumph, to be in possession, among his other furniture, of ten pounds weight of silver plate: which permitted a man, upon the death of his farm-steward, to abandon all his victories, and return to the cultivation of his lands such being the men the culture of whose farms the state used to take upon itself; and thus, while they led our armies, did the senate act as their steward. It was in the same spirit, too, that those oracles of ours have given utterance to these other precepts, to the effect that he is a bad agriculturist who has to buy what his farm might have supplied him with; that the man is a bad manager who does in the day-time what he might have done in the night, except, indeed, when the state of the weather does not allow it; that he is a worse manager still, who does on a work-day what he might have done on a feast-day; but that he is the very worst of all, who works under cover in fine weather, instead of labouring in the fields. I cannot refrain from taking the present opportunity of quoting one illustration afforded us by ancient times, from which it will be found that it was the usage in those days to bring before the people even questions connected with the various methods employed in agriculture, and will be seen in what way men were accustomed to speak out in their own defence. C. Furius Chresimus, a freedman, having found himself able, from a very small piece of land, to raise far more abundant harvests than his neighbours could from the largest farms, became the object of very considerable jealousy among them, and was accordingly accused of enticing away the crops of others by the practice of sorcery. Upon this, a day was named by Spurius Calvinus, the curule dile, for his appearance. Apprehensive of being condemned, when the question came to be put to the vote among the tribes, he had all his implements of husbandry brought into the Forum, together with his farm servants, robust, well-conditioned, and well-clad people, Piso says. The iron tools were of first-rate quality, the mattocks were stout and strong, the plough-shares ponderous and substantial, and the oxen sleek and in prime condition. When all this had been done, Here, Roman citizens, said he, are my implements of magic; but it is impossible for me to exhibit to your view, or to bring into this Forum, those midnight toils of mine, those early watchings, those sweats, and those fatigues. Upon this, by the unanimous voice of the people, he was immediately acquitted. Agriculture, in fact, depends upon the expenditure of labour and exertion; and hence it is that the ancients were in the habit of saying, that it is the eye of the master that does more towards fertilizing a field than anything else. We shall give the rest of these precepts in their appropriate places, according as we find them adapted to each variety of cultivation; but in the meantime we must not omit some of a general nature, which here recur to our recollection, and more particularly that maxim of Cato, as profitable as it is humane: Always act in such a way as to secure the love of your neighbours. He then proceeds to state his reasons for giving this advice, but it appears to me that no one surely can entertain the slightest doubt upon the subject. One of the very first recommendations that he gives is to take every care that the farm servants are kept in good condition. It is a maxim universally agreed upon in agriculture, that nothing must be done too late; and again, that everything must be done at its proper season; while there is a third precept, which reminds us that opportunities lost can never be regained. The malediction uttered by Cato against rotten ground has been treated of at some length already; but there is another precept which he is never tired of repeating, Whatever can be done by the help of the ass, will cost the least money. Fern will be sure to die at the end of a couple of years, if you prevent it from putting forth leaves; the most efficient method of ensuring this is to beat the branches with a stick while they are in bud; for then the juices that drop from it will kill the roots. It is said, too, that fern will not spring up again if it is pulled up by the roots about the turn of the summer solstice, or if the stalks are cut with the edge of a reed, or if it is turned up with a plough-share with a reed placed upon it. In the same way, too, we are told that reeds may be effectually ploughed up, if care is taken to place a stalk of fern upon the share. A field infested with rushes should be turned up with the spade, or, if the locality is stony, with a two-pronged mattock: overgrown shrubs are best removed by fire. Where ground is too moist, it is an advantageous plan to cut trenches in it and so drain it; where the soil is cretaceous, these trenches should he left open; and where it is loose, they should be strengthened with a hedge to prevent them from falling in. When these drains are made on a declivity, they should have a layer of gutter tiles at the bottom, or else house tiles with the face upwards: in some cases, too, they should be covered with earth, and made to run into others of a larger size and wider; the bottom, also, should, if possible, have a coating of stones or of gravel. The openings, too, should be strengthened with two stones placed on either side, and another laid upon the top. Democritus has described a method of rooting up a forest, by first macerating the flower of the lupine for one day in the juice of hemlock, and then watering the roots of the trees with it. CHAP.. (.) THE OF. As the field is now prepared, we shall proceed to speak of the nature of the various kinds of grain; we must premise, however, that there are two principal classes of grain, the cereals, comprising wheat and barley, and the legumina, such as the bean and the chick-pea, for instance. The difference between these two classes is too well known to require any further description. CHAP. 0. THE OF THE OF. The cereals are divided again into the same number of varieties, according to the time of the year at which they are sown. The winter grains are those which are put in the ground about the setting of the Vergili, and there receive their nutriment throughout the winter, for instance, wheat, spelt, and barley. The summer grains are those which are sown in summer, before the rising of the Vergili, such as millet, panic, sesame, horminum, and irio, in accordance, however, with the usage of Italy only; for in Greece and Asia all the grains are sown just after the setting of the Vergili. There are some, again, that are sown at either season in Italy, and others at a third period, or, in other words, in the spring. Some authors give the name of spring-grain to millet, panic, lentils, chick-peas, and alica, while they call wheat, barley, beans, turnips, and rape, sementive or early sowing seeds. Certain species of wheat are only sown to make fodder for cattle, and are known by the name of farrago, or mixed grain; the same, too, with the leguminous plants, the vetch, for instance. The lupine, however, is grown in common as food for both cattle and men. All the leguminous plants, with the exception of the bean, have a single root, hard and tough, like wood, and destitute of numerous ramifications; the chick-pea has the deepest root of all. Corn has numerous fibrous roots, but no ramifications. Barley makes its appearance above ground the seventh day after sowing; the leguminous plants on the fourth, or at the very latest, the seventh; the bean from the fifteenth day to the twentieth: though in Egypt the leguminous plants appear as early as the third day after they are sown. In barley, one extremity of the grain throws out the root, and the other the blade; this last flowers, too, before the other grain. In the cereals in general it is the thicker end of the seed that throws out the root, the thinner end the blossom; while in the other seeds both root and blossom issue from the same part. During the winter, corn is in the blade; but in the spring winter corn throws out a tall stem. As for millet and panic, they grow with a jointed and grooved stalk, while sesame has a stem resembling that of fennel-giant. The fruit of all these seeds is either contained in an ear, as in wheat and barley, for instance, and protected from the attacks of birds and small animals by a prickly beard bristling like so many palisades; or else it is enclosed in pods, as in the leguminous plants, or in capsules, as in sesame and the poppy. Millet and panic can only be said to belong to the grower and the small birds in common, as they have nothing but a thin membrane to cover them, without the slightest protection. Panic receives that name from the panicule or down that is to be seen upon it; the head of it droops languidly, and the stalk tapers gradually in thickness, being of almost the toughness and consistency of wood: the head is loaded with grain closely packed, there being a tuft upon the top, nearly a foot in length. In millet the husks which embrace the grain bend downward with a wavy tuft upon the edge.""","""Agricultural practices and management techniques""","2217","""Agricultural practices and management techniques play a critical role in ensuring food security, sustainable land use, and environmental conservation globally. Farmers and agricultural professionals employ a variety of strategies to maximize crop yields, minimize environmental impact, and adapt to changing climatic conditions. From traditional methods to modern technologies, agricultural practices have evolved over time to meet the growing demands of an expanding population while safeguarding natural resources and biodiversity.  One of the fundamental agricultural practices is crop rotation, a technique where different crops are planted in a sequence on the same field. This method helps improve soil fertility, control pests and diseases, and reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers. By rotating crops such as legumes, grains, and vegetables, farmers can break pest cycles, enhance nutrient availability, and promote overall soil health. Furthermore, diverse crop rotations contribute to biodiversity conservation and resilience in the face of climate change.  Another key aspect of agricultural management is soil conservation. Soil is a finite and valuable resource that requires careful management to sustain agricultural productivity. Techniques such as minimal tillage, cover cropping, and contour plowing help prevent soil erosion, retain moisture, and enhance soil structure. By adopting conservation practices, farmers can maintain soil health, preserve organic matter, and reduce nutrient runoff into water bodies, thus promoting sustainable agriculture.  Integrated pest management (IPM) is an essential strategy in modern agriculture to control pests and diseases effectively while minimizing the use of chemical pesticides. IPM combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical control methods to manage pest populations in a targeted and sustainable manner. By monitoring pest levels, promoting natural enemies, and implementing cultural practices like crop diversification, farmers can reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides and protect beneficial insects, pollinators, and the environment.  Water management is another critical component of agricultural practices, particularly in regions facing water scarcity or drought conditions. Sustainable water use techniques such as drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, and precision agriculture help optimize water resources and improve crop water efficiency. By applying water-saving technologies and practices, farmers can conserve water, increase crop yields, and mitigate the impacts of climate variability on agriculture.  Moreover, agroforestry is a practice that integrates trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes to provide multiple benefits such as soil conservation, biodiversity enhancement, and carbon sequestration. Agroforestry systems help improve soil fertility, offer shade for crops, and diversify farm income through the sale of timber, fruits, and other forest products. By combining agricultural and forestry practices, farmers can achieve ecological resilience, economic sustainability, and climate change adaptation.  Livestock management is an integral part of many agricultural systems, and sustainable livestock practices are essential for both food production and environmental stewardship. Rotational grazing, fodder management, and animal waste recycling are key techniques employed to ensure responsible livestock farming. By implementing proper grazing rotations, providing balanced diets, and managing manure effectively, farmers can enhance animal health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve soil fertility on pasture lands.  In addition to on-farm practices, agricultural management encompasses broader strategies such as market diversification, value chain development, and agribusiness innovation. Farmers can improve their income and resilience by accessing new markets, adding value to their products through processing or branding, and adopting technological solutions for farm management. By linking producers to consumers through efficient supply chains and market networks, agricultural management can create economic opportunities and sustainable livelihoods for farming communities.  Overall, agricultural practices and management techniques are vital for achieving food security, environmental sustainability, and rural development worldwide. By incorporating diverse approaches such as crop rotation, soil conservation, integrated pest management, water efficiency, agroforestry, livestock sustainability, and market-oriented strategies, farmers can enhance productivity, resilience, and profitability in a changing agricultural landscape. Through continuous innovation, knowledge sharing, and policy support, agricultural management will continue to evolve to meet the challenges of the future and ensure a sustainable food system for generations to come.""","781"
"Moore G E  George Edward ","""My references are to the 3th edition, 897. It will be observed that Mill adds absence of pain to pleasure in his first statement, though not in his second. There is, in this, a confusion, with which, however, we need not deal. I shall talk of pleasure alone, for the sake of conciseness; but all my arguments will apply a fortiori to absence of pain: it is easy to make the necessary substitutions. Mill holds, then, that happiness is desirable, and the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only desirable as means to that end (p. 2). Happiness he has already defined as pleasure, and the absence of pain (p. 0); he does not pretend that this is more than an arbitrary verbal definition; and, as such, I have not a word to say against it. His principle, then, is pleasure is the only thing desirable, if I may be allowed, when I say pleasure, to include in that of pain. And now what are his reasons for holding that principle to be true? He has already told Questions of ultimate ends are not amenable to direct proof. Whatever can be proved to be good, must be so by being shewn to be a means to something admitted to be good without proof. With this, I perfectly agree: indeed the chief object of my first chapter was to shew that this is so. Anything which is good as an end must be admitted to be good without proof. We are agreed so far. Mill even uses the same examples which I used in my second chapter. How, he says, is it possible to prove that health is good? What proof is it possible to give that pleasure is good? Well, in Chapter IV, in which he deals with the proof of his Utilitarian principle, Mill repeats the above statement in these words: It has already, he says, been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term (p. 2). Questions about ends, he goes on in this same passage, are, in other words, questions what things are desirable. I am quoting these repetitions, because they make it plain what otherwise might have been doubted, that Mill is using the words desirable or desirable as an end as absolutely and precisely equivalent to the words good as an end. We are, then, now to hear, what reasons he advances for this doctrine that pleasure alone is good as an end. My italics. =0.= Questions about ends, he the rule of action may be confounded with the motive of it is untrue: for the motive of action will then be according to him ipso facto its rule; there can be no distinction between the two, and therefore no confusion, and thus he has contradicted himself flatly. These are specimens of the contradictions, which, as I have tried to shew, must always follow from the use of the naturalistic fallacy; and I hope I need now say no more about the matter. =1.= Well, then, the first step by which Mill has attempted to establish his Hedonism is simply fallacious. He has attempted to establish the identity of the good with the desired, by confusing the proper sense of desirable, in which it denotes that which it is good to desire, with the sense which it would bear, if it were analogous to such words as visible. If desirable is to be identical with good, then it must bear one sense; and if it is to be identical with desired, then it must bear quite another sense. And yet to Mills contention that the desired is necessarily good, it is quite essential that these two senses of desirable should be the same. If he holds they are the same, then he has contradicted himself elsewhere; if he holds they are not the same, then the first step in his proof of Hedonism is absolutely worthless. But now we must deal with the second step. Having proved, as he thinks, that the good means the desired, Mill recognises that, if he is further to maintain that pleasure alone is good, he must prove that pleasure alone is really desired. This doctrine that pleasure alone is the object of all our desires is the doctrine which Prof. Sidgwick has called Psychological Hedonism: and it is a doctrine which most eminent psychologists are now agreed in rejecting. But it is a necessary step in the proof of any such Naturalistic Hedonism as Mills; and it is so commonly held, by people not expert either in psychology or in philosophy, that I wish to treat it at some length. It will be seen that Mill does not hold it in this bare form. He admits that other things than pleasure are desired; and this admission is at once a contradiction of his Hedonism. One of the shifts by which he seeks to evade this contradiction we shall afterwards consider. But some may think that no such shifts are needed: they may say of Mill, what Callicles says of Polus in the Gorgias, that he has made this fatal admission through a most unworthy fear of appearing paradoxical; that they, on the other hand, will have the courage of their convictions, and will not be ashamed to go to any lengths of paradox, in defence of what they hold to be the truth. 81 C-87 B. =2.= Well, then, we are supposing it held that pleasure is the object of all desire, that it is the universal end of all human activity. Now I suppose it will not be denied that people are commonly said to desire other things: for instance, we usually talk of desiring food and drink, of desiring money, approbation, fame. The question, then, must be of what is meant by desire, and by the object of desire. There is obviously asserted some sort of necessary or universal relation between something which is called desire, and another thing which is called pleasure. The question is of what sort this relation is; whether in conjunction with the naturalistic fallacy above mentioned, it will justify Hedonism. Now I am not prepared to deny that there is some universal relation between pleasure and desire; but I hope to shew, that, if there is, it is of such sort as will rather make against than for Hedonism. It is urged that pleasure is always the object of desire, and I am ready to admit that pleasure is always, in part at least, the cause of desire. But this distinction is very important.""","""Hedonism and desire relationships""","1334","""Hedonism is a philosophical concept that centers around the pursuit of pleasure and happiness as the ultimate goals in life. It suggests that pleasure and the avoidance of pain are the primary motivators of human behavior. This school of thought traces its origins back to ancient Greek philosophy, particularly the Cyrenaic school founded by Aristippus. Hedonism can take various forms, ranging from ethical hedonism, which advocates maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain to achieve the highest good, to psychological hedonism, which posits that humans are inherently motivated by the pursuit of pleasure. In contemporary society, hedonism often carries a more self-indulgent connotation, emphasizing immediate gratification and sensory pleasures.  Desire plays a pivotal role in hedonism, as it is desire that propels individuals to seek out pleasurable experiences. The relationship between hedonism and desire is complex and multifaceted, as desire can both drive hedonistic pursuits and be shaped by hedonistic experiences. Desire acts as a catalyst for seeking pleasure, whether it be through sensory experiences, such as enjoying good food or engaging in physical intimacy, or through intellectual pursuits, such as seeking knowledge or engaging in creative endeavors. Hedonism celebrates the fulfillment of desires as a means to achieve happiness and contentment.  One of the key debates within hedonism revolves around the nature of desire and whether all desires are inherently good or if some may lead to negative consequences. Ethical hedonism argues that maximizing pleasure is the ultimate ethical goal, and thus all desires that lead to pleasure are inherently good. However, critics point out that not all desires are conducive to long-term well-being and that prioritizing immediate gratification can lead to harm. For example, the pursuit of excessive material wealth or addictive behaviors may provide short-term pleasure but can ultimately result in negative consequences.  The relationship between hedonism and desire also raises questions about the sustainability of pleasure-seeking behaviors. Hedonism often focuses on maximizing pleasure in the present moment, which can lead to a constant quest for new experiences and sensations. This perpetual pursuit of pleasure may lead individuals to constantly seek out new desires to fulfill, creating a cycle of never-ending consumption without achieving lasting satisfaction. Additionally, hedonism's emphasis on immediate gratification can sometimes neglect the importance of long-term well-being and fulfillment, as true happiness often involves a balance of pleasure and meaningful experiences.  Another aspect of the relationship between hedonism and desire is the role of self-awareness and introspection. Understanding one's desires and motivations is essential in navigating the pursuit of pleasure in a mindful way. By being conscious of the sources of our desires and the potential consequences of our actions, individuals can make more informed choices that align with their values and long-term goals. This self-awareness can help individuals differentiate between fleeting pleasures and deeper sources of fulfillment, leading to a more sustainable approach to hedonistic pursuits.  It is worth noting that hedonism is not inherently incompatible with other philosophical traditions or ethical frameworks. While some may view hedonism as hedonistic or self-indulgent, it is possible to integrate hedonistic principles with a broader ethical outlook that considers the well-being of others and the greater good. By recognizing the interconnectedness of human experiences and the impact of our actions on others, individuals can practice hedonism in a way that promotes not only personal happiness but also the welfare of society as a whole.  In conclusion, the relationship between hedonism and desire is a complex interplay of seeking pleasure, understanding one's motivations, and balancing immediate gratification with long-term well-being. Hedonism offers a lens through which individuals can explore the pursuit of happiness and pleasure, but it also raises important considerations about the nature of desire, ethical decision-making, and the sustainability of pleasure-seeking behaviors. By approaching hedonism with self-awareness, mindfulness, and a consideration for the broader implications of our actions, individuals can navigate the complexities of desire relationships in a way that enhances their overall well-being and fulfillment.""","811"
"Howard Delton Thomas 1883 ","""Dewey reverses this view in a curious manner. It is 'experience' that is built up by the action of thought, not knowledge itself. This play on terms might be innocuous, if it were not accompanied by his separation of the knowing function from others. Dewey makes 'knowing' the servant of 'direct experience' by giving it the function of reconstructing the habits of the organism, in order that unreflective experience may be maintained with a minimum of effort. The non-reflective experience becomes the valuable experience, and knowledge is made to minister unto it. This is truly a 'transvaluation of values.' Dewey asks: 'What is it that makes us live alternately in a concrete world of experience in which thought as such finds not satisfaction, and in a world of ordered thought which is yet only abstract and ideal?' This sharp separation of thought from action is vigorously maintained. Following are some of the terms by means of which the difference between direct and reflective experience is expressed: 'direct practice,' 'derived theory;' 'primary construction,' 'secondary criticism;' 'living appreciation,' 'abstract description;' 'active endeavor,' 'pale reflection.' This casual, easy distinction escapes criticism because it seems harmless and unimportant. The distinction, however, is not real. It does not correspond to the simple facts of life. Thinking, far from being 'pale reflection,' is often a strenuous and energetic 'activity.' Reflection, not 'direct experience,' is often, at least, at the high moment of life. Experience becomes unmeaning on any other basis. 'Living appreciation' and 'primary construction' involve thought in a high degree; 'pale reflection' is lazy contemplation, lacking the spark of life that characterizes true thought. There is no escape from Dewey's needlessly alarming conclusions, except by maintaining that thought accompanies all conscious life, in greater or less degree, and that the moment of real, earnest thinking is at the high tide of life, when all the powers are awake and operating. Thought must be made integral with all other activities, a feature of the total life organization, rather than an isolated phenomenon. Man is a thinking organism, not an organism with a thinker. It is not to be supposed for a moment that by 'thought' is here meant the activity of a merely subjective knower. Dewey does, indeed, deal effectively with the subjective ego, and with representative perceptionism. But by 'thought' is here meant reflection, judgment, inference; and in this sense thought is said to be present in all experience. There can be no question of the relation of thought, so understood, to reality; for the reason that it has been so integrated with experience as to be inseparable from it. Setting aside knowing as the awareness of a conscious subject, there remains an issue with Dewey concerning the actual place of thought, as an empirical process, in experience, and the issue must be settled on definite and really empirical grounds. So much, then, for 'functionalism' and its psychology. Something should be said, before closing this discussion, concerning philosophical methods in general, since Dewey's psychological approach to the problems of philosophy must be held responsible for his anti-intellectualistic results, with their sceptical implications. In the beginning of his career, as has been seen, Dewey adopted the 'psychological method,' and he has adhered to it consistently ever since. This initial attitude, although he was not aware of it for many years, cut him off from the community of understanding that exists among modern idealists concerning the proper aims and purposes of philosophical inquiry. Although at first a professed follower of Green and Caird, Dewey's method was not reconcilable with idealistic procedure, and in a very real sense he never was an idealist. The virulence of his later attacks on 'intellectualism' may be explained in terms of his reaction against a philosophical method which interfered with the development of his own 'naturalistic' tendencies. The method of idealism, or speculative philosophy, is logical; but it may perfectly well be empirical at the same time. To the anti-intellectualist empirical logic is an anomaly, a red blue-bird, so to speak. The philosophical logician is represented as one who evolves reality out of his own consciousness; who labors with the concepts which have their abode in the mental sphere, and, by means of the principle of contradiction, forces them into harmony until they provide a perfectly consistent representation of the external world which, because of its perfect rationality, must somehow correspond with the cosmic reality. In spite of the fact that no man possesses, at least in a sane condition, the mental equipment requisite for such a performance, certain critics have not hesitated to impute this kind of logical procedure to the idealists. To quote from Dewey himself: 'For modern philosophy is, as every college senior recites, epistemology; and epistemology, as perhaps our books and lectures sometimes forget to tell the senior, has absorbed Stoic dogma. Passionless imperturbability, absolute detachment, complete subjection to a ready-made and finished reality. is its professed ideal. Philosophy has dreamed the dream of a knowledge which is other than the propitious outgrowth of beliefs that shall develop aforetime their ulterior implications in order to recast them., the dream of a knowledge that has to do with objects having no nature save to be known.' This charge against modern idealism has little foundation. Speculative philosophy repudiated, long ago, the 'epistemological standpoint' as defined by Dewey. Idealists have not fostered the conception of a knowing subject shut in to its own states, seeking information about an impersonal reality over against itself. Note, for example, this comment of Pringle-Pattison on Kant, made over thirty-five years ago: 'The distinction between mind and the world, which is valid only from a certain point of view, he took as an absolute separation. He took it, to use a current phrase, abstractly--that is to say, as a mere fact, a fact standing by itself and true in any reference. And of course when two things are completely separate, they can only be brought together by a bond which is mechanical, external, and accidental to the real nature of both.' Dewey himself never condemned 'epistemology' more effectively. But it is useless to cite instances, for any serious student familiar with the literature of modern philosophy ought to know that 'idealism' has never really been 'epistemological' in the sense meant by Dewey and his disciples. Subjectivism is not idealism,--the stolid dogmatism of neo-realism to the contrary notwithstanding. Idealism holds, speaking more positively, that philosophers must submit the conceptions and methods which they employ to a preliminary immanent criticism, in order to determine the limits within which they may be validly applied. Every genuine category or method is valid within a certain sphere of relevance, and the business of criticism is to determine by empirical investigation or by 'ideal experiment' (which means much the same thing) what concrete significance the conception is capable of bearing. Dewey, from the standpoint of idealism, is guilty of a somewhat uncritical use of the categories of 'description' and 'evolution.' Are the categories of biology fitted to explain mind and spirit? Instead of instituting an inquiry designed to answer that question, Dewey accepts 'evolutionism' as final, and attempts to force all phenomena into conformity with his resulting logical scheme. He misses the valuable checks upon thought which are furnished by the 'critical method,' and is none too sensitive to the technical results of the special sciences. The logical approach to philosophy strictly involves certain implications which have been overlooked by many of its critics. It may well be admitted that our real categories are not fixed and final, but are perpetually in process of reconstruction. The process of criticism inevitably makes manifest the human and empirical character of the particular forms of reflective thought. It recognizes the fact of development, both in knowledge and in reality, and by this very recognition the value of knowledge is enhanced. It is forced, by the very nature of its method, to recognize the concrete and practical bearings of thought. Indeed, there is a sense in which idealism would declare that there is no thought--when thought, that is, is taken to mean an isolated fact out of relation to the world. It is not possible to make this retort upon the critics of idealism without recognizing that there has been a vast misjudgment, amounting almost to misrepresentation, of the intellectual ideals of modern speculative philosophy. To conclude, it is neither by abstract logical processes, nor yet by the dogmatic employment of scientific categories, that philosophy makes progress, but by an empirical process which unites criticism and experiment. In speaking of the development of modern idealism, Bosanquet says: 'All difficulties about the general possibility--the possibility in principle--of apprehending reality in knowledge and preception were flung aside as antiquated lumber. What was undertaken was the direct adventure of knowing; of shaping a view of the universe which should include and express reality in its completeness. The test and criterion were not any speculative assumption of any kind whatever. They were the direct work of the function of knowledge in exhibiting what could and what could not maintain itself when all the facts were confronted and set in the order they themselves demanded. The method of inquiry was ideal experiment.'""","""Dewey's philosophy of experience and thought""","1939","""Dewey's philosophy of experience and thought, encapsulated in his pragmatist approach to understanding the nature of human knowledge and reality, represents a profound and influential perspective that continues to resonate in contemporary philosophical discourse. John Dewey, a prominent figure in American philosophy and educational theory during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, sought to bridge the gap between theory and practice, emphasizing the interconnectedness of experience, thought, and action. Through his work, Dewey laid the groundwork for a holistic view of knowledge acquisition that integrates personal experience, reflective thinking, and social engagement.  At the core of Dewey's philosophy is the concept of experience as a crucial component in the process of cognition and meaning-making. For Dewey, experience is not a static or isolated event but a dynamic and continuous interaction between an individual and their environment. He argued that all human knowledge is rooted in experience, which serves as the foundation for understanding the world and for shaping our beliefs and values. Dewey rejected the traditional dualism between mind and body, proposing instead a more unified approach that treats experience as a seamless whole encompassing both cognitive and embodied aspects of human existence.  Dewey further developed his philosophy by exploring the intricate relationship between experience and thought. According to Dewey, thought emerges from our ongoing experiences and is a tool for problem-solving, adaptation, and growth. Thought, for Dewey, is not a purely intellectual exercise but an active process of inquiry and experimentation that is deeply embedded in our lived experiences. Dewey's notion of """"thinking in action"""" emphasizes the practical and experimental aspects of cognition, highlighting the importance of testing ideas in real-world contexts and learning from the outcomes.  Central to Dewey's philosophy is the idea that thought should be grounded in the rich tapestry of human experience. He believed that knowledge is not a product of detached contemplation or abstract reasoning but a result of active engagement with the world. Dewey advocated for a form of education that encourages students to learn by doing, to connect theoretical concepts with real-world applications, and to participate in collaborative problem-solving activities. For Dewey, thinking is inseparable from doing, and true learning occurs when individuals are actively involved in meaningful experiences that challenge and expand their understanding of the world.  Dewey's pragmatic approach to experience and thought has wide-ranging implications for various fields, including education, psychology, and social theory. His emphasis on the importance of experiential learning, critical reflection, and democratic participation has inspired educational reform efforts aimed at fostering creativity, empathy, and social responsibility in students. Dewey's emphasis on the interconnectedness of experience and thought has also had a lasting impact on cognitive psychology, influencing research on perception, problem-solving, and decision-making processes.  In conclusion, Dewey's philosophy of experience and thought offers a compelling vision of knowledge acquisition as a dynamic and interactive process that is deeply embedded in the fabric of human existence. By emphasizing the inseparability of experience and thought, Dewey challenges us to reexamine our assumptions about the nature of knowledge and to embrace a more integrated and participatory mode of learning and inquiry. Dewey's ideas continue to inspire scholars, educators, and practitioners to explore new ways of engaging with the world and to cultivate a deeper appreciation for the transformative power of experiential learning and reflective thinking.""","668"
"Grew Edwin Sharpe","""That this uplift has been going on by small and sudden movements, from a foot to ten feet at each shock, for more than two centuries is attested by good evidence. The coast in many places is proven to be from twenty to thirty feet higher to-day than it was in the middle of the seventeenth century. Sir Charles Lyell, in his Principles of Geology, gives a most interesting account of the sudden upheaval of a portion of a mountain range, with the accompaniment of a great earthquake, near Wellington, in New Zealand, in January, 85/85/8. Both the North and South Islands of that colony have been affected by upliftings during the nineteenth century, and these movements have been attended by powerful and far-reaching earthquakes. The changes wrought by these movements on the shores and farther inland as well have been remarkable during the last hundred years. Another example of the same kind of activity is seen in the occasional rise of islands from the sea; but to this we shall refer again, and for the present we may return to the Calabrian earthquake, which presented many curious and many characteristic features. During the earthquake the surface of the country heaved in great undulations, which were productive of a feeling of sea-sickness, and which, according to some observers, made the clouds appear to stand still, as they will sometimes seem to do from the deck of a tossing ship. The fissures which appeared in the ground were numbered by thousands, and sometimes the displacements of the earth amounted to as much as ten feet. Houses were lifted high up; in other places the land or the sea-floor sank several feet. Many of the fissures opened, spurted out sand or water, and then closed again; and some of the Calabrian plains after the earthquake were found to be dotted with circular hollows, on the average about the size of carriage wheels, which were like wells, but were sometimes filled with sand instead of water. These were afterwards found to be =V=-shaped. In addition to these hundreds of small cone-shaped hollows or wells there were other water basins more deserving the name of ponds or lakes. One of these in the neighbourhood of Seminara, to which the name of Lago di Tolfilo was given, was about a third of a mile in length, and was so copiously fed by the springs ranged in a fissure in its bottom that all attempts to drain it proved useless. Near Sitizam a valley was completely choked up by the landslip from opposite sides, and behind this new dam a lake was formed which was about two miles in length and one mile in breadth. Vivenzio states that fifty lakes arose at the time of the earthquake, and the Government surveyors, who included ponds, counted no fewer than 15/8. The first effect of the more violent shocks was generally to dry up the rivers. Immediately afterwards many of their beds were so blocked up over them that the rivers overflowed. From the rock of Scylla opposite to Charybdis, in the Straits of Messina, large sections of cliff were broken off, in one instance for a whole mile's length of coast. The sea and the neighbourhood was greatly disturbed; and soon after the fall of the cliffs of Scylla the sea rose to a height of twenty feet, and the wave rolling over the coast-line drowned 5/800 people. Japan is perhaps as unstable an area as anywhere exists on the earth, and the records of its earthquakes are more complete than in any other country. The number of destructive earthquakes recorded there in the last fifteen hundred years is 23. Since the beginning of the seventeenth century the records are fairly perfect, and it is found that since then a destructive earthquake has occurred somewhere in the Japanese islands nearly every two and a half years. For the lighter shocks systematic observation has become necessary, and the Japanese, with that development of the scientific spirit which is so remarkable an accompaniment of their progress during the last generation, have organised an Earthquake Recording Service--a Seismological Bureau--at which such conspicuous meteorologists as Mr. John Milne and Dr. Knott have worked, and which has produced great seismologists among the Japanese themselves. As many of our readers are aware, the earth is hardly ever still; it trembles continually like a boiling kettle, though not for the same reasons; and the delicate instruments for measuring earthquakes, which are called seismometers, show continual earth tremors or earth shivers. Since 888 the earthquakes of all intensities recorded in Japan give a yearly average of 447 shocks, or a daily average of four. Until the great earthquake of 891, the greatest shocks within the memory of living men were those of 85/84-. The earthquake of October 8th, 891, shook an area of 43,00 square miles, or more than three-fifths of the entire area of Japan, though the greatest damage was done on the Mino-Owari Plain, a broad expanse of country occupied by rice fields and surrounded by mountains. Without the least warning the blow came, and in the first shock 0,00 buildings fell, 000 people were killed and 7,00 were injured. Innumerable fissures great and small appeared all over the plain, and the houses in the thickly packed villages fell like packs of cards. The plain is one of Japan's great gardens, and supported almost 000 people to the square mile. Villages were thereabout continuous, and a narrow lane of unusual destruction could be traced through them for twenty miles. After the first shock there were numerous smaller ones, and during the next five months no fewer than 5/86 shocks were recorded in all. Among the more remarkable effects of the earthquake was the actual shifting of the country. Along a crack many miles in length the plain after the earthquake was some feet lower on one side than on the other. Reservoirs and swamps were formed, as well as sand pits and mud craters. The most conspicuous effect, however, from a geological standpoint was the shifting and distortion of the strata. A few years later, on the 6th and 7th August, 896, occurred the remarkable Icelandic earthquake, which affected a triangular plateau, bordered by high mountains, including Mount Hecla and other well-known volcanoes, in the south-western portion of the island. During the shocks the earth's surface was thrown into waves, so that neither man nor cattle could stand. Persons who were lying on the ground near a cliff were by the shock thrown bodily over the edge. A high hill in the plain is described as shaken 'like a dog coming out of the water,' and a thick mantle of loose soil which had covered it was afterwards found distributed in heaps about its base. The surface of the plain was scarred by open fissures or by rock walls which had been caused by the earth's rising on one side of a fissure. One of the fissures was nine miles and another seven miles in length. The mountains round the plains were riven by clefts, and many landslips occurred. As we have mentioned elsewhere, a new geyser was formed, throwing up water to an enormous height, but soon spending its early force; and many geysers and springs were violently disturbed. An earthquake of a very different kind occurred the next year in the province of Assam, India (June 2th, 897). Unlike the Icelandic earthquake, almost the whole damage was here the result of the first shock. Everything was destroyed within the first fifteen seconds of the earthquake, and the heavy shocks had all passed before two and a half minutes had elapsed. In this brief space of time an area of,5/80,00 square miles had been shaken and 5/80,00 square miles laid in ruins. A member of the Geological Survey of India, who was in the town of Shillong, says that a rumbling sound like near thunder preceded the shocks by a second or so and increased in loudness, so that when masonry began to fall the noise and rattle of the falling stones were hardly to be perceived. Unable to stand on his feet, this observer sat down on the ground, and not only felt but saw the ground thrown into violent waves as if 'composed of soft jelly.' These waves seemed to run along the ground. When the shocks had passed all the masonry houses in Shillong had been levelled to the ground, and over each hung a cloud of pink plaster particles and dust. Some of the shocks seem to have occurred with a kind of twist, and stone monuments were given the appearance of corkscrews. There were left many fissures and depressions in the ground, and the rivers and lakes and streams were greatly affected. Thirty new lakes were formed; along the great Brahmaputra River rolled a great wave ten feet high. One great rent in the geological strata at the earth's surface was twelve miles long. Important changes of level of great blocks of country were clearly shown by the alterations in the aspect of the landscape. Ranges of hills which before had not been visible from certain points now came into view for the first time, while others had disappeared. Though the most destructive shock was that felt during the first few seconds, there were others which followed, lasting for nearly a week afterwards. This earthquake is of special interest, because it was the first one which was registered on the earthquake instruments set up in Europe.""","""Earthquake impacts and geological changes""","1947","""Earthquakes are natural phenomena that can have profound impacts on the environment, communities, and geological features of the affected areas. These seismic events occur when there is a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, leading to the shaking of the ground. The effects of earthquakes can vary depending on factors such as magnitude, depth, distance from the epicenter, and local geology. In this article, we will explore the impacts of earthquakes on both human civilization and the Earth's geological landscape.  One of the most immediate and devastating effects of an earthquake is structural damage to buildings and infrastructure. The violent shaking can cause buildings to collapse, roads to crack, and bridges to fail, leading to loss of life and widespread destruction. In urban areas with high population density and inadequate construction standards, the impact of earthquakes can be particularly severe. The 1994 Northridge earthquake in California, for example, caused extensive damage to buildings and highways, highlighting the vulnerability of modern infrastructure to seismic events.  In addition to physical damage, earthquakes can also trigger secondary hazards such as landslides, tsunamis, and liquefaction. Landslides can be triggered by the shaking of the ground, especially in mountainous regions with steep slopes. These mass movements of rock and soil can bury communities and block roads, exacerbating the impact of the earthquake. Tsunamis, which are large ocean waves generated by undersea earthquakes, can inundate coastal areas with devastating consequences. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, triggered by a massive undersea earthquake, resulted in widespread destruction and loss of life in countries bordering the Indian Ocean.  Moreover, liquefaction is another significant hazard associated with earthquakes. It occurs when saturated soil loses its strength due to the shaking, causing it to behave like a liquid. This phenomenon can lead to the sinking of buildings, tilting of infrastructure, and disruption of underground utilities. The 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand caused extensive liquefaction in the affected areas, causing significant damage to residential neighborhoods and public infrastructure.  Beyond the immediate impacts on human settlements, earthquakes can also result in long-term geological changes. The movement of tectonic plates along fault lines during an earthquake can create new landforms, alter landscapes, and reshape the Earth's crust. For example, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake caused a significant displacement along the San Andreas Fault, leading to changes in the topography of the region. Over geologic time scales, repeated seismic activity can contribute to the formation of mountain ranges, rift valleys, and other geological features.  Furthermore, earthquakes play a crucial role in the process of mountain building and the evolution of the Earth's crust. The collision of tectonic plates can lead to the uplift of mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas, through the process of orogeny. Earthquakes associated with this tectonic activity not only shape the Earth's surface but also influence the distribution of minerals, the formation of geologic faults, and the movement of groundwater. Studying the geological effects of earthquakes can provide valuable insights into the dynamic processes that shape our planet.  In conclusion, earthquakes have far-reaching impacts on both human societies and the Earth's geological landscape. From the immediate devastation caused by structural damage and secondary hazards to the long-term geological changes that shape the Earth's surface, seismic events are a powerful force of nature. Understanding and mitigating the impact of earthquakes require a multidisciplinary approach that combines geology, engineering, and emergency preparedness. By studying the geological effects of earthquakes, we can learn more about the dynamic processes that have shaped our planet for millions of years.""","726"
"Hartley C Gasquoine Catherine Gasquoine ","""Her position was unchanged by marriage, for her rights were safeguarded by her kindred, whose own interests could be protected only through her freedom. If we turn next to the status of men--of the husband and father--in the maternal kindred group, we find their power and influence at first gradually, and then rapidly, decreasing. It was under these conditions of family communism that the rights of the husband and father were restricted on every side. Not only does he not stand out as a principal person from the background of the familial clan; he has not even any recognised social existence in the family group. This restriction of the husband and father was clearly dependent on the form of marriage. We have seen that the individual relationships between the sexes began with the reception of temporary lovers by the woman in her own home. But a relationship thus formed would tend under favourable circumstances to be continued, and, in some cases, perpetuated. The lover became the husband; he left the home of his mother to reside with his wife among her kin; he was still without property or any recognised rights in her clan, with no--or very little--control over the woman and none over her children, occupying, indeed, the position of a more or less permanent guest in her hut or tent. The wife's position and that of her children was assured, and in the case of a separation it was the man who departed, leaving her in possession. Under such an organisation the family and social customs were in most cases--and always, I believe, in their complete maternal form--favourable to women. Kinship was reckoned through the mother, since in this way alone could the undivided family be maintained. The continuity of the clan thus depending on the women, they were placed in a very special position of importance, the mother was at least the nominal head of the household, shaping the destiny of the clan through the aid of her clan-kindred. Her closest male relation was not her husband, but her brother and her son; she was the conduit by which property passed to and from them. Often women established their own claims and all property was held by them; which under favourable circumstances developed into what may literally be called a matriarchate. In all cases the child's position was dependent entirely on the mother and not on the father. Such a system of inheritance may be briefly summarised as 'mother-right.' There is another matter to notice. Every possible experiment in sexual association has been tried, and is still practised among various barbarous races, with very little reference to those moral ideas to which we are accustomed. It is, however, very necessary to remember that monogamy is frequent and indeed usual under the maternal system. We have seen many examples where, with complete freedom of separation held by the wife, lasting and most happy marriages are the rule. When the husband lives with his wife in a dependent position to her family he can do so only in the case of one woman. For this reason polygamy is much less deeply rooted under the conditions in which the communal life is developed than in patriarchal communities. In the complete maternal family it is never common, and is even prohibited. It is significant that in Sumatra polygamy occurs with the djudur marriages, where the wife is bought and lives with her husband, while it is unknown in the maternal marriages. It is frequent in Africa and elsewhere, when the marriage is not the maternal form. As we might expect, the case is quite opposite with polyandry. This form of marriage has evident advantages for women when compared with polygamy; it is also a form that requires a certain degree of social civilisation. It clearly involves the limitation of the individual marital rights of the husband. Polyandry in the joint family group was not due to a licentious view of marriage; far otherwise, it was an expression of the communism which is characteristic of this organisation. This fact has been forgotten by many writers, who have regarded this form of the sexual relationships as a very primitive development, connected with group-marriage and promiscuous ownership of women. It is very necessary to be clear on this point. Under the maternal conditions, nothing is more certain than the equality of women with men in all questions of sexual morality. In proof of this it is necessary only to recall the facts we have noted. We find little or no importance attached to virginity, which in itself indicates the absence of any conception of the woman as property. Thus no bride-price is claimed from the husband, who renders service in proof of his fitness as a lover, not to gain possession of the bride. The girl is frequently the wooer, and, in certain cases, she or her mother imposes the conditions of the marriage. After marriage the free provision for perhaps of even greater significance. There can, I think, be no doubt that this freedom in love was dependent on the wife's position of security under the maternal form of marriage. I hold that the facts brought forward entitle us to claim that the maternal communal clan was an organisation in which there was a freer community of interest, far more fellowship in labour and partnership in property, with a resulting liberty for woman, than we find in any patriarchal society. For this reason, shall we, then, look back to this maternal stage as to a golden period, wherein was realised a free social organisation, carrying with it privileges for women, which even to-day among ourselves have never been established, and only of late claimed? It is a question very difficult to answer, and we must not in any haste rush into mistakes. We found that the mother-age was a transitional stage in the history of the evolution of society, and we have indicated the stages of its gradual decline. It is thus proved to have been a less stable social system than the patriarchate which again succeeded it, or it would not have perished in the struggle with it. Must we conclude from this that the one form of the family is higher than the other--that the superior advantage rests with the patriarchal system? Not at all: rather it proves how difficult is the struggle to socialise. Human nature tends so readily towards individualism; it yields itself up to the joy of possession whenever it is possible. The impulse to dominate by virtue of strength or property possession has manifested itself in every age. It cannot be a matter of surprise, therefore, that at this period of social development a rebellion arose against the customs of maternal communism. Within the large and undivided family of the clan the restricted family became gradually re-established by a reassertion of individual interests. In proportion as the family gained in interest of the individual members would become separated from the group to which they belonged. Each one would endeavour to get himself as large a share as possible of what was formerly held in common. As society advanced property would increase in value, and the social and political significance of its possession would also increase. Afterwards, when personal property was acquired, each man would aim at gaining a more exclusive right over his wife and children; he would not willingly submit to the bondage of the maternal form of marriage. In the earlier days the clan spirit was too strong, now men had shaken off, to a degree sufficient for their purpose, the female yoke, which bound the clan together. We have seen the husband and father moving towards the position of a fully acknowledged legal parent by a system of buying off his wife and her children from their clan-group. The movement arose in the first instance through a property value being connected with women themselves. As soon as the women's kindred found in their women the possibility of gaining worldly goods for themselves, they began to claim service and presents from their lovers. It was in this way for economic reasons, and for no moral considerations that the maternal marriage fell into disfavour. The payment of a bride-price was claimed, and an act of purchase was accounted essential. As we have seen, it was regarded as a condition, not so much of the marriage itself, but of the transference of the wife to the home of the husband and of the children to his kindred. The change was, of course, effected slowly; and often we find the two forms of marriage--the maternal and the purchase-marriage--occurring side by side. What, however, is certain is that the purchase-marriage in the struggle was the one that prevailed. This reversal in the form of the marriage brought about a corresponding reversal in the status of women. This is so plain. The women of the family do not now inherit property, but are themselves property, passing from the hands of their father to that of a husband. As purchased wives they are compelled to reside in the husband's house and among his kin, who have no rights or duties in regard to them, and where they are strangers. In a word, the wife occupies the same position of disadvantage as the man had done in the maternal marriage. And her children kept her bound to this alien home in a much closer way than the husband could ever have been bound to her home. The protection of her own kindred was the source of the woman's power and strength. This was now lost. The change was not brought about without a struggle, and for long the old customs contended with the new. But as the patriarchate developed, and men began to gain individual possession of their children by the purchase of their mothers, the father became the dominant power in the family. Little by little individual interests prevailed.""","""Maternal vs. Patriarchal Family Systems""","1926","""The structure and dynamics of family systems have played a significant role in shaping human societies throughout history. Two primary types of family systems, maternal and patriarchal, have been prevalent across different cultures and eras, each carrying unique characteristics and implications for individuals within them. Understanding the distinctions between these two systems sheds light on the gender roles, power dynamics, and social norms that have influenced family life.  Maternal family systems, also known as matrilineal or matrilocal systems, have women at the center of familial authority and lineage. In these societies, descent is traced through the female line, and women often hold primary decision-making power within the family unit. Maternal families often prioritize cooperation, interconnectedness, and nurturing relationships. Women are typically seen as the primary caregivers and are revered for their role in sustaining the family's well-being.  One of the key features of maternal family systems is the emphasis on extended kinship networks. In matrilineal societies, relatives through the mother's side hold significant importance, contributing to a sense of community and support. This extended family structure can foster strong bonds and collective responsibilities, with individuals cooperating and sharing resources for the common good.  Moreover, in maternal family systems, inheritance and property rights are often passed down through the female line. This practice ensures economic stability for women and their descendants, challenging the traditional notion of male inheritance prevalent in patriarchal systems. By entrusting women with assets and property ownership, maternal family systems promote economic empowerment and autonomy for women, allowing them greater financial security and control over their lives.  In contrast, patriarchal family systems are characterized by male dominance and authority within the familial hierarchy. In these systems, descent is traced through the male line, and men hold primary decision-making power and inherit property and assets. Patriarchal societies often place a strong emphasis on individualism, competition, and hierarchy, with men expected to fulfill traditional gender roles as providers and protectors.  Patriarchal family systems tend to prioritize nuclear family structures, with a focus on the immediate family unit consisting of parents and children. This nuclear family arrangement can sometimes lead to more isolated and independent relationships compared to the interconnectedness seen in maternal family systems. Additionally, the emphasis on male lineage and inheritance in patriarchal systems can perpetuate gender disparities and limit women's access to resources and opportunities.  Gender roles in patriarchal family systems are often rigidly defined, with women expected to fulfill domestic duties and caregiving roles while men are tasked with providing for the family financially. This division of labor can create unequal power dynamics within the household, leading to issues of gender inequality and limited autonomy for women. Patriarchal norms and expectations can also influence societal attitudes towards gender roles and relationships outside the family unit, perpetuating gender stereotypes and reinforcing traditional gender norms.  Both maternal and patriarchal family systems have evolved over time, influenced by various social, cultural, and economic factors. While matrilineal societies may offer women greater autonomy and communal support, patriarchal systems have often been associated with male privilege and gender inequality. It is important to recognize that these family systems are not fixed or universal; they exist on a spectrum, with nuances and variations within different cultures and communities.  In contemporary societies, there is increasing awareness of the need to challenge traditional family structures and promote gender equality within familial relationships. Efforts to dismantle patriarchal norms and empower women in decision-making processes are vital for creating more equitable family systems. By recognizing the strengths of maternal family systems in promoting cooperation and interconnectedness and striving towards more inclusive and egalitarian family structures, we can work towards building healthier and more resilient communities for future generations.""","726"
"Bill Ledyard","""There are many fine churches erected, whose capacity, though large, is not much greater than seems demanded by the church-going inhabitants, which affords both a commentary and index to their general high character. Among the public buildings worthy of special attention is that of their Normal school, recently finished at a cost of over one hundred thousand dollars, being a model of elegance and convenience. This is a State institution, free to pupils of a certain class, and is one of three--all of the same character--erected under the patronage of the State, and for the location of which towns were invited to compete. Winona secured this, Mankato another, and St. Cloud the third, all noble buildings, as we can personally testify, and which give to the people of this State opportunities such as those of the older commonwealths were utterly destitute, and are still, so far as scope, scale, and affluence are concerned. Then there is the city school, costing over half a hundred thousand dollars, and likewise highly ornamental, as well as useful. New England long boasted of her superiority in the rank of her schools; especially was this the case in Connecticut, where a school fund existed, reducing somewhat the expense attending their maintenance; but they used no part of this fund toward the building of school-houses, and it is a question if it has not had there an opposite effect of what originally it was intended to accomplish. The same old shabby school-houses, fifteen by twenty, still do duty, and the district committee annually figure with the many youthful candidates for teachers--who, it used to be said, came there on a horse--to make the per-head allowance of the school fund, with boarding around thrown in, pay for their three months' services. Had the people understood they must hand out the whole school expenses, and seen personally to the education of their children, they would have had a livelier interest in the whole business; and this, with compelled liberality, would have paved the way for greater expenditure and effort. Neighborhood rivalries of suitable buildings would have followed, and, instead of incompetent teachers being the rule, they would have been the exception, and those of us whose fortune it has been to be born in New England would not now be such 'jacks of all trades and masters of none' as we are. The West deserves great commendation for their lively interest in all that relates to the education of the young. Why, almost any of these States excel those of New England in school matters, outside of two or three of the great universities which they happen to possess. Several years ago, in passing through Indiana and visiting several of the village schools, we were surprised and astonished at the superior class of text-books that were in use, and the improved methods of teaching in practice; and, likewise, the prompt and intelligent manner of the scholar in his exercises and examples, as compared with similar schools at the East; all a proof of the superior methods and facilities in vogue. The new States have had it in their power to do what most of the older ones had not, and after all they cannot claim all the credit of their advancement in these matters, for the general government shares part of the honor in this wise provision for the education of the people, having donated one section of land in every township in some of the newer States. This was the case in Minnesota. These lands are to be used in establishing a school fund, and this has already amounted to a large sum--two million five hundred thousand dollars; and these normal school buildings are an evidence alike of the wisdom of the measure and magnitude of this fund. The site of the town--while ample for a large city, having an area of several miles in extent--seems rather too low to insure that dryness essential to good health, though we believe its general sanitary reputation is as good as any of the towns along the river, and this is more than could be expected, since its general elevation scarce exceeds a dozen feet above the river when at a fair stage of water. Its levee accommodations are extensive and excellent, and the place must always remain the most important in southern Minnesota. Passing several minor towns and landings, along the river, we next come to, a village of about fifteen hundred inhabitants, with the prettiest location of any that we have yet seen. It stands on an elevated table, about forty feet above the river, and invites the tourist and invalid, by its pleasant quietness, to tarry and inspect the place. The hospitable-looking hotel, with its ample lawn and grounds close by the banks of the river, give promise of abundant rest and recreation. The grain interest is the all-absorbing one at this point, as it is everywhere along the river. A short distance above, and REED'S appears. This town is at the foot of Lake Pepin, and likewise at the foot of a huge bluff. This place becomes in spring the terminus of the steamers which are prevented from proceeding farther in consequence of the heavier ice of the lake remaining an obstruction to commerce for a period of ten days or two weeks longer than that in the river proper. LAKE is nearly thirty miles in length, with an average width of about three miles, presenting an unbroken sheet of water; bounded on both its sides by tall perpendicular bluffs, with here and there isolated peaks towering far above their companions, having something of the dignity of mountain ranges. This lake is famed for its great attractions of natural beauty, and is not disappointing to the traveller. It is a singular body of water, and while it is a part of the river still it differs from it in so many aspects that it is fairly entitled to be termed a lake. Below, the river is divided into numerous and devious channels by intervening islands of an irregular and picturesque character, uniting to give a grand, kaleidoscopic variety to the journey; but here, at Lake Pepin, the waters have free scope, and rise and swell under the pressure of storms sufficient to move and sway the heaviest fleets. The water is remarkably clear and cold, and is said to be over a thousand feet in depth at some points. It is a tradition among the Indians that the bed of the river, with its islands, sank during a great storm, in which the earth trembled and shook for many leagues around. This seems quite possible, and the general formation of the lake indicates that their tradition is founded on actual fact. The chief point of interest attaching to this locality is that known as the Maiden's Rock, a perpendicular cliff midway of the lake on the eastern shore. Were there no legend connected with it, the eye would be arrested by its lofty and impressive form, as it stands alone frowning on the dark, deep waters of the lake below. Chief Wapashaw, whose village once occupied the site of the present city of Winona, had a daughter, Weenonah, the beauty and pride of all his tribe. This fair maiden had been thwarted in her affections by powerful and cruel hands, and rather than submit to unite her young life with one, other than he whom she so fondly loved, resolved to sacrifice herself. A fishing party, of which she was a member, proceeded to this lake, and while resting on the eastern shore she fled away, and to the top of this high eminence, where, discovering herself to the company below, she recited the story of her broken heart and undying love for him whose name she had been even forbade to speak, and, closing by chanting a wild death-song, flung herself down the sides of this terrible precipice, and was dashed in pieces. Her father and friends, guessing her intent, on being hailed by her from the top of this rock, dispatched, as the story goes, their fleetest of foot to her rescue, but unavailingly. No Indian passes by this place of tragedy without uttering mournful wails in memory of their beautiful and loved Weenonah. Along the base of these cliffs are numerous caverns, once the abode of wild beasts, and, even as late as Carver's visit, in 766, numbers of bears were found wintering in them, and in the minor caves numberless rattlesnakes were seen by him. In his explorations in this immediate neighborhood he discovered, on the edge of the prairie, the outlines of an old fortification, which was distinctly traceable, and extended for nearly a mile, in its sweep enveloping an area ample for five thousand men. Its form was semi-circular, with the flanks resting on the river. The whole appearance was as if it had been built full a century before his visit, and while the ditch was indistinguishable, its angles were, and 'displayed as much of science as if built by a pupil of Vauban himself.' What race could have originally constructed it is a mystery, certainly not any of the known tribes inhabiting this country. Carver could not have misjudged the character of these intrenchments, since he had himself received a military education, and was therefore, of all explorers, not likely to be misled in his estimate. The pleasure seeker will find it convenient to visit any portion of Lake Pepin from any of the villages along its shores. From Lake City a steamer usually plies to all interesting points, up and down the lake. Those wishing to halt in a locality of rare beauty and refined society, will choose above. Half a dozen miles above the north end of the lake comes RED WING, named after one of the great Dakota chiefs. It is attractively situated on the esplanade adjoining the famous Barnes' Bluff, with an amphitheatre of hills in the rear completely sheltering and hedging the place from view as it is approached from the south. The bluff is between four and five hundred feet in height, and on its summit lies buried the remains of the great chief, Red Wing.""","""Education and architecture in Minnesota""","2049","""Education and architecture in Minnesota share a significant role in shaping the state's identity and fostering growth. From historic buildings to modern educational institutions, Minnesota's architectural landscape reflects its commitment to learning and innovation. This essay explores how education and architecture intersect in Minnesota, highlighting key buildings and institutions that have contributed to the state's cultural and intellectual tapestry.  Minnesota's education system is renowned for its quality and accessibility. The state is home to a diverse range of educational institutions, from public schools to prestigious universities. One of the most iconic features of Minnesota's educational landscape is its commitment to architecture that is functional, aesthetically pleasing, and sustainable. The design of educational buildings in Minnesota reflects the state's values of excellence in education and a dedication to creating inspiring spaces for learning.  The University of Minnesota stands out as a pioneer in architectural innovation in the state. The university's Twin Cities campus boasts a mix of historic and modern buildings that showcase a diverse range of architectural styles. One of the most notable buildings on campus is the Weisman Art Museum, designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry. The Weisman Art Museum's distinctive stainless steel facade and unconventional design make it a standout architectural landmark in Minnesota.  In addition to the University of Minnesota, Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) system plays a vital role in providing accessible and affordable education to students across the state. MnSCU campuses are known for their efficient and functional design, emphasizing sustainability and adaptability. Buildings like the Science Education Center at St. Cloud State University and the Integrated Science and Engineering Laboratory Facility at Minnesota State University Mankato demonstrate the state's commitment to cutting-edge architectural design in educational settings.  Apart from higher education institutions, Minnesota's K-12 schools also play a significant role in shaping the state's architectural landscape. Many school districts in Minnesota have embraced innovative design concepts to create inspiring and safe learning environments for students. The Edina Public Schools in the Twin Cities metro area, for example, have invested in modernizing their school buildings to enhance student experiences and promote collaboration and creativity.  The intersection of education and architecture extends beyond formal educational institutions to include public libraries, museums, and cultural centers in Minnesota. The Minneapolis Central Library, designed by Cesar Pelli, is a striking example of architectural excellence in a public setting. The library's modern design features a unique cantilevered structure and expansive windows that create a welcoming and light-filled space for patrons.  Minnesota is also home to a rich architectural heritage, with historic buildings that have stood the test of time and continue to inspire awe and admiration. The State Capitol building in St. Paul, designed by architect Cass Gilbert, is a prime example of Beaux-Arts architecture in Minnesota. The Capitol's grand dome, intricate carvings, and expansive corridors showcase the state's commitment to preserving its architectural legacy.  Furthermore, Minnesota's commitment to sustainable architecture is evident in buildings like the Minneapolis Institute of Art, which has implemented green building practices to reduce its environmental impact. The museum's expansion, designed by Michael Graves, incorporates energy-efficient strategies and sustainable materials to create a harmonious blend of art and architecture.  Beyond individual buildings, urban planning and design play a crucial role in shaping Minnesota's architectural fabric. The city of Minneapolis, for instance, has embraced a vision of a walkable and inclusive urban environment, reflected in projects like the Minneapolis Riverfront Development Initiative and the Midtown Greenway. These initiatives aim to create vibrant public spaces that promote social interaction, physical activity, and connectivity.  Moreover, Minnesota's commitment to accessibility in architecture is commendable, with many public buildings and spaces designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has been instrumental in ensuring that architectural barriers are removed, creating a more inclusive built environment for all Minnesotans.  In conclusion, education and architecture in Minnesota are intricately linked, defining the state's cultural heritage and promoting intellectual growth and innovation. From historic landmarks to cutting-edge educational facilities, Minnesota's architectural landscape is a testament to its commitment to excellence in design and education. By nurturing a vibrant architectural ecosystem that values creativity, sustainability, and inclusivity, Minnesota continues to inspire and empower generations of learners and citizens.""","840"
"Haworth Paul Leland","""This experiment is typical of a great many others and it resulted, of course, in better yields on the manured ground and showed that two bushels of seed were preferable to four. But if he ever set down the result of the experiment as regards the varieties, the passage has escaped me. While at Fredericksburg this year visiting his mother and his sister Betty Lewis he learned of an interesting method of raising potatoes under straw and wrote down the details in his diary. A little later when attending the Federal Convention he kept his eyes and ears open for agricultural information. He learned how the Pennsylvanians cultivated buckwheat and visited the farm of a certain Jones, who was getting good results from the use of plaster of Paris. With his usual interest in labor-saving machinery he inspected at Benjamin Franklin's a sort of ironing machine called a mangle, 'well calculated,' he thought, 'for Table cloths & such articles as have not pleats & irregular foldings & would be very useful in large families.' This year he had in wheat seven hundred acres, in grass five hundred eighty acres, in oats four hundred acres, in corn seven hundred acres, with several hundred more in buckwheat, barley, potatoes, peas, beans and turnips. In 788 he raised one thousand eighty-eight bushels of potatoes on one plantation, but they were not dug till December and in consequence some were badly injured by the frost. An experiment that year was one of transplanting carrots between rows of corn and it was not successful. He worked hard in these years, but, as many another industrious farmer has discovered, he found that he could do little unless nature smiled and fickle nature persisted in frowning. In 785/8 the rain seemed to forget how to fall, and in 786 how to stop falling. Some crops failed or were very short and soon he was so hard up that he was anxious to sell some lands or negroes to meet debts coming due. In February, 786, in sending fifteen guineas to his mother, he wrote: 'I have now demands upon me for more than 00, three hundred and forty odd of which is due for the tax of 786; and I know not where or when I shall receive one shilling with which to pay it. In the last two years I made no crops. In the first I was obliged to buy corn, and this year have none to sell, and my wheat is so bad I can neither eat it myself nor sell it to others, and tobacco I make none. Those who owe me money cannot or will not pay it without suits, and to sue is to do nothing; whilst my expenses, not from any extravagance, or an inclination on my part to live splendidly, but for the absolute support of my family and the visitors who are constantly here, are exceedingly high.' To bad crops were joined bad conditions throughout the country generally. The government of the Confederation was dying of inanition, America was flooded with depreciated currency, both state and Continental. In western Massachusetts a rebellion broke out, the rebels being largely discouraged debtors. A state of chaos seemed imminent and would have resulted had not the Federal Convention, of which Washington was a member, created a new government. Ultimately this government brought order and financial stability, but all this took time and Washington was so financially embarrassed in 789 when he traveled to New York to be inaugurated President that he had to borrow money to pay the expenses of the journey. After having set the wheels of government in motion he made an extended trip through New England and whenever public festivities would permit he examined into New England farm methods and took copious notes. On the first day up from New York he saw good crops of corn mixed with pumpkins and met four droves of beef cattle, 'some of which were very fine--also a Flock of Sheep. We scarcely passed a farm house that did not abd. in Geese.' His judgment of New England stock was that the cattle were 'of a good quality and their hogs large, but rather long legged.' The shingle roofs, stone and brick chimneys, stone fences and cider making all attracted his attention. The fact that wheat in that section produced an average of fifteen bushels per acre and often twenty or twenty-five was duly noted. On the whole he seems to have considered the tour enjoyable and profitable in spite of the fact that on his return through Connecticut the law against Sabbath traveling compelled him to remain over Sunday at Perkins' Tavern and to attend church twice, where he 'heard very lame discourses from a Mr. Pond.' About 785/8 Washington had begun a correspondence with Arthur Young and also began to read his periodical called the Annals of Agriculture. The Annals convinced him more than ever of the superiority of the English system of husbandry and not only gave him the idea for some of the experiments that have been mentioned, but also made him very desirous of adopting a regular and systematic course of cropping in order to conserve his soil. Taking advantage of an offer made by Young, he him English plows, cabbage, turnip, sainfoin, rye-grass and hop clover seed and eight bushels of winter vetches; also some months later, velvet wheat, field beans, spring barley, oats and more sainfoin seed. He furthermore expressed a wish for 'a plan of the most complete and useful farmyard, for farms of about 00 acres. In this I mean to comprehend the barn, and every appurtenance which ought to be annexed to the yard.' Young was as good as his word. Although English law forbade the exportation of some of these things--a fact of which Washington was not aware--he and Sir John Sinclair prevailed upon Lord Grenville to issue a special permit and in due course everything reached Mount Vernon. Part of the seeds were somewhat injured by being put into the hold of the vessel that brought them over, with the result that they overheated--a thing that troubled Washington whenever he imported seeds--but on the whole the consignment was in fair order, and our Farmer was duly grateful. The plows appeared excessively heavy to the Virginians who looked them over, but a trial showed that they worked 'exceedingly well.' To Young's plan for a barn and barnyard Washington made some additions and constructed the barn upon Union Farm, building it of bricks that were made on the estate. He later expressed a belief that it was 'the largest and most convenient one in this country.' It has now disappeared almost utterly, but Young's plan was subsequently engraved in the Annals. In return for the exertions of Young and Sinclair in his behalf Washington sent over some American products and also took pains to collect information for them as to the state of American agriculture. His letters show an almost pathetic eagerness to please these good friends and it is evident that in his farming operations he regarded himself as one of Young's disciples. He was no egotist who believed that because he had been a successful soldier and was now President of the United States he could not learn anything from a specialist. The trait was most commendable and one that is sadly lacking in many of his countrymen, some of whom take pride in declaring that 'these here scientific fellers caint tell me nothin' about raisin' corn!' Young and Sir John Sinclair were by no means his only agricultural correspondents. Even Noah Webster dropped his legal and philological work long enough in 790 to propound a theory so startlingly modern in its viewpoint that it is worthy of reproduction. Said he: 'While therefore I allow, in its full extent, the value of stable manure, marl, plaster of Paris, lime, ashes, sea-weed, sea-shells & salt, in enriching land, I believe none of them are absolutely necessary, but that nature has provided an inexhaustible store of manure, which is equally accessible to the rich and the poor, & which may be collected & applied to land with very little labor and expense. This store is the atmosphere, & the process by which the fertilizing substance may be obtained is vegetation.' He added that such crops as oats, peas, beans and buckwheat should be raised and plowed under to rot and that land should never be left bare. As one peruses the letter he recalls that scientists of to-day tell us that the air is largely made up of nitrogen, that plants are able to 'fix it,' and he half expects to find Webster advocating 'soil innoculation' and speaking of 'nodules' and 'bacteria.' Throughout the period after the Revolution our Farmer's one greatest concern was to conserve and restore his land. When looking for a new manager he once wrote that the man must be, 'above all, Midas like, one who can convert everything he touches into manure, as the first transmutation toward gold; in a word, one who can bring worn-out and gullied lands into good tilth in the shortest time.' He saved manure as if it were already so much gold and hoped with its use and with judicious rotation of crops to accomplish his object. 'Unless some such practice as this prevails,' he wrote in 794, 'my fields will be growing worse and worse every year, until the Crops will not defray the expense of the culture of them.' He drew up elaborate plans for the rotation of crops on his different farms. Not content with one plan, he often drew up several alternatives; calculated the probable financial returns from each, allowing for the cost of seed, cultivation and other expenses, and commented upon the respective advantages from every point of view of the various plans. The labor involved in such work was very great, but Washington was no shirker. He was always up before sunrise, both in winter and summer, and seems to have been so constituted that he was most contented when he had something to do.""","""Agricultural practices and innovations""","2039","""Agricultural practices and innovations play a crucial role in shaping the future of food production and sustainability. With the world's population steadily increasing, estimated to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the need for efficient and sustainable agricultural practices has never been more critical. Farmers and researchers worldwide are continuously exploring new methods and technologies to meet the growing demands for food while minimizing environmental impact. This evolution in agricultural practices is paving the way for a more sustainable and productive future in farming.  One of the key areas of innovation in agriculture is the adoption of precision farming techniques. Precision agriculture involves using technology such as GPS, drones, and sensors to optimize the use of resources like water, fertilizers, and pesticides. By precisely monitoring and managing field variability, farmers can tailor their inputs to specific areas, maximizing yields while reducing waste. This not only boosts productivity but also minimizes environmental impact by decreasing the use of inputs that can harm ecosystems.  Another area of significant advancement in agriculture is the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs are engineered to possess desirable traits such as resistance to pests, diseases, and environmental stress. These traits enable crops to thrive in challenging conditions, increasing resilience and ensuring higher yields. Despite controversies surrounding GMOs, they have the potential to address food security challenges by improving crop productivity and reducing losses.  Furthermore, sustainable agricultural practices focus on conserving natural resources and promoting biodiversity. Conservation tillage, cover cropping, and crop rotation are techniques that help improve soil health, reduce erosion, and enhance water retention. These practices not only benefit the environment but also contribute to long-term agricultural productivity. By maintaining healthy soils and diverse ecosystems, farmers can ensure the sustainability of their operations for future generations.  In recent years, vertical farming has emerged as a promising innovation in agriculture, especially in urban areas with limited arable land. Vertical farming involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers or inclined surfaces, using controlled-environment agriculture technologies like artificial lighting and hydroponic systems. This method allows for year-round production of fresh and locally grown produce, reducing transportation costs and carbon emissions associated with traditional farming practices.  The integration of digital technologies in agriculture, known as AgTech, is revolutionizing the way farmers manage their operations. From precision agriculture tools to farm management software, AgTech solutions streamline processes, collect real-time data, and optimize decision-making. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, farmers can make informed choices that improve productivity, sustainability, and profitability.  Moreover, sustainable agriculture practices extend beyond crop production to livestock farming. Livestock emissions, especially methane from ruminants, contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. To address this issue, researchers are exploring innovative solutions such as feed additives, breeding programs, and manure management strategies to reduce emissions and improve the overall sustainability of livestock production.  In conclusion, agricultural practices and innovations are essential for meeting the global food demand sustainably. By embracing technology, adopting sustainable practices, and prioritizing environmental stewardship, farmers can enhance productivity, conserve resources, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. As we look towards the future, continued investment in agricultural research and innovation will be key to ensuring food security, environmental sustainability, and the well-being of communities worldwide.""","641"
"Hudson W H  William Henry ","""These fowls in summer always lived in small parties, each party composed of one cock and as many hens as he could collect--usually three or four. Each family occupied its own feeding ground, where it would pass a greater portion of each day. The hen would nest at a considerable distance from the feeding ground, sometimes as far as four or five hundred yards away. After laying an egg she would quit the nest, not walking from it as other fowls do, but flying, the flight extending to a distance of from fifteen to about fifty yards; after which, still keeping silence, she would walk or run, until, arrived at the feeding ground, she would begin to cackle. At once the cock, if within hearing, would utter a responsive cackle, whereupon she would run to him and cackle no more. Frequently the cackling call-note would not be uttered more than two or three times, sometimes only once, and in a much lower tone than in fowls of other breeds. If we may assume that these fowls, in their long, semi-independent existence in La Plata, have reverted to the original instincts of the wild Gallus bankiva, we can see here how advantageous the cackling instinct must be in enabling the hen in dense tropical jungles to rejoin the flock after laying an egg. If there are egg-eating animals in the jungle intelligent enough to discover the meaning of such a short, subdued cackling call, they would still be unable to find the nest by going back on the bird's scent, since she flies from the nest in the first place; and the wild bird probably flies further than the creolla hen of La Plata. The clamorous cackling of our fowls would appear then to be nothing more than a perversion of a very useful instinct. VII. THE. It might possibly give the reader some faint conception of the odious character of this I say that, in talking to strangers from abroad, I have never thought it necessary to speak of sunstroke, jaguars, or the assassin's knife, but have never omitted to warn them of the skunk, minutely describing its habits and personal appearance. I knew an Englishman who, on taking a first gallop across the pampas, saw one, and, quickly dismounting, hurled himself bodily on to it to effect its capture. Poor man! he did not know that the little animal is never unwilling to be caught. Men have been blinded for ever by a discharge of the fiery liquid full in their faces. On a mucous membrane it burns like sulphuric acid, say the unfortunates who have had the experience. How does nature protect the skunk itself from the injurious effects of its potent fluid? I have not unfrequently found individuals stone-blind, sometimes moving so briskly about that the blindness must have been of long standing--very possibly in some cases an accidental drop discharged by the animal itself has caused the loss of sight. When coming to close quarters with a skunk, by covering up the face, one's clothes only are ruined. But this is not all one has to fear from an encounter; the worst is that effluvium, after which crushed garlic is lavender, which tortures the olfactory nerves, and appears to pervade the whole system like a pestilent ether, nauseating one until sea-sickness seems almost a pleasant sensation in comparison. To those who know the skunk only from reputation, my words might seem too strong; many, however, who have come to close quarters with the little animal will think them ridiculously weak. And consider what must the feelings be of one who has had the following experience--not an uncommon experience on the pampas. There is to be a dance at a neighbouring house a few miles away; he has been looking forward to it, and, dressing himself with due care, mounts his horse and sets out full of joyous anticipations. It is a dark windy evening, but there is a convenient bridle-path through the dense thicket of giant thistles, and striking it he puts his horse into a swinging gallop. Unhappily the path is already occupied by a skunk, invisible in the darkness, that, in obedience to the promptings of its insane instinct, refuses to get out of it, until the flying hoofs hit it and sand it like a well-kicked football into the thistles. But the forefoot of the horse, up as high as his knees perhaps, have been sprinkled, and the rider, after coming out into the open, dismounts and walks away twenty yards from his animal, and literally smells himself all over, and with a feeling of profound relief pronounces himself Not the minutest drop of the diabolical spray has touched his dancing shoes! Springing into the saddle he proceeds to his journey's end, is warmly welcomed by his host, and speedily forgetting his slight misadventure, mingles with a happy crowd of friends. In a little while people begin exchanging whispers and significant glances; men are seen smiling at nothing in particular; the hostess wears a clouded face; the ladies cough and put their scented handkerchiefs to their noses, and presently they begin to feel faint and retire from the room. Our hero begins to notice that there is something wrong, and presently discovers its cause; he, unhappily, has been the last person in the room to remark that familiar but most abominable odour, rising like a deadly exhalation from the floor, conquering all other odours, and every moment becoming more powerful. A drop has touched his shoe after all; and fearing to be found out, and edging towards the door, he makes his escape, and is speedily riding home again; knowing full well that his sudden and early departure from the scene will be quickly discovered and set down to the right cause. In that not always trustworthy book The Natural History of Chili, Molina tells us how they deal with the animal in the trans-Andine regions. 'When one appears,' he says, 'some of the company begiu by caressing it, until an opportunity offers for one of them to seize it by the tail. In this position the muscles become contracted, the animal is unable to eject its fluid, and is quickly despatched.' One might just as well talk of caressing a cobra de capello; yet this laughable fiction finds believers all over South and North America. Professor Baird gravely introduces it into his great work on the mammalia. I was once talking about animals in a rancho, when a person that, while visiting an Indian encampment, he had asked the savages how they contrived to kill skunks without making even a life in the desert intolerable. A grave old Cacique informed him that the secret was to go boldly up to the animal, take it by the tail, and despatch it; for, he said, when you fear it not at all, then it respects your courage and dies like a lamb--sweetly. The officer, continuing his story, said that on quitting the Indian camp he started a skunk, and, glad of an opportunity to test the truth of what he had heard, dismounted and proceeded to put the Indian plan in practice. Here the story abruptly ended, and when I eagerly demanded to hear the sequel, the amateur hunter of furs lit a cigarette and vacantly watched the ascending smoke. The Indians aro grave jokers, they seldom smile; and this old traditional skunk-joke, which has run the length of a continent, finding its way into many wise books, is their revenge on a superior race. I have shot a great many eagles, and occasionally a carancho (Polyborus tharus), with the plumage smelling strongly of skunk, which shows that these birds, pressed by hunger, often commit the fearful mistake of attacking the animal. My friend Mr. Ernest Gibson, of Buenos Ayres, in a communication to the Ibis, describes an encounter he actually witnessed between a carancho and a skunk. Riding home one afternoon, he spied a skunk 'shuffling along in the erratic manner usual to that odoriferous quadruped;' following it at a very short distance was an eagle-vulture, evidently bent on mischief. Every time the bird came near the bushy tail rose menacingly; then the carancho would fall behind, and, after a few moments' hesitation, follow on again. At length, growing bolder, it sprung forward, seizing the threatening tail with its claw, but immediately after 'began staggering about with dishevelled plumage, tearful eyes, and a profoundly woe-begone expression on its vulture face. The skunk, after turning and regarding its victim with an I-told-you-so look for a few moments, trotted unconcernedly off.' I was told in Patagonia by a man named Molinos, who was frequently employed by the Government as guide to expeditions in the desert, that everywhere throughout that country the skunk is abundant. Some years ago he was sent with two other men to find and treat with an Indian chief whose whereabouts were not known. Far in the interior Molinos was overtaken by a severe winter, his horses died of thirst and fatigue, and during the three bitterest months of the year he kept himself and his followers alive by eating the flesh of skunks, the only wild animal that never failed them. No doubt, on those vast sterile plains where the skunk abounds, and goes about by day and by night careless of enemies, the terrible nature of its defensive weapon is the first lesson experience teaches to every young eagle, fox, wild cat, and puma. Dogs kill skunks when made to do so, but it is not a sport they delight in. One moonlight night, at home, I went out to where the dogs, twelve in number, were sleeping: while I stood there a skunk appeared and deliberately came towards me, passing through the dogs where they lay, and one by one as he passed them they rose up, and, with their tails between their legs, skulked off.""","""Animals and their behaviors""","2106","""Animals, with their diverse behaviors, fascinate us with their unique characteristics and abilities. From the mighty lions of the African savannah to the tiny ants collaborating in intricate colonies, the animal kingdom is a treasure trove of fascinating behaviors that showcase the intricacies of evolution and adaptation.  One of the most fundamental behaviors in the animal kingdom is communication. Animals have developed a wide array of methods to convey information to one another. Vocalizations, such as the haunting calls of howler monkeys or the melodious songs of birds, play a crucial role in establishing territory, attracting mates, and warning of danger. Beyond sounds, animals also communicate through body language, using postures, gestures, and facial expressions to express emotions and intentions. For instance, a dog wagging its tail or a cat purring can signal happiness and contentment. Some animals, like bees, even communicate through dance, with intricate movements guiding fellow hive members to food sources.  Another intriguing behavior is predation. Predators have evolved extraordinary skills to capture their prey, ranging from the stealthy approach of a stalking feline to the lightning-fast strike of a falcon diving for its target. These behaviors are honed through years of evolution, shaped by the predator's environment and hunting strategies. Predators are critical in maintaining ecosystem balance by controlling prey populations and eliminating weak individuals, thereby strengthening the gene pool of the prey species.  On the flip side, prey species have also developed a plethora of defensive strategies to evade predators. Camouflage is a common tactic employed by many animals, allowing them to blend seamlessly into their surroundings and avoid detection. From the stick insects resembling twigs to the snowshoe hares changing their coat color with the seasons, camouflage is a remarkable adaptation that enhances an animal's chances of survival. Other defensive behaviors include startling displays, like the eyespots of butterflies that deter predators by mimicking a larger animal or the deimatic behaviors of some insects that startle predators with sudden movements.  Social behaviors are another captivating aspect of animal life. Many species exhibit complex social structures, from the intricate societies of ants with queens, workers, and soldiers to the familial bonds observed in elephants and dolphins. Social behavior often serves various purposes, such as enhancing protection against predators, increasing foraging efficiency, or facilitating reproduction. In highly social species like wolves and meerkats, cooperation and teamwork are essential for survival, with individuals cooperating to raise young, defend territories, and hunt for food.  Reproduction is a fundamental behavior that drives the continuation of species. The strategies animals employ for reproduction vary widely across the animal kingdom. Some species, like salmon, undergo arduous migrations to reach their spawning grounds, while others engage in elaborate courtship rituals to attract mates. Mating systems, such as monogamy, polygamy, and promiscuity, are shaped by factors like competition for resources, parental care requirements, and mate availability. Parental care also plays a crucial role in ensuring the survival of offspring, with some animals investing significant time and energy in rearing their young, while others exhibit minimal parental involvement.  Migration is a remarkable behavior observed in many animal species, from birds and mammals to fish and insects. Migration involves the seasonal movement of individuals or entire populations between different habitats, often driven by factors like food availability, climate changes, or breeding requirements. The ability to navigate vast distances with precision is a testament to the incredible instincts and adaptations of migratory species. Birds, in particular, are renowned for their long-distance migrations, with some species traveling thousands of miles each year between breeding and wintering grounds.  Territorial behavior is another common phenomenon in the animal kingdom, where individuals defend and mark specific areas as their own. Territories serve various purposes, including securing access to resources like food, mates, and shelter, as well as signaling dominance and deterring rivals. Animals employ a range of tactics to establish and maintain territories, such as vocalizations, scent marking, displays of aggression, and boundary patrolling. Territories can vary widely in size and complexity, from the vast hunting grounds of wolves to the intricate burrow systems of prairie dogs.  Altruism and cooperation are behaviors that challenge traditional notions of survival of the fittest. In certain animal species, individuals exhibit selfless behaviors that benefit others at a cost to themselves. Examples of altruism abound in the animal kingdom, from meerkats standing guard to alert the group of approaching predators to vampire bats regurgitating blood to feed hungry roostmates. Such behaviors can be explained by kin selection, where individuals help relatives to pass on shared genes, or reciprocal altruism, where individuals cooperate with the expectation of future benefits.  Animals' behaviors are shaped by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and social factors. Evolutionary pressures have sculpted a wide range of behaviors that enable animals to navigate their ecosystems, interact with conspecifics, and ensure their survival and reproduction. Studying animal behaviors provides valuable insights into the natural world, offering a glimpse into the strategies and adaptations that have allowed species to thrive and evolve over millions of years.  In conclusion, animals' behaviors are a testament to the remarkable diversity and ingenuity of life on Earth. From the intricate communication patterns of social insects to the awe-inspiring migrations of whales, animal behaviors captivate and inspire us. By delving into the fascinating world of animal behaviors, we gain a deeper appreciation of the complexity and beauty of the natural world that surrounds us.""","1097"
"Richards John 1834 ","""The torsional capacity being based upon the diameter, often leads to the construction of what may be termed diminishing shafts, lines in which the diameter of the several sections are diminished as the distance from the driving power increases, and as the duty to be performed becomes less. This plan of arranging line shafting has been and is yet quite common, but certainly was never arrived at by careful observation. Almost every plan of construction has both advantages and disadvantages, and the best means of determining the excess of either, in any case, is to first arrive at all the conditions as near as possible, then form a 'trial balance,' putting the advantages on one side and the disadvantages on the other, and footing up the sums for comparison. Dealing with this matter of shafts of uniform diameter and shafts of varying diameter in this way, there may be found in favour of the latter plan a little saving of material and a slight reduction of friction as advantages. The saving of material relates only to first cost, because the expense of fitting is greater in constructing shafts when the diameters of the different pieces vary; the friction, considering that the same velocity throughout must be assumed, is scarcely worth estimating. For disadvantages there is, on the other hand, a want of uniformity in fittings that prevents their interchange from one part of a line shaft to the other--a matter of great importance, as such exchanges are frequently required. A line shaft, when constructed with pieces of varying diameter, is special machinery, adapted to some particular place or duty, and not a standard product that can be regularly manufactured as a staple article by machinists, and thus afforded at a low price. Pulleys, wheels, bearings, and couplings have all to be specially prepared; and in case of a change, or the extension of lines of shafting, cause annoyance, and frequently no little expense, which may all be avoided by having shafts of uniform diameter. The bearings, besides being of varied strength and proportions, are generally in such cases placed at irregular intervals, and the lengths of the different sections of the shaft are sometimes varied to suit their diameter. With line shafts of uniform diameter, everything pertaining to the shaft--such as hangers, couplings, pulleys, and bearings--is interchangeable; the pulleys, wheels, bearings, or hangers can be placed at pleasure, or changed from one part of the shaft to another, or from one part of the works to another, as occasion may require. The first cost of a line of shafting of uniform diameter, strong enough for a particular duty, is generally less than that of a shaft consisting of sections varying in size. This may at first seem strange, but a computation of the number of supports required, with the expense of special fitting, will in nearly all cases show a saving. Attention has been called to this case as one wherein the conditions of operation obviously furnish true data to govern the arrangement of machinery, instead of the determinable strains to which the parts are subjected, and as a good example of the importance of studying mechanical conditions from a practical and experimental point of view. If the general diameter of a shaft is based upon the exact amount of power to be transmitted, or if the diameter of a shaft at various parts is based upon the torsional stress that would be sustained at these points, such a shaft would not only fail to meet the conditions of practical use, but would cost more by attempting such an adaptation. The regular working strain to which shafts are subjected is inversely as the speed at which they run. This becomes a strong reason in favour of arranging shafts to run at a maximum speed, provided there was nothing more than first cost to consider; but there are other and more important conditions to be taken into account, principal among which are the required rate of movement where power is taken off to machines, and the endurance of bearings. In the case of line shafting for manufactories, if the speed varies so much from that of the first movers on machines as to require one or more intermediate or countershafts, the expense would be very great; on the contrary, if countershafts can be avoided, there is a great saving of belts, bearings, machinery, and obstruction. The practical limit of speed for line shafts is in a great measure dependent upon the nature of the bearings, a subject that will be treated of in another place. (.) What kind of strains are shafts subjected to?--(.) What determines the strength of shafts in resisting transverse strain?--(.) Why are shafts often more convenient than belts for transmitting power?--(.) What is the difference between the strains to which shafts and belts are subjected?--(.) What is gained by constructing a line shaft of sections diminishing in size from the first mover?--(.) What is gained by constructing line shafts of uniform diameter? XII. FOR. The traction of belts upon pulleys, like that of locomotive wheels upon railways, being incapable of demonstration except by actual experience, for a long time hindered the introduction of belts as a means of transmitting motion and power except in cases when gearing or shafts could not be employed. Motion is named separately, because with many kinds of machinery that are driven at high speed--such as wood machines--the transmission of rapid movement must be considered as well as power, and in ordinary practice it is only by means of belts that such high speeds may be communicated from one shaft to another. The first principle to be pointed out in regard to belts, to distinguish them from shafts as a means of transmitting power, is that power is communicated by means of tensile instead of torsional strain, the power during transmission being represented in the difference of tension between the driving and the slack side of belts. In the case of shafts, their length, or the distance to which they may be extended in transmitting power, is limited by torsional resistance; and as belts are not liable to this condition, we may conclude that unless there are other difficulties to be contended with, belts are more suitable than shafts for transmitting power throughout long distances. Belts suffer resistance from the air and from friction in the bearings of supporting pulleys, which are necessary in long horizontal belts; with these exceptions they are capable of moving at a very high rate of speed, and transmitting power without appreciable loss. Following this proposition into modern engineering examples, we find how practice has gradually conformed to what these properties in belts suggest. Wire and other ropes of small diameter, to avoid air friction, and allowed to droop in low curves to avoid too many supporting pulleys, are now in many cases employed for transmitting power through long distances, as at Schaffhausen, in Germany. This system has been very successfully applied in some cases for distributing power in large manufacturing establishments. Belts, among which are included all flexible bands, do not afford the same facilities for taking off power at different points as shafts, but have advantages in transmitting power to portable machinery, when power is to be taken off at movable points, as in the case of portable travelling cranes, machines, and so on. An interesting example in the use of belts for communicating power to movable machinery is furnished by the travelling cranes of Mr Ramsbottom, in the shops of the L. & N. W. Railway, at Crewe, England, where powerful travelling cranes receive both the lifting and traversing power by means of a cotton rope not more than three-fourths of an inch in diameter, which moves at a high velocity, the motion being reduced by means of tangent wheels and gearing to attain the force required in lifting heavy loads. Observing the operation of this machinery, a person not familiar with the relations between force and motion will be astonished at the effect produced by the small rope which communicates power to the machinery. Considered as means for transmitting power, the contrast as to advantages and disadvantages lies especially between belts and gearing instead of between belts and shafts. It is true in extreme cases, such as that cited at Crewe, or in conveying water-power from inaccessible places, through long distances, the comparison lies between belts and shafts; but in ordinary practice, especially for first movers, the problem as to mechanism for conveying power lies between belts and gear wheels. If experience in the use of belts was thorough, as it is in the case of gearing, and if the quality of belts did not form so important a part in the estimates, there would be but little difficulty in determining where belts should be employed and where gearing would be preferable. Belts are continually taking the place of gearing even in cases where, until quite recently, their use has been considered impracticable; one of the largest rolling mills in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, except a single pair of spur wheels as the last movers at each train of rolls, is driven by belts throughout. Leaving out the matter of a positive relative movement between shafts, which belts as a means of transmitting power cannot insure, there are the following conditions that must be considered in determining whether belts or other means should be employed in transmitting power from one machine to another or between the parts of machines.. The distance to which power is to be transmitted.. The speed at which the transmitting machinery must move.. The course or direction of transmission, whether in straight lines or at angles.. The cost of construction and durability.. The loss of power during transmission.. Danger, noise, vibration, and jar.""","""Shaft Design and Power Transmission""","1912","""Shaft design is a critical aspect of engineering that plays a vital role in power transmission systems. These shafts are mechanical components that transmit torque and rotation between mechanical parts. The design of shafts impacts the efficiency, reliability, and overall performance of various machines, making it essential to understand the principles behind their design and their role in power transmission.  One of the key considerations in shaft design is selecting the appropriate material for the specific application. Materials like steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and titanium are commonly used due to their strength, durability, and fatigue resistance. The choice of material depends on factors such as the amount of torque to be transmitted, speed of rotation, environmental conditions, and cost considerations.  The size and geometry of the shaft are also crucial. The diameter of the shaft affects its ability to withstand bending and torsional stresses. Factors such as shaft length, location of bearings, and the presence of keyways or threads must be taken into account during the design process. Additionally, fillets and chamfers are often incorporated to reduce stress concentrations and improve the fatigue life of the shaft.  Shafts are classified based on their shape and function. Common types include solid shafts, which are simple and robust, and hollow shafts, which are lighter and more suitable for applications where weight is a concern. Stepped shafts and splined shafts are used when different components with varying diameters need to be connected.  Power transmission through shafts involves the transfer of mechanical energy from one part of a machine to another. This process is fundamental in various applications, including automotive, aerospace, machinery, and industrial equipment. The design of shafts for power transmission must consider factors such as the amount of torque to be transmitted, the speed of rotation, alignment accuracy, and the presence of any shock loads or vibrations.  Shafts are often connected to other machine components using couplings. Couplings allow for the transmission of torque while compensating for misalignments and facilitating easy installation and maintenance. Common types of couplings include rigid couplings, flexible couplings, gear couplings, and fluid couplings, each suited for specific applications and operating conditions.  In power transmission systems, shafts may also feature keyways, splines, or other connection methods to ensure a secure and efficient transfer of torque. Proper alignment of shafts is crucial to prevent excessive wear, vibration, and premature failure of machine components. Misaligned shafts can lead to increased friction, reduced efficiency, and ultimately, system breakdown.  Shaft design must also consider factors such as lubrication and cooling. Proper lubrication helps reduce friction and wear between moving parts, extending the life of the shaft and associated components. Cooling systems may be necessary for high-speed or high-torque applications to prevent overheating and maintain optimal operating conditions.  Overall, shaft design and power transmission are integral elements of mechanical engineering, influencing the performance and longevity of various machines and systems. By understanding the principles of shaft design, selecting appropriate materials, considering factors like geometry and alignment, and incorporating efficient power transmission methods, engineers can optimize the efficiency and reliability of their designs in diverse applications.""","623"
"Nadin Mihai 1938 ","""When we write, we visualize, making our language visible on paper. When we draw, we make our plans for new artifacts visible. The mediation introduced by the computer use does not affect the condition of language as long as the computer is only the pen, keyboard, or typewriter. But once we encode language rules (such as spelling, case agreement, and so on), once we store our vocabulary and our grammar, and mimic human use of language, what is written is only partially the result of the literacy of the writer. The visualization of text is the starting point towards automatic creation of other texts. It also leads to establishing relations between language and non-language sign systems. Today, we dispose of means for electronically associating images and texts, for cross-referencing images and texts, and for rapidly diagramming texts. We can, and indeed do, print electronic journals, which are refereed on the network. Nothing prevents such journals from inserting images, animation and sounds, or for facilitating on-line reactions to the hypotheses and scientific data presented. That such publications need a shorter time to reach their public goes without saying. The Internet thus became the new medium of publication, and the computer its printing press-a printing press of a totally new condition. Individuals constituting their identity on the Internet have access to resources which until recently were available only to those who owned presses, or gained access to them by virtue of their privileged position in society. The visual component of computer processing, i.e., the graphics, relies on the same language of zeros and ones through which the entire computer processing takes place. As a result of this common alphabet and grammar (Boolean logic and its new extensions), we can consider language (image translations, or number-image relations such as diagrams, charts, and the like), and also more abstract relations. Creating the means to overcome the limitations of literacy has dominated scientific work. The new means for information processing allow us to replace the routine of phenomenological observation with processing of diverse languages designed especially to help us create new theories of very complex and dynamic phenomena. The shift to the visual follows the need to change the accent from quantitative evaluations and language inferences based on them, to qualitative evaluations, and images expressing such evaluations at some significant moments of the process in which we are involved. Let us mention some of these processes. In medicine, or in the research for syntheses of new substances, and in space research, words have proven to be not only misleading, but also inefficient in many respects. New visualization techniques, such as those based on molecular resonance, freed the praxis of medicine from the limitations of word descriptions. Patients explain what they feel; physicians try to match such descriptions to typologies of disease based on data resulting from the most recent data. When this process is networked, the most qualified physician can be consulted. When experimental data and theoretic models are joined, the result is visualized and the information exchanged via high-speed broadband digital networks. Based on similar visualization techniques, we acquire better access to sources of data regarding the past, as well as to information vital for carrying through projects oriented towards the future. Computed tomography, for instance, visualized the internal structure of Egyptian mummies. Three-dimensional images of the whole body were created without violating the casings and wrappings that cover the remnants. The internal body structure was visualized by using a simulation system similar to those utilized in non-intrusive surgery. The design and production of new materials, space research, and nano- engineering have already benefited from replacing the analytical perspective ingrained in literacy-based methods with visual means for synthesis. It is possible to visualize molecular structures and simulate interactions of molecules in order to see how medicine affects the cells treated, the dynamics of mixing, chemical and biochemical reactions. It is also possible to simulate forces involved in the so-called docking of molecules in virtual space. No literacy-based description can substitute for flight simulators, or for visualization of data from radio astronomy, for large areas of genetics and physics. Not the last among examples to be given is the still controversial field of artificial intelligence, seduced with emulating behaviors usually associated with human intelligence in action. But it should not surprise anybody that while the dynamics of the civilization of illiteracy requires freedom from literacy, people will continue to preserve values and concepts they are used to, or which are appropriate to specific knowledge areas. Paradoxically, artificial intelligence is, in part, doing exactly this. When people grow up with images the same way prior generations were subjected to literacy, the relation to images changes. The technology for visualization, although sometimes still based on language models, makes interactivity possible in ways language could not. But it is not only the technology of visualization applied within science and engineering that marks the new development. Visualization, in its various forms and functions, supports the almost instantaneous interaction between us and our various machines, and among people sharing the same natural environment, or separated in space and time. It constitutes an alternative medium for thinking and creativity, as it did all along the history of crafts, design, and engineering. It is also a medium for understanding our environment, and the multitude of changes caused by practical experience involving the life support system. Through visualization, people can experience dimensions of space beyond their direct perception, they can consider the behavior of objects in such spaces, and can also expand the realm of artistic creativity. The print media, as an overlapping practical experience uniting literacy and the power of sight, are more visual today than at any previous time. We are no longer subjected-sometimes with good reason, other times for dubious motives-to the sequentiality of literacy-dominated modes of communication. An entire shared visual language is projected upon us in the form of comic strips, advertisements, weather maps, economic reports, and other pictorial representations. Some of these representations are still printed on paper. Others are displayed through the more dynamic forms at public information kiosks, or through interactive means of information dissemination, such as computer-supported networks and non-linear search environments, which Ted Nelson anticipated back in 965/8. The World Wide Web embodies many of his ideas, as well as ideas of a number of other visionaries. Parallel to these developments, we are becoming more and more aware of the possibilities of using images in human activities where they played a reduced role within literacy-civic action, political debate, legal argumentation. Lawyers already integrate visual testimony in their cases. Juries can see for themselves the crime being committed, as well as the results of sophisticated forensic tests. Human destinies are defended with arguments that are no longer at the mercy of someone's memory or another's talent for rhetoric or drama. The citizen is frequently addressed by increasingly visual messages that explain how tax dollars are spent and why he or she should vote for one or another candidate. In becoming the Netizen, he or she will participate in social interactions fundamentally new in nature. On the Net, politicians claiming credit for some accomplishment can be immediately challenged by the real image. Political promises can be modeled and displayed while the campaign speech is given. A decision to go to war can be subjected to an instant referendum while the simulation of the war itself, or of alternatives, is played on our monitors. But again, to idealize these possibilities would be foolish. The potential for abusive use of images is as great as that for their meaningful application. Many factors are at work slowing down the process of educating visually literate individuals. We continue to rediscover the wheel of reading and writing without advancing comprehensive programs for visual education. Illustrative visual alternatives, advanced more as an alibi for the maintenance of literacy-dominated communication, are by the nature of their function inappropriate in the context of higher efficiency requirements. Utilized as alternatives, these materials can be, and often are, irrelevant, ugly, insignificant, and expensive. More often than not, they are used not to enhance communication, but to direct it, to manipulate the addressee. It will take more than the recognition of the role of the visual to understand that visual literacy, or probably several such literacies, comprising the variety of visual languages we need, less confining, less permanent, and less patterned, are necessary in order to improve practical experiences of self-constitution through images. We are yet to address the ethical aspects of such experiences, especially in view of the fact that the visual entails constraints different from those encoded in the letter of our laws and moral principles. In discussing the transition to the visual, I hope to have made clear that the process is not one of substituting one form of literacy for another. The process has a totally different dynamics. It implies transition from a dominating form of literacy to a multitude of highly adaptive sign systems. These all require new competencies that reflect this adaptability.""","""Visualization in Communication and Literacy""","1768","""Visualization is a powerful tool in enhancing communication and promoting literacy across various fields. Through the use of images, diagrams, infographics, and other visual aids, complex ideas can be simplified, information can be better understood, and engagement can be heightened. In today's fast-paced world, where information is constantly bombarding us from various sources, visuals play a crucial role in capturing attention and conveying messages effectively. Whether in educational settings, marketing campaigns, business presentations, or everyday conversations, visualization is key to conveying information in a clear, concise, and engaging manner.  In the realm of communication, visualization serves as a bridge between ideas and understanding. By incorporating visuals into written or spoken communication, concepts that may be difficult to grasp through words alone can be made more accessible and memorable. Visual aids can include charts, graphs, maps, timelines, and diagrams, among others, each tailored to support specific types of information and enhance comprehension. For instance, a sales report may be more impactful when presented as a series of graphs showing revenue trends over time, rather than a text-heavy document listing numbers. The visual representation of data can bring numbers to life, allowing viewers to quickly interpret trends and draw meaningful insights.  One of the key benefits of using visualization in communication is its ability to appeal to different learning styles. While some individuals may excel at processing textual information, others may find it easier to understand and retain information when presented visually. By incorporating both written content and visual elements, communicators can cater to a wider audience and increase the likelihood of effectively conveying their message. This multi-modal approach is particularly beneficial in educational settings, where students with diverse learning preferences can benefit from a combination of text, images, and interactive visuals to deepen their understanding of complex topics.  In the context of literacy, visualization plays a vital role in developing reading and comprehension skills, especially in children. Picture books, graphic novels, and other visual storytelling formats not only make reading more engaging and enjoyable for young readers but also help them build their vocabulary, improve their comprehension, and foster their imagination. By pairing text with illustrations, children can better grasp the meaning of words, infer context from visuals, and develop a deeper connection with the story being told. Visual literacy, the ability to interpret and create visual messages, is an essential complement to traditional literacy skills, enabling individuals to navigate the visually rich environments of today's digital world.  Moreover, visualization can be a powerful tool for fostering creativity and critical thinking among learners of all ages. When individuals are encouraged to create their own visuals to represent ideas or concepts, they are challenged to think creatively, make connections between different pieces of information, and communicate their thoughts in a visual format. This process not only enhances their understanding of the material but also cultivates their problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, and ability to present information in a meaningful and engaging way. By incorporating visual literacy activities into educational curricula, teachers can empower students to become more effective communicators and lifelong learners.  In the professional realm, visualization is widely used to streamline complex information, facilitate decision-making, and engage stakeholders. In business settings, data visualization tools enable organizations to transform raw data into actionable insights, helping teams identify trends, track performance metrics, and make informed decisions based on visual representations of information. Infographics, in particular, have become a popular medium for condensing large amounts of data into visually appealing and easy-to-understand formats, making them ideal for presenting information to colleagues, clients, or the general public.  Furthermore, in marketing and advertising, visual communication plays a central role in capturing audience attention, conveying brand messages, and influencing consumer behavior. From eye-catching graphics in social media campaigns to visually stunning product packaging on store shelves, brands leverage the power of visuals to create memorable experiences and establish strong emotional connections with their target audience. By tapping into the visual preferences and psychological responses of consumers, marketers can craft compelling visual narratives that resonate with their desired demographic and drive engagement with their products or services.  In the digital age, where content consumption is increasingly visual-centric, the demand for effective visual communication skills is on the rise. Individuals who possess the ability to create engaging visuals, whether through graphic design, video production, animation, or other visual mediums, have a competitive edge in a wide range of industries. Employers value professionals who can translate complex information into visually compelling stories, as these skills are essential for crafting persuasive presentations, designing user-friendly interfaces, and producing visually captivating marketing materials.  As technology continues to advance, new tools and platforms are emerging to support and enhance visual communication practices. From interactive data visualization software to virtual and augmented reality applications, innovators are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of visual storytelling. These technological advancements offer exciting opportunities for communicators, educators, marketers, and creatives to explore new ways of leveraging visuals to engage audiences, convey messages with impact, and spark meaningful interactions in both online and offline environments.  In conclusion, visualization is a versatile and indispensable tool for enhancing communication and promoting literacy across various contexts. Whether used to simplify complex ideas, engage diverse audiences, foster creativity, or drive business success, visuals have the power to amplify the effectiveness of messages and create lasting impressions on viewers. By harnessing the potential of visuals in communication and literacy, individuals and organizations can elevate their storytelling capabilities, deepen audience engagement, and unlock new opportunities for sharing knowledge, inspiring action, and building meaningful connections in an increasingly visual world.""","1084"
"Beruete y Moret A de Aureliano ","""The study of this curious problem of painting, of the distinctive note, the inclination of the time, as shown in the art of father-in-law and son-in-law, has been the subject of several works from our pen. We have not insisted on the point in these, nor have we space to do so in this brief synthesis; but we flatter ourselves that several paintings, especially those which belong to museums, have come to be more correctly attributed to Mazo rather than to Velazquez, and that those who are interested in these problems have come to distinguish the external aspect of the work of the one from that of the other, substantial and inimitable. We must remark, however, that Mazo had, besides the mere qualities of an imitator, a talent of his own of singular excellence, that of a landscape painter, which represented a relative novelty in the art of Spain at that period. After Velazquez the most important painter of the School of Madrid is, beyond dispute, Carreno. Though his religious canvases are numerous, Carreno was, above all, a portrait painter. The relative influence of the work of Van Dyck, which extended as far as Seville, also reached Madrid, and Carreno came under it at times and discreetly made use of it. We say discreetly, for he had lost his national qualities. He borrowed from Velazquez the basic colours of his palette, but sought to enrich them with certain warm, golden tones, and he was enamoured of russets and, above all, of carmines, generally those which approximate to the colouring of the Flemings, but which appear cloying beside the works of Van Dyck. The portraits by Carreno were represented at the exhibition by that of A Young Lady (Plate XXII), belonging to the Duke of Medinaceli, which might almost be described as a black-and-white from its colouring and the evident purpose of the artist to preserve this tonality throughout the work; that of The Queen of Spain, Dona Mariana de Austria, the property of Don Ramon de la Sota, a most beautiful example, from which, without doubt, have been taken the many repetitions which are known of it besides other variants; and that of The Marchioness of Santa Cruz, which is of great importance and very characteristic. Of religious pictures it is necessary to mention The Apparition of the Virgin to Saint Bernard, sent from Bilbao by Don Antonio Plasencia. The two brothers Rizi, Juan and Francisco, were of Italian origin; both were decorative painters and worked in the style of Carducho and Caxes. Juan, the elder, was a monk, and was one of the prototypes of the School of Madrid, following Velazquez in his work, soberly and simply. Francisco seems at times to display the qualities of his Italian origin, and though sufficiently Spanish, gave to his creations a certain quality which may have influenced the Spanish decorative painters of the time. It is a curious problem of influence. In any case this artist, who achieved fame in his time, is an interesting study to-day, and it would seem that the critic must scrutinize the beginnings of the question before he tries to explain its results. Pereda, Collantes and Leonardo are also notable, if lacking the character of their school, which clearly shows them to be among the disciples of Carreno, among whom, perhaps, the most notable were Cerezo and Cabezalero, who unfortunately died young. Cerezo seems to be the most striking figure of those years, and his brilliant colour and fine style initiated a tendency which made for the enrichment of the Spanish palette, the sobriety of which we admire in the masters, but which degenerates into a certain poverty at times in the hands of their disciples. With Cerezo we should mention Antolinez, who also died before he reached artistic maturity. We now reach that era of painting which flourished at the Court of Spain during the remainder of the seventeenth century. A long list of names of artists could be made, all estimable and some remarkable, who exhibited the proverbial vigour and picturesque temperament of the race, which, skilfully directed, and having received a noble and traditional tendency, commenced its onward progress without faltering. We mention, however, only Claudio Coello, who seems to close this period. A disciple of Rizi, whose decorative tendency he followed, he was more an artist in a general sense than a portrait painter, and above all he produced many religious subjects. By his work The Sacred Form, which is kept in the Escurial, he seems to be sealed to the School of Madrid. This picture is obviously a result of the atmosphere and the taste of the period in its fidelity to character and its happy solution of problems of perspective and effects of light. For Spain the eighteenth century was a period of misfortune. The reasons for this are simple and evident. Grace and good taste--in the best sense of the term--lightness, came to be the characteristics of this century, and these qualities were displayed in a perfect manner in French art. And it was precisely these attributes which Spanish artists most lacked, and still lack. They are robust, strong and sincere, but without gracefulness, facility of expression or volatility. A propos of this, it must be recalled that Spanish artistic expression appears to have been more or less influenced in its development by foreign tendencies which were allowed to work freely and with absolute spontaneity. The eighteenth century was a period in which the most powerful external influences, especially the French, the least adaptable to the Spanish temperament, had full play. These external influences were wholly ordained by the rule of the House of Bourbon, and incarnated in the first of its monarchs, Philip V, nephew of Louis XIV, who, doubtless meaning well, seemed to think it possible to transplant Versailles, with its marvellous spirit and exquisite culture, to the Castilian cities, which were still dominated by the sobriety and asceticism of the mystics of past centuries. As regards painting, these influences commenced with the arrival at the Court of Lucas Jordan, who represented the influence of the great Italian decorative artists. Afterwards came Tiepolo, who left many marvellous works, quite inimitable by Spanish artists. The Bourbons introduced Van Loo, Ranc, Houasse and other French representatives of the art of the time; and lastly came Mengs, bringing with him a spirit wholly distinct from that of the French, a style erudite and academic which was not sufficiently powerful to create an artistic output of any importance in Spain, but which possessed much destructive power, although that was limited as regards time to about a century, during which period the national production was weak, despite the number of artists, of whom those most worthy to be mentioned are Maella, the Bayeus and Paret. Such was the condition of Spanish painting when, without precedent, reason or motive, appeared in the province of Aragon, a region which years afterwards came to typify the resistance to foreign invasion, a figure of great significance in Spanish art, and worthy of comparison with the greatest masters of the preceding centuries--Francisco de Goya. The long life of Goya coincides with an epoch which divides two ages. The critic is somewhat at a loss how to place his work and personality, to conclude whether he is the last of the old masters or the first of the moderns. His greatness is so obvious, his performance so vast and its gradual evolution so manifest, that we may be justified in holding that the first portion of his effort belongs to the old order of things, while the second must be associated with the origins of modern painting. In his advance, in the manner and development of it, it is noticeable--as we have already said in certain of our works which deal with Goya--that he substituted for the picturesque, agreeable and suggestive note of his younger days, another more intense and more embracive. It would seem that the French invasion of the Peninsula, the horrors of which he experienced and depicted, influenced him profoundly in the alteration of his style. There is a Goya of the eighteenth century and a Goya of the nineteenth. But this is not entirely due to variation in technique, to mere artistic development, it is more justly to be traced to a change in creative outlook, in character, in view-point, which underwent a rude and violent transformation. Compare the subjects of his tapestries or of his festive canvases, joyful and gallant, facile in conception and at times almost trivial, with the tragic and macabre scenes of his old age, and with the drawings of this period and the compositions known as The Disasters of War. His spirit was fortified and nourished by the warmth of his imagination, and assisted by an adequate technique, marvellously suited to the expression of his ideas, he produced the colossal art of his later years. If his performance is studied with reference to the vicissitudes and the adventures of which it is eloquent, the influence upon his works of the times in which they were created is obvious. The changes in his life, the transference from those gay and tranquil years to others full of the horrors of blood and fire, of shame and banishment, tended, without doubt, to discipline his spirit and excite his intelligence. His natural bias to the fantastic and his tendency to adapt the world to his visions seized upon the propitious occasion in a time of invasion and war to exalt itself, or, as he himself expressed it, the dream of reason produces prodigies. An artist and creator more as regards expression than form, especially in the second phase of his work, unequal in achievement and at times inaccurate, he sacrificed much to divest himself of these faults. He deliberately set himself to discipline his ideas and develop that degree of boldness with which he longed to infuse them.""","""Spanish Painting and Influences""","2041","""Spanish painting has played a significant role in the art world, known for its rich history, diverse styles, and influential artists. From the medieval period to the present day, Spanish painting has evolved, drawing inspiration from various sources and showcasing a unique blend of cultural influences. In this exploration, we will delve into the origins of Spanish painting, major artistic movements, notable painters, and the influences that have shaped this vibrant tradition.  The roots of Spanish painting can be traced back to the medieval period, characterized by religious themes and Byzantine influences. One of the most famous examples of medieval Spanish painting is the Mozarabic Beatus manuscripts, illuminated texts that combine Christian iconography with Islamic geometric patterns. These manuscripts reflect the cultural fusion that was prevalent in Spain at the time, highlighting the artistic exchange between Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities.  During the Renaissance, Spanish painters began to embrace humanism and naturalism, drawing inspiration from Italian and Flemish art. Notable artists such as El Greco, a Greek painter who settled in Spain, blended Byzantine influences with Mannerism, creating his unique style characterized by elongated figures and dramatic use of color. El Greco's innovative approach to composition and emotion paved the way for future generations of Spanish artists.  The Golden Age of Spanish painting occurred during the 16th and 17th centuries, marked by the rise of Baroque art. Artists like Diego Velázquez, known for his meticulous attention to detail and innovative use of light and shadow, captured the essence of Spanish court life in his masterful portraits. Velázquez's iconic work, """"Las Meninas,"""" exemplifies his skill in creating depth and realism, influencing generations of painters to come.  Another prominent figure of the Spanish Baroque period was Francisco de Zurbarán, whose religious paintings are renowned for their spiritual intensity and realistic depiction of textures. Zurbarán's use of chiaroscuro and meticulous attention to detail imbue his works with a sense of quiet contemplation, reflecting the deeply religious atmosphere of Spain during this period.  In the 18th century, Spanish painting saw a shift towards Rococo and Neoclassical styles, influenced by European art movements. Artists like Francisco Goya emerged as a leading figure, known for his bold compositions and keen observation of human behavior. Goya's works, such as """"The Third of May 1808,"""" are powerful depictions of war and social injustice, showcasing his mastery of capturing raw emotion and political commentary.  The 19th century brought Romanticism to Spanish painting, with artists like Eugenio Lucas Velázquez and Marià Fortuny exploring themes of passion, exoticism, and nationalism. Velázquez's dynamic brushwork and vibrant colors captured the vibrancy of Spanish culture, while Fortuny's intricate Orientalist paintings reflected the fascination with distant lands and cultures.  The turn of the 20th century marked a period of artistic experimentation and avant-garde movements in Spain. The Catalan architect and designer Antoni Gaudí, known for his unconventional architectural style inspired by nature, created a unique blend of Art Nouveau and Gothic elements in his iconic buildings, such as the Sagrada Família in Barcelona.  The Spanish Civil War and its aftermath had a profound impact on Spanish painting, leading to the emergence of the avant-garde movement known as Surrealism. Artists like Salvador Dalí, Joan Miró, and Luis Buñuel challenged traditional artistic conventions, exploring the realms of the subconscious and dreams in their works. Dalí's melting clocks in """"The Persistence of Memory"""" and Miró's playful abstractions exemplify the surrealistic tendencies of Spanish art during this period.  In the post-war era, Spanish painting continued to evolve, with artists like Antoni Tàpies and Eduardo Chillida exploring abstract and conceptual approaches to art. Tàpies' use of mixed media and unconventional materials challenged the notion of painting as a purely visual medium, while Chillida's monumental sculptures integrated space and form in innovative ways.  Contemporary Spanish painting remains vibrant and diverse, drawing on a rich artistic heritage while exploring new themes and techniques. Artists like Miquel Barceló, known for his expressive brushwork and rich textures, continue to push the boundaries of painting, blending traditional methods with contemporary sensibilities. Barceló's bold experimentation with color and form reflects the dynamic nature of Spanish art in the 21st century.  In conclusion, Spanish painting is a dynamic and multifaceted tradition that has been shaped by a myriad of influences throughout history. From its medieval origins to the present day, Spanish artists have continuously reinvented and redefined the boundaries of painting, creating a rich tapestry of styles, themes, and techniques. By embracing both tradition and innovation, Spanish painting continues to captivate audiences worldwide, showcasing the enduring legacy of this vibrant artistic tradition.""","974"
"Govett Ernest","""Only one other example of the supreme use of drapery in this way seems to be known--a bronze sitting figure of Calliope, which is of the late Hellenistic period, and is obviously of the same school as the Ariadne marble. See Plate 9. Dreicer Collection, New York. NOTE 5/8. PAGE 12 Praxiteles is known to have executed at least four other statues of Aphrodite besides the Cnidian example, but this last is the only one as to which we have fairly complete records, and of which copies have been closely identified. It is also the most celebrated. We may therefore accept the work as typical for comparative purposes. NOTE 6. PAGE 13 There has been much discussion as to whether Apelles showed the same extent of figure as is represented in the sculpture, a common suggestion being that he brought the surface of the water to the waist line; but it is evident that the painting corresponded with the sculpture in this particular. The artist had to represent the goddess walking towards the shore. If he brought the water to the waist line he could not definitely suggest movement, as a deflection of the shoulder line might mean that the goddess was in an attitude of rest, corresponding to the pose of nearly all the sculptured figures of the Praxitelean school. On the other hand if he carried the water line down towards the knees, the advance of the right leg would be most marked, and the effect disturbing because of the loss of repose, a quality at all times valuable in a painting of a single figure, and really necessary in the representation of Venus. The artist very properly reduced the portion of the thighs visible to the smallest fraction possible compatible with an expression of movement, in order to give the figure the greatest repose attainable. Under any circumstances there was nothing to gain by showing the water reaching to the waist. Certain details of the picture by Apelles are to be obtained from Grecian epigrams. Thus, one by Antipater of Sidon contains these lines: Venus, emerging from her parent sea, Apelles' graphic skill does here portray: She wrings her hair, while round the bright drops flee, And presses from her locks the foamy spray. From this it would appear that the position of the goddess when painted was presumed to be comparatively near the artist, otherwise the separate drops of falling water would not have been observed. The last line in the following epigram by Leonides of Tarentum indicates the ideal character of the countenance, though evidence of this is scarcely necessary: As Venus from her mother's bosom rose (Her beauty with the murmuring sea-foam glows), Apelles caught and fixed each heavenly charm; No picture, but the life, sincere and warm. See how those finger tips those tresses wring! See how those eyes a calm-like radiance fling! Translated by Lord Neaves. Translated by Lord Neaves. NOTE 7. PAGE 24 So far as the writer knows, Piero was the only artist of the Renaissance who used this mythological story for a composition (his picture has hitherto been called an allegory), a circumstance which is rather singular considering the suitableness of the subject for the provision of effective designs. The Greek sculptors in dealing with the legend confined themselves to the moment when Athena threw down the pipes, apparently for the reason that this instant gave an opportunity of rendering Marsyas in a strong dramatic action. The famous statue of the faun after Myron in Rome, is supposed to have formed part of a group representing Athena and Marsyas immediately after the pipes were dropped, and the design appears on still existing coins and vases of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. Piero takes a later moment, showing Marsyas comfortably squatting in the foreground of a delightful fanciful landscape, expressing boyish satisfaction with the prizes he is about to try. He is properly shown as a satyr instead of in the faun form of the sculptor. There appears to be no legitimate place in painting for a faun, while a satyr may at times be appropriately introduced into a pastoral composition. NOTE 8. PAGE 25/8 Controversy has raged around this picture for something like seventy years. The work came to light before 85/80 at a public auction sale when it was attributed to Mantegna, with whom of course it had nothing to do. Then it was pronounced a Raphael, but this was disputed by Passavant who held that on account of the thin lower limbs of the figures, and the minute way in which the landscape was painted, it could not be by Raphael, but was of the school of Francia, or by Timoteo della Viti. Morelli brought back the attribution to Raphael, and the work then came into the possession of the Louvre. Subsequently Pinturicchio and Perugino were alternately suggested as the painter, and to the latter the picture was assigned by the Louvre authorities. All are agreed that the date of the work is about 5/802. It does not seem possible that Perugino could have painted the picture, for the subject and invention are entirely foreign to him, while the lithe active form of Apollo does not consort with the least formal of his known figures. The landscape is much in his manner, but so it is also in the style of Raphael's early period, while the small buildings therein are closely finished as in some of Raphael's other works of the time. Perugino used similar towers and buildings, but being a more experienced painter he did not so finely elaborate the details. The suggestion relating to the school of Francia was afterwards very properly withdrawn, and Pinturicchio must be ruled out on account of the landscape, apart from the supple figure of Apollo of which he was incapable. There remain then only Timoteo della Viti and Raphael as the possible painters of the work. But it cannot reasonably be suggested that Timoteo could have accomplished so perfect a figure as the Apollo, and moreover so original a figure. It certainly required an exceptionally bold mind to overcome the difficulty in rendering the traditionally semi-feminine form of Apollo by representing him as a young man just past his teens. Besides, the general delicacy of the work is not in the style of Timoteo. Passavant's objection to the limbs is overruled by the presence of similar limbs in the Mond Crucifixion. It would seem then that Morelli was right in assigning the beautiful little picture to the youthful period of the greatest of all painters. See Portrait of a young Man at Budapest, and the Terranuova Virgin and Child at Berlin. NOTE 9. PAGE 38 The white races are here referred to merely by way of example, and there is no intention to suggest that the more or less uncivilized peoples have no perception of beauty. It is well known that both semi-civilized and savage races differ from the whites in the matter of beauty, and the fact has been partly responsible for several theories for explaining sthetic perception, notably that of association, laid down by Alison and Jeffrey, but long since discarded. Seeing that there is no difference in kind between the sense nerves of the whites and the blacks, they must necessarily act in the same way. That the blacks appreciate as beautiful forms which the whites disregard, seems to arise partly from want of experience, partly from training, and partly from neglect in the exercise of the sense nerves. Take for example an inhabitant of Morocco where corpulency is commonly regarded as an element of beauty in women. If none but Moroccan women are seen or pictured, it is impossible for a higher form of beauty than is to be found amongst them to be conceived, for the imagination cannot act beyond experience. In cases where the Moroccan has had experience of both white and black, it is certain that, other things being equal, the white woman would be the more admired, for this is the general experience among the black races, and is strikingly noticeable in America with the descendants of African tribes. The appreciation of very fat women can easily be understood on the ground of custom or training. A youthful Moroccan may be firmly of opinion that corpulency is not an element of beauty, but seeing that his older acquaintances hold a contrary view, he may well form the conclusion that his judgment is wrong, and so accept the decision of his more mature countrymen. It is quite common among the whites for people to doubt their own sthetic perceptions when an inferior work of art is put forward as a thing of beauty. The general want of appreciation of certain musical harmonies on the part of uncivilized peoples is undoubtedly due to the neglect of the sense nerves concerned, for these are not cultivated except to a small extent involuntarily. The most ignorant and poor of the whites unavoidably come into frequent contact with the simpler forms of art, but the savage races see only the result of their own handiwork. The uncivilized races can scarcely be expected to admire the higher reaches of art wherein intellectual considerations enter, except for their sensorial excellence. NOTE 0. PAGE 39 There seems to be some uncertainty as to whether Fragonard intended his splendid series of the Frick collection to represent the subjects usually assigned to them, namely, The Pursuit (or The Flight of Design, a title given to the original sketch for the picture); The Rendezvous (or The Surprise, or The Escalade); Souvenirs (or Confidences, or The Reader); The Lover Crowned (or Before the Painter); and The Abandonment (or The Reverie). It is suggested that the works have an allegorical signification connected with art, and certainly three of them--the first, second, and fourth--could be so interpreted. But magnificent paintings of this kind are usually fitted for many allegorical suggestions.""","""History of Classical Art Techniques""","2029","""Classical art techniques have played a significant role in shaping the aesthetic norms and artistic expressions for centuries. Understanding the history of classical art techniques provides valuable insight into the evolution of art and artistic practices. From ancient Greece and Rome to the Renaissance and beyond, artists have developed and refined various techniques that continue to inspire and influence artistry today.  Ancient Greek art, dating back to the 8th century BCE, is characterized by its emphasis on idealized forms, symmetry, and proportion. The Greeks pioneered techniques such as contrapposto, where figures are depicted in a natural and relaxed pose, and the use of foreshortening to create a sense of depth and realism. The art of sculpture, particularly in mediums like marble and bronze, flourished during this period, with artists like Phidias and Praxiteles known for their mastery of craftsmanship and attention to detail.  In addition to sculpture, ancient Greek artists excelled in vase painting, a technique that involved intricate designs and storytelling through detailed imagery. Techniques such as black-figure and red-figure painting were developed, showcasing scenes from mythology, daily life, and historical events. The emphasis on balance, harmony, and narrative clarity in Greek art laid the foundation for future artistic developments in the classical tradition.  The art of ancient Rome, heavily influenced by Greek aesthetics, further expanded on classical techniques and artistic practices. Roman artists excelled in portraiture, capturing the likeness and character of prominent figures through realistic and expressive depictions. Techniques such as verism, which emphasized portraying subjects truthfully, and the use of naturalistic details in sculptures and paintings, marked Roman art as distinctive and influential.  During the Renaissance period in Europe, from the 14th to the 17th centuries, classical art techniques experienced a revival and reinterpretation. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael embraced the principles of classical art, incorporating perspective, anatomy, and light and shadow to create realistic and emotionally resonant works of art. Oil painting became the dominant medium, allowing for greater richness of color and depth of detail in paintings.  One of the key innovations of the Renaissance was the development of linear perspective, a technique that creates the illusion of depth and spatial relationships on a two-dimensional surface. Artists used mathematical principles to achieve accurate proportions and vanishing points, resulting in compositions that appear three-dimensional and immersive. The mastery of perspective transformed the way artists approached composition and storytelling in their works.  The techniques of chiaroscuro and sfumato, championed by artists like Leonardo da Vinci, enabled the subtle modeling of light and shadow to create volume and atmosphere in paintings. Chiaroscuro, the use of strong contrasts between light and dark, added drama and intensity to compositions, while sfumato, the blending of tones to create soft transitions, imbued works with a sense of mystery and depth.  In addition to painting, artists during the Renaissance also excelled in other classical art forms such as sculpture and architecture. The revival of classical Greco-Roman motifs and architectural elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, contributed to the grandeur and humanistic spirit of Renaissance art and architecture. Artists like Donatello and Michelangelo brought an unparalleled level of skill and innovation to sculptural techniques, creating masterpieces that continue to inspire awe and admiration.  As art movements evolved over time, classical art techniques continued to be preserved, reinterpreted, and reimagined by subsequent generations of artists. The academic tradition of studying anatomy, perspective, and composition remained a cornerstone of artistic education, informing the works of artists across different periods and styles.  In the 19th century, with the rise of movements like Romanticism and Realism, artists began to challenge classical conventions and experiment with new forms of expression. Techniques such as impasto, where paint is applied thickly to create texture and depth, and en plein air painting, which involves working outdoors to capture light and atmosphere, reflected a shift towards more personal and spontaneous approaches to art making.  The 20th century witnessed a proliferation of art movements, from Cubism and Surrealism to Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art, each pushing the boundaries of traditional techniques and conventions. Artists like Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Jackson Pollock, and Andy Warhol introduced new ways of seeing and creating art, often breaking away from classical norms and embracing experimentation and innovation.  Despite the diversity and complexity of modern and contemporary art practices, classical art techniques continue to be celebrated and studied for their timeless beauty, technical mastery, and enduring impact on the history of art. Artists today draw inspiration from classical traditions, adapting and reinterpreting these techniques to create works that resonate with contemporary audiences and address current socio-political themes and concerns.  In conclusion, the history of classical art techniques is a rich tapestry of innovation, skill, and creativity that has shaped the course of art history. From the precision and idealism of ancient Greek art to the realism and humanism of the Renaissance, classical techniques have provided a foundation for artistic exploration and expression across cultures and time periods. By understanding and appreciating the evolution of classical art techniques, we gain a deeper appreciation for the craftsmanship, vision, and enduring legacy of artists throughout history.""","1045"
"Tracy Roger Sherman","""One sample consisted entirely of roasted hominy. Three samples of coffee extract consisted chiefly of caramel and licorice, and contained no coffee. (Lattimore.) Pure coffee swims in water, and colors it slowly. Chiccory sinks and colors water rapidly. Peas sink and color water slowly. Rye sinks more rapidly than coffee, and colors water more quickly. Ground coffee is hard and crumbles between the teeth; chiccory is soft and does not crumble. =Gin.= No injurious adulterations detected. Twenty-five samples. (Engelhardt.) =Honey.= Three samples: two pure. One, labeled white-clover honey, contained 0 per cent of artificial glucose. The presence of added glucose is indicated by the turbidity produced by oxalic acid in a solution of the honey in distilled water. This turbidity is due to the presence of gypsum in artificial glucose a substance which is not contained in pure honey. (Pitt.) =Horse-radish.= Often harmlessly adulterated with grated turnip. =Isinglass.= Two samples. Both were common gelatine. (Chester.) =Jellies.= Fruit-jellies are often simple apple-jelly, flavored with artificial essences and colored with aniline. Safest not to use them unless their source is known to be trustworthy. =Lard.= Twenty-eight samples. Fifteen pure; the rest contained water. Good lard should melt to a clear fat without sputtering. =Meat.= Sound fresh meat is pale red when first cut, the surface after exposure turning to a deep red. The meat of animals that have died a natural death is of a deep purple color, not having been bled. The greatest danger in meat, however, is that due to the presence of trichin, which are killed by a temperature of 60 Fahr. All forms of pork should therefore be cooked thoroughly before eating. (Chester.) by meat is generally caused by some kind of preserved. Water 8. - 00. =Method of using the Lactometer.= Put the milk in a vessel so deep that the lactometer, when introduced and allowed to float, shall not touch the bottom. Notice the reading of the scale at the surface of the milk. If it is less than 00, it gives the percentage of milk in the sample. For example, if the reading be 0, the sample contains 0 per cent of milk and 0 per cent of water. =Sources of Error.= Milk very rich in cream may possibly, though not probably, register less than 00, but its very appearance will show that it has not been thinned by water or by skimming. Skimmed milk, especially if a little salt has been added, may register high above 00, but its thinness and blueness will show that it has been doctored. Condensed milk was carefully analyzed, and found to be unobjectionable. (C. E. Munsell, Ph. D.) =Olive-Oil.= Often adulterated with poppy, cotton-seed, ground or peanut, sesame, rape-seed, colza or beechnut oil, all harmless. Sixteen samples; nine adulterated. (Caldwell.) =Pickles.= Nine samples. None contained copper or any other metal. The only sample that possessed a suspiciously green appearance was found to contain alum. (Lattimore.) =Rum.= Twenty-five samples. No objectionable additions found. (Engelhardt.) =Sirups.= Three samples of maple-sirup. Two were pure, and one, manufactured in Chicago and sold in cans, contained 5/8 per cent of artificial glucose. In 870 Dr. Chandler found.2 per cent of tin in each of two samples of sugar-house sirups. This represents. grain of tin to the gallon. A common adulterant of sirups is glucose, which diminishes their sweetening power, but is not considered injurious. =Spices.= One hundred and eighty samples, comprising mustard, ginger, allspice, cinnamon, cassia, cloves, white, black, and red pepper, mace, and nutmeg. One hundred and twelve were adulterated from 0 to 1. per cent. All the adulterations were have been many exaggerated statements put forth regarding the adulteration of sugar. In 870 Dr. Chandler reported to the New York City Board of Health that sixty samples of sugar bought at small groceries were found pure and unadulterated without exception. In 872, Elwyn Waller, for the same board, examined one hundred and nine samples of powdered sugar, but found no adulteration. Powdered sugar is quite generally believed to be adulterated with gypsum or flour. As both of these adulterants are insoluble in water, it is easy for any one to convince himself of the purity of sugar by dissolving it in water. =Teas.= Forty-three samples of green tea, and eighteen of black. Many were cheap and of very inferior quality, some mere tea rubbish, yet no leaf, or fragment of a leaf, which was examined, could be considered anything but tea. No adulterations were found, and even the admixture of exhausted leaves could not be positively asserted. (Lattimore.) Suspected leaves should be wet and spread out, and then compared with leaves known to be genuine. It is said that exhausted leaves of green tea are often colored or faced with plumbago, Prussian blue, soapstone, etc., so artfully that only an expert can detect the fraud. Black tea is generally pure. =Vinegar.= Four samples, all poor, but not adulterated, unless with water. (Lattimore.) =Whisky.= Twenty-five samples. Fusel-oil decided in twenty, and traces in the rest. No injurious adulteration found. It is evident that the addition of water and coloring-matter is practiced more than any other adulteration. (Engelhardt.) =Wine.= A good wine should be transparent, and should have a bouquet. When pouring it into a glass, it should sparkle. A sour taste is always a sign of poor wine. Dizziness and headache are not produced by drinking pure wine. Cloudy, discolored, highly colored wines are suspicious. There are various substances used in the manufacture of wine which should be classed as adulterations, e.g., calcined plaster is added to the grape-juice during test is to concentrate the wine, and dip in a piece of pure white woolen-yarn. The natural red coloring-matter of wine does not dye without a mordant, while fuchsine and cochineal dye it red or pink. V.. In cities and towns which have a common water-supply, the water sometimes contains impurities dissolved from the pipes through which it runs, or dirt and vegetable debris stirred up from the bottom of the sources of supply, or brought down into them by heavy storms or melting snows. Service-pipes are usually made of lead, and, after moderate use, become coated on their internal surface with insoluble compounds (sulphate of lead), which prevent contamination of the water by them.""","""Food Adulteration Analysis""","1503","""Food adulteration analysis is a critical aspect of ensuring the safety and quality of the food we consume. Adulteration occurs when a food product is intentionally debased by adding inferior, harmful, or cheaper substances. This practice not only compromises the nutritional value of the food but also poses serious health risks to consumers. In response to the growing concern over food adulteration, regulatory bodies and food testing laboratories employ various techniques to detect and prevent adulteration in food products.  One of the primary reasons for food adulteration is economic gain. Unscrupulous individuals or entities engage in adulteration to increase profits by diluting expensive ingredients with cheaper alternatives. For example, adding water to milk, mixing cheaper oils with premium ones, or using artificial colors to enhance the appearance of fruits and vegetables are common ways in which food adulteration is carried out. These practices not only deceive consumers but also undermine the integrity of the food supply chain.  To combat food adulteration effectively, rigorous testing and analysis methods are employed to detect adulterants in food products. These testing methods rely on a combination of chemical, physical, and biological analyses to identify the presence of adulterants. Some common techniques used in food adulteration analysis include chromatography, spectroscopy, immunoassays, and DNA-based methods. These techniques allow for the accurate quantification and identification of adulterants in various food products.  Chromatography is a widely used analytical technique that separates and detects components in a sample based on their differential distribution between two phases – a stationary phase and a mobile phase. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) are commonly used methods in food adulteration analysis. These techniques help in detecting the presence of additives, contaminants, and adulterants in food samples with high sensitivity and specificity.  Spectroscopic methods, such as infrared spectroscopy (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, are also valuable tools in food adulteration analysis. These methods rely on the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter to provide information about the chemical composition of a sample. By analyzing the characteristic absorption or emission patterns of different substances, spectroscopic techniques can detect adulterants in food products.  Immunoassays are another important tool in food adulteration analysis, particularly for detecting allergens or specific proteins in food. Immunoassays work by using antibodies to detect and quantify the presence of a target antigen in a sample. These assays are highly sensitive and can detect trace amounts of allergens or contaminants that may pose health risks to consumers.  DNA-based methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing, are increasingly being used in food adulteration analysis to identify the species origin of food products. These methods can detect the presence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), species substitution, or adulteration in food products. By analyzing the unique genetic signatures of different species, DNA-based methods can help in verifying the authenticity and quality of food products.  In addition to these analytical techniques, food testing laboratories also rely on reference materials, proficiency testing programs, and quality assurance practices to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their results. Reference materials are standardized samples with known concentrations of analytes that help laboratories validate their testing methods and calibrate their instruments. Proficiency testing programs involve external quality assessments where laboratories analyze blind samples to evaluate their performance and accuracy in detecting adulterants.  Quality assurance practices, such as adhering to international standards like ISO 17025 and following good laboratory practices (GLP), are essential for ensuring the reliability and validity of food adulteration analysis results. By maintaining strict quality control measures, laboratories can uphold the integrity of their testing procedures and provide trustworthy data to regulatory authorities and food manufacturers.  Overall, food adulteration analysis plays a crucial role in safeguarding public health and ensuring the integrity of the food supply chain. By employing advanced analytical techniques, quality assurance measures, and regulatory oversight, we can detect and prevent adulteration in food products, thereby protecting consumers from potential health hazards and maintaining trust in the food industry. Constant vigilance, continuous research, and collaboration between regulatory agencies, food manufacturers, and testing laboratories are essential in the ongoing effort to combat food adulteration and uphold food safety standards.""","868"
"Mach Ernst","""This curious fact is the foundation of the familiar jokes played with the portraits of unpopular personages, which are so drawn that in the upright position of the page an exact picture of the person is presented, but on being inverted some popular animal is shown. It is a fact, then, that the two halves of a vertically symmetrical figure are easily confounded and that they therefore probably produce very nearly the same sensations. The question, accordingly, arises, why do the two halves of a vertically symmetrical figure produce the same or similar sensations? The answer is: Because our apparatus of vision, which consists of our eyes and of the accompanying muscular apparatus is itself vertically symmetrical. Whatever external resemblances one eye may have with another they are still not alike. The right eye of a man cannot take the place of a left eye any more than a left ear or left hand can take the place of a right one. By artificial means, we can change the part which each of our eyes plays. (Wheatstone's pseudoscope.) But we then find ourselves in an entirely new and strange world. What is convex appears concave; what is concave, convex. What is distant appears near, and what is near appears far. The left eye is the reflexion of the right. And the light-feeling retina of the left eye is a reflexion of the light-feeling retina of the right, in all its functions. The lense of the eye, like a magic lantern, casts images of objects on the retina. And you may picture to yourself the light-feeling retina of the eye, with its countless nerves, as a hand with innumerable fingers, adapted to feeling light. The ends of the visual nerves, like our fingers, are endowed with varying degrees of sensitiveness. The two retin act like a right and a left hand; the sensation of touch and the sensation of light in the two instances are similar. Examine the right-hand portion of this letter T: namely, T. Instead of the two retin on which this image falls, imagine feeling the object, my two hands. The T, grasped with the right hand, gives a different sensation from that which it gives when grasped with the left. But if we turn our character about from right to left, thus: T, it will give the same sensation in the left hand that it gave before in the right. The sensation is repeated. If we take a whole T, the right half will produce in the right hand the same sensation that the left half produces in the left, and vice versa. The symmetrical figure gives the same sensation twice. If we turn the T over thus: T, or invert the half T thus: L, so long as we do not change the position of our hands we can make no use of the foregoing reasoning. The retin, in fact, are exactly like our two hands. They, too, have their thumbs and index fingers, though they are thousands in number; and we may say the thumbs are on the side of the eye near the nose, and the remaining fingers on the side away from the nose. With this I hope to have made perfectly clear that the pleasing effect of symmetry is chiefly due to the repetition of sensations, and that the effect in question takes place in symmetrical figures, only where there is a repetition of sensation. The pleasing effect of regular figures, the preference which straight lines, especially vertical and horizontal straight lines, enjoy, is founded on a similar reason. A straight line, both in a horizontal and in a vertical position, can cast on the two retin the same image, which falls moreover on symmetrically corresponding spots. This also, it would appear, is the reason of our psychological preference of straight to curved lines, and not their property of being the shortest distance between two points. The straight line is felt, to put the matter briefly, as symmetrical to itself, which is the case also with the plane. Curved lines are felt as deviations from straight lines, that is, as deviations from symmetry. The presence of a sense for symmetry in people possessing only one eye from birth, is indeed a riddle. Of course, the sense of symmetry, although primarily acquired by means of the eyes, cannot be wholly limited to the visual organs. It must also be deeply rooted in other parts of the organism by ages of practice and can thus not be eliminated forthwith by the loss of one eye. Also, when an eye is lost, the symmetrical muscular apparatus is left, as is also the symmetrical apparatus of innervation. It appears, however, unquestionable that the phenomena mentioned have, in the main, their origin in the peculiar structure of our eyes. It will therefore be seen at once that our notions of what is beautiful and ugly would undergo a change if our eyes were different. Also, if this view is correct, the theory of the so-called eternally beautiful is somewhat mistaken. It can scarcely be doubted that our culture, or form of civilisation, which stamps upon the human body its unmistakable traces, should not also modify our conceptions of the beautiful. Was not formerly the development of all musical beauty restricted to the narrow limits of a five-toned scale? The fact that a repetition of sensations is productive of pleasant effects is not restricted to the realm of the visible. To-day, both the musician and the physicist know that the harmonic or the melodic addition of one tone to another affects us agreeably only when the added tone reproduces a part of the sensation which the first one excited. When I add an octave to a fundamental tone, I hear in the octave a part of what was heard in the fundamental tone. (Helmholtz.) But it is not my purpose to develop this idea fully here. We shall only ask to-day, whether there is anything similar to the symmetry of figures in the province of sounds. Look at the reflexion of your piano in the mirror. You will at once remark that you have never seen such a piano in the actual world, for it has its high keys to the left and its low ones to the right. Such pianos are not manufactured. If you could sit down at such a piano and play in your usual manner, plainly every step which you imagined you were performing in the upward scale would be executed as a corresponding step in the downward scale. The effect would be not a little surprising. For the practised musician who is always accustomed to hearing certain sounds produced when certain keys are struck, it is quite an anomalous spectacle to watch a player in the glass and to observe that he always does the opposite of what we hear. But still more remarkable would be the effect of attempting to strike a harmony on such a piano. For a melody it is not indifferent whether we execute a step in an upward or a downward scale. But for a harmony, so great a difference is not produced by reversal. I always retain the same consonance whether I add to a fundamental note an upper or a lower third. Only the order of the intervals of the harmony is reversed. In point of fact, when we execute a movement in a major key on our reflected piano, we hear a sound in a minor key, and vice versa. It now remains to execute the experiments indicated. Instead of playing upon the piano in the mirror, which is impossible, or of having a piano of this kind built, which would be somewhat expensive, we may perform our experiments in a simpler manner, as follows: ) We play on our own piano in our usual manner, look into the mirror, and then repeat on our real piano what we see in the mirror. In this way we transform all steps upwards into corresponding steps downwards. We play a movement, and then another movement, which, with respect to the key-board, is symmetrical to the first. ) We place a mirror beneath the music in which the notes are reflected as in a body of water, and play according to the notes in the mirror. In this way also, all steps upwards are changed into corresponding, equal steps downwards. ) We turn the music upside down and read the notes from right to left and from below upwards. In doing this, we must regard all sharps as flats and all flats as sharps, because they correspond to half lines and spaces. Besides, in this use of the music we can only employ the bass clef, as only in this clef are the notes not changed by symmetrical reversal. You can judge of the effect of these experiments from the examples which appear in the annexed musical cut. (Page 02.) The movement which appears in the upper lines is symmetrically reversed in the lower. The effect of the experiments may be briefly formulated. The melody is rendered unrecognisable. The harmony suffers a transposition from a major into a minor key and vice versa. The study of these pretty effects, which have long been familiar to physicists and musicians, was revived some years ago by Von Oettingen. Now, although in all the preceding examples I have transposed steps upward into equal and similar steps downward, that is, as we may justly say, have played for every movement the movement which is symmetrical to it, yet the ear notices either little or nothing of symmetry. The transposition from a major to a minor key is the sole indication of symmetry remaining. The symmetry is there for the mind, but is wanting for sensation. No symmetry exists for the ear, because a reversal of musical sounds conditions no repetition of sensations. If we had an ear for height and an ear for depth, just as we have an eye for the right and an eye for the left, we should also find that symmetrical sound-structures existed for our auditory organs. The contrast of major and minor for the ear corresponds to inversion for the eye, which is also only symmetry for the mind, but not for sensation. By way of supplement to what I have said, I will add a brief remark for my mathematical readers.""","""Vision and symmetry in perception""","2028","""Vision is a complex sensory process that plays a crucial role in our perception of the world around us. One fascinating aspect of vision is the concept of symmetry and how it influences our perception of beauty, balance, and harmony. Symmetry refers to a balanced arrangement of parts on either side of a central point, line, or axis. It is a fundamental principle in art, architecture, nature, and even in our own bodies.  Symmetry is deeply ingrained in our visual system and is often associated with aesthetic pleasure. When we encounter symmetrical patterns, our brains automatically interpret them as more pleasing and attractive compared to asymmetrical ones. This preference for symmetry is not limited to humans; research has shown that animals also exhibit a preference for symmetrical patterns, suggesting that it may have evolutionary roots.  The human brain is wired to detect symmetry effortlessly and quickly. This ability is believed to stem from the brain's inherent efficiency in processing visual information. Symmetry allows our brains to organize and make sense of visual stimuli more easily, reducing cognitive load and enhancing our ability to perceive and interpret the world around us efficiently.  Symmetry plays a significant role in various aspects of our daily lives. In art and design, symmetry is a fundamental element that artists use to create visually appealing compositions. From classical architecture to modern graphic design, symmetry plays a crucial role in creating balance, harmony, and a sense of order in visual works. Symmetrical designs are often perceived as more elegant, sophisticated, and aesthetically pleasing compared to their asymmetrical counterparts.  Furthermore, symmetry is prevalent in nature, where it can be found in the shapes of leaves, flowers, snowflakes, and even in the human body. The natural world is replete with examples of breathtaking symmetry, from the radial symmetry of a sunflower to the bilateral symmetry of a human face. This pervasive presence of symmetry in nature further emphasizes its importance in our perception and understanding of the world.  Not only does symmetry enhance the aesthetic appeal of visual stimuli, but it also plays a crucial role in object recognition and categorization. Studies have shown that symmetrical objects are processed more efficiently and recognized more accurately compared to asymmetrical ones. This phenomenon, known as the """"symmetry advantage,"""" highlights the cognitive advantages of symmetry in visual perception.  Symmetry also influences our perceptions of beauty and attractiveness. Research in psychology has shown that symmetrical faces are often rated as more beautiful and attractive than asymmetrical faces. This preference for symmetry in facial features is believed to be linked to evolutionary theories of mate selection, where symmetry is considered a sign of genetic fitness and health.  In addition to its role in aesthetics and object recognition, symmetry has implications for our understanding of the brain's functioning. Studies have suggested that the brain's response to symmetry is related to the activation of specific neural mechanisms involved in visual processing. The perception of symmetry engages specialized neural networks that help us detect, process, and appreciate symmetrical patterns in our environment.  Moreover, symmetry is not limited to static visual stimuli but also plays a crucial role in motion perception. Motion symmetry, where objects move in a coordinated and balanced manner, can enhance our perception of fluidity, coherence, and directionality in visual scenes. Motion symmetry allows us to track moving objects more effectively and predict their trajectories, contributing to our overall perception of dynamic events.  The influence of symmetry on perception extends beyond the visual domain and can also impact our emotional responses and cognitive judgments. Studies have shown that symmetrical stimuli evoke positive emotions and elicit feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. On the other hand, asymmetrical stimuli may evoke feelings of uncertainty, discomfort, or unease due to the lack of balance and coherence in the visual patterns.  Furthermore, symmetry is not always synonymous with beauty and can be manipulated to create visual illusions and distortions. Artists and designers often play with symmetry to challenge our perceptions, create optical illusions, and evoke a sense of ambiguity or surrealism in their works. Through the deliberate use of symmetry, artists can subvert traditional notions of balance and harmony, encouraging viewers to question their preconceptions and engage with the artwork on a deeper level.  In conclusion, the concept of symmetry in perception is a multifaceted phenomenon that influences our visual experiences, cognitive processes, and emotional responses. From art and design to nature and the human body, symmetry plays a fundamental role in shaping our perceptions of beauty, balance, and harmony. By understanding the intricate relationship between symmetry and perception, we gain insight into the complexities of the human visual system and the fascinating ways in which our brains interpret and make sense of the world around us.""","917"
"Taine Hippolyte","""Again, the rigor of authority is mitigated, both in society and in the family; a father is now the companion of his children, and the citizen has become the equal of the noble. Human life, in short, displays a lesser degree of misery, and a lighter degree of oppression. But, as a counterpart of this, Ave see ambition and cupidity spreading their wings. Accustomed to comfort and luxuries, and obtaining here and there glimpses of happiness, man begins to regard happiness and comfort as his due. The more he obtains, the more exacting he becomes, and the more his pretensions exceed his acquisitions. The practical sciences also having made great progress, and instruction being diffused, liberated thought abandons itself to all daring enterprises; hence it happens that men, relinquishing the traditions which formerly regulated their beliefs, deem themselves capable, through intellect alone, of attaining to the highest truths. Questions of every kind are mooted, moral, political and religious; men seek knowledge by groping their way in every direction. For fifty years past we behold this strange conflict of systems and sects, each tendering us new creeds and perfect theories of happiness. Such a state of things has a wonderful effect on minds and ideas. The representative man, that is to say, the character who occupies the stage, and to whom the spectators award the most interest and sympathy, is the melancholy, ambitious dreamer--Rene, Faust, Werther and Manfred--a yearning heart, restless, wandering and incurably miserable. And he is miserable for two reasons. In the first place he is over-sensitive, too easily affected by the lesser evils of life; he has too great a craving for delicate and blissful sensations; he is too much accustomed to comfort; he has not had the semi-feudal and semi-rustic education of our ancestors; he has not been roughly handled by his father, whipped at college, obliged to maintain respectful silence in the presence of great personages, and had his mental growth retarded by domestic discipline; he has not been compelled, as in ancient times, to use his own arm and sword to protect himself, to travel on horseback, and to sleep in disagreeable lodgings. In the soft atmosphere of modern comfort and of sedentary habits, he has become delicate, nervous, excitable, and less capable of accommodating himself to the course of life which always exacts effort and imposes trouble. On the other hand, he is skeptical. Society and religion both being disturbed--in the midst of a pele-mele of doctrines and an irruption of new theories--his precocious judgment, too rapidly instructed, and too soon unbridled, precipitates him early and blindly off the beaten track made smooth for his fathers by habit, and which they have trodden, led on by tradition and governed by authority. All the barriers which served as guides to minds having fallen, he rushes forward into the vast, confusing field which is opened out before his eyes; impelled by almost superhuman ambition and curiosity he darts off in the pursuit of absolute truth and infinite happiness. Neither love, glory, knowledge nor power, as we find these in this world, can satisfy him; the intemperance of his desires, irritated by the incompleteness of his conquests and by the nothingness of his enjoyments, leaves him prostrate amid the ruins of his own nature, without his jaded, enfeebled, impotent imagination being able to represent to him the beyond which he covets, and the unknown what which he has not. This evil has been styled the great malady of the age. Forty years ago it was in full force, and under the apparent frigidity or gloomy impassibility of the positive mind of the present day it still subsists. I have not the time to show you the innumerable effects of a like state of mind on works of art. You may trace them in the great development of the lyrical, sentimental and philosophical poetry of France, Germany and England; again, in the corruption and enrichment of language and in the invention of new classes and of new characters in literature; in the style and sentiments of all the great modern writers, from Chateaubriand to Balzac, from Goethe to Heine, from Cowper to Byron, and from Alfieri to Leopardi. You will find analogous symptoms in the arts of design if you observe their feverish, tortured and painfully archeological style, their aim at dramatic effect, psychological expression, and local fidelity; if you observe the confusion which has befogged the schools and injured their processes; if you pay attention to the countless gifted minds who, shaken by new emotions, have opened out new ways; if you analyze the profound sympathy for scenery which has given birth to a complete and original landscape art. But there is another art, Music, which has suddenly reached an extraordinary development. This development is one of the salient characteristics of our epoch, and the dependence of this on the modern mind, the ties by which they are connected, I shall endeavor to point out to you. This art was born, and necessarily, in two countries where people sing naturally, Italy and Germany. It was gestating for a century and a half in Italy, from Palestrina to Pergolese, as formerly painting from Giotto to Massaccio, discovering processes and feeling its way in order to acquire its resources. At the commencement of the eighteenth century it suddenly burst forth, with Scarlatti, Marcello and Handel. This is a most remarkable epoch. Painting at this time ceased to nourish in Italy, and in the midst of political stagnation, voluptuous, effeminate customs prevailed, furnishing an assembly of sigisbes, Lindors and amorous ladies for the roulades and tender sentimental scenes of the opera. Grave, ponderous Germany, at that time the latest in acquiring self-consciousness, now succeeds in displaying the severity and grandeur of its religious sentiment, its profound knowledge, and its vague melancholy instincts in the sacred music of Sebastian Bach, anticipating the evangelical epic of Klopstock. Tn the old and in the new nation the reign and expression of sentiment is beginning. Between the two, half-Germanic and half-Italian, is Austria, conciliating the two spirits, producing Haydn, Gluck and Mozart. Music now becomes cosmopolite and universal on the confines of that great mental convulsion of souls styled the French Revolution, as formerly painting under the impulse of the great intellectual revival known under the name of the Renaissance. We need not be astonished at the appearance of this new art, for it corresponds to the appearance of a new genius--that of the ruling, morbid, restless, ardent character I have attempted to portray for you. It is to this spirit that Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Weber formerly addressed themselves, and to which Meyerbeer, Berlioz and Verdi are now striving to accommodate themselves. Music is the organ of this over-refined excessive sensibility and vague boundless aspiration; it is expressly designed for this service, and no art so well performs its task. And this is so because, on the one hand, music is founded on a more or less remote imitation of a cry which is the natural, spontaneous, complete expression of passion, and which, affecting us through a corporeal stimulus, instantly arouses involuntary sympathy, so that the tremulous delicacy of every nervous being finds in it its impulse, its echo, and its ministrant. On the other hand, founded on relationships of sounds which represent no living form, and which, especially in instrumental music, seem to be the reveries of an incorporeal soul, it is better adapted than any other art to express floating thoughts, formless dreams, objectless limitless desires, the grandiose and dolorous mazes of a troubled heart which aspires to all and is attached to nothing. This is why, along with the discontent, the agitations, and the hopes of modern democracy, music has left its natal countries and diffused itself over all Europe; and why you see at the present time the most complicated symphonies attracting crowds in France, where, thus far, the national music has been reduced to the song and the melodies of the Vaudeville. IX. The foregoing illustrations, gentlemen, seem to me sufficient to establish the law governing the character and creation of works of art. And not only do they establish it, but they accurately define it. In the beginning of this section I stated that the work of art is determined by an aggregate which is the general state of the mind and surrounding manners. We may now advance another step, and note precisely in their order each link of the chain, connecting together cause and effect. In the various illustrations we have considered, you have remarked first, a general situation, in other words, a certain universal condition of good or evil, one of servitude or of liberty, a state of wealth or of poverty, a particular form of society, a certain species of religious faith; in Greece, the free martial city, with its slaves; in the middle ages, feudal oppression, invasion and brigandage, and an exalted phase of Christianity; the court life of the seventeenth century; the industrial and studied democracy of the nineteenth, guided by the sciences; in short, a group of circumstances controlling man, and to which he is compelled to resign himself. This situation developes in man corresponding needs, distinct aptitudes and special sentiments--physical activity, a tendency to revery; here rudeness, and there refinement; at one time a martial instinct, at another conversational talent, at another a love of pleasure, and a thousand other complex and varied peculiarities.""","""Modernity and its existential dilemmas.""","2007","""Modernity and Its Existential Dilemmas  Modernity, characterized by rapid industrialization, technological advancement, and social change, has brought about profound transformations in the way individuals perceive the world and themselves. This period, which emerged in the late 18th century and continues to influence contemporary society, has ushered in a new era marked by progress, innovation, and a reevaluation of traditional norms and values. However, within this landscape of optimism and change, modernity has also given rise to existential dilemmas that challenge individuals' sense of self, morality, and purpose. In this exploration, we delve into the complexities of modernity and examine the existential dilemmas it poses to individuals in the 21st century.  One of the central existential dilemmas of modernity is the erosion of traditional belief systems and the loss of overarching meaning. The advent of scientific discoveries, secularism, and individualism has led to the questioning of religious dogma and societal values that once provided a sense of purpose and direction to people's lives. In the absence of clear guidelines on how to navigate the complexities of the modern world, individuals are left grappling with questions of existence, morality, and the ultimate meaning of life. This crisis of meaning can manifest in feelings of alienation, nihilism, and existential angst as individuals confront the void left by the disintegration of traditional belief systems.  Moreover, modernity has brought about a high degree of individual autonomy and freedom, which, while empowering, can also be overwhelming and disorienting. The proliferation of choices in all aspects of life, from career paths to relationships to lifestyle options, can lead to decision paralysis and a constant fear of making the wrong choice. In a world where options are limitless and the pressure to succeed is relentless, individuals are tasked with constructing their identities and defining their values amidst a sea of competing influences and expectations. This emphasis on self-creation and personal responsibility can trigger feelings of isolation and insecurity as individuals struggle to find their place in a rapidly changing and often unpredictable world.  Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancement in the modern era has blurred the boundaries between reality and virtuality, complicating individuals' perceptions of truth, authenticity, and selfhood. The pervasive influence of social media, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality has created new dimensions of existence where identities can be curated, manipulated, and amplified with ease. This digital landscape, while offering opportunities for connection and self-expression, also raises concerns about surveillance, privacy, and the erosion of genuine human interaction. In a world where one's digital persona can overshadow their true self, individuals are faced with the challenge of maintaining authenticity and integrity in an increasingly mediated reality.  In addition, the phenomenon of globalization in the modern era has interconnected individuals across borders and cultures, exposing them to a diverse array of worldviews, belief systems, and lifestyles. While this interconnectivity has the potential to foster empathy, understanding, and cooperation on a global scale, it also poses challenges to individuals' sense of identity and belonging. The erosion of local traditions and the homogenization of culture under the forces of globalization can lead to a loss of cultural roots and a sense of displacement for many individuals. The tension between the desire for global interconnectedness and the need for local rootedness presents a profound existential dilemma for individuals seeking to navigate the complexities of a rapidly shrinking world.  Furthermore, the existential dilemmas of modernity are compounded by pressing ecological concerns, such as climate change, resource depletion, and environmental degradation. The realization of humanity's impact on the planet and the urgent need for sustainable practices have sparked debates about the ethical implications of modern lifestyles and the responsibility of individuals to future generations. The existential threat posed by environmental crises forces individuals to confront their place within the larger ecosystem of the planet and consider the long-term consequences of their actions on the Earth and its inhabitants. This awareness of ecological interdependence and the fragility of the planet adds another layer of complexity to the existential dilemmas of modernity.  Despite the myriad existential dilemmas posed by modernity, there are also opportunities for individuals to engage with these challenges in a constructive and transformative manner. The pursuit of self-awareness, critical reflection, and ethical engagement can empower individuals to navigate the complexities of the modern world with resilience and integrity. By cultivating a sense of mindfulness, empathy, and connection to others, individuals can transcend the limitations of individualism and consumerism that characterize modern society and forge meaningful relationships and communities based on shared values and aspirations.  Moreover, embracing uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity as inherent aspects of the human experience can enable individuals to embrace the paradoxes and contradictions of modernity with equanimity and openness. By acknowledging the fluidity of identity, the contingent nature of truth, and the plurality of perspectives that define the modern era, individuals can cultivate a sense of humility and curiosity that allows for personal growth and intellectual exploration. This willingness to embrace the unknown and engage with the existential dilemmas of modernity can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself, others, and the world at large.  In conclusion, modernity has ushered in a new era of progress, innovation, and social change that poses profound existential dilemmas to individuals in the 21st century. The erosion of traditional belief systems, the proliferation of choices, the blurring of reality and virtuality, the challenges of globalization, and the ecological crises of our time all contribute to the complex landscape of modernity. However, by approaching these existential dilemmas with courage, compassion, and a commitment to self-discovery and ethical action, individuals can navigate the complexities of modernity with resilience, integrity, and a sense of purpose. In embracing the challenges and opportunities presented by modernity, individuals can cultivate a deeper understanding of themselves, their place in the world, and the possibilities for collective transformation in an era defined by change and uncertainty.""","1171"
"Sutherland George","""Even at the price quoted, namely per ton, the cost of nitrate of soda made with electrically combined atmospheric nitrogen compares very favourably with commercial nitrates as now imported for agriculture purposes. 'Chili nitrate,' in fact, is about fifty per cent. dearer. When wave-power and other forms of the stored energy of the wind have been properly harnessed in the service of mankind, the region around Niagara will only be one of thousands of localities at which nitrogenous manures can be manufactured electrically at a price far below the present cost of natural deposits of nitrate of soda. From the power stations all around the coasts, as well as from those on waterfalls and windy heights among the mountains, electric cables will be employed to convey the current for fixing the nitrogen of the air at places where the manures are most wanted. The rediscovery of the art of irrigation is one of the distinguishing features of modern industrial progress in agriculture. Extensive ruins and other remains in Assyria, Egypt, India, China and Central America prove beyond question that irrigation played a vastly more important part in the industrial life of the ancients than it does in that of modern mankind. This is true in spite of the fact that power and dominion ultimately fell to the lot of those races which originally dwelt in colder and more hilly or thickly-wooded regions, where the instincts of hunting and of warfare were naturally developed, so that, by degrees, the peoples who understood irrigation fell under the sway of those who neither needed nor appreciated it. In the long interval vast forests have been cleared away and the warlike habits of the northern and mountainous races have been greatly modified, but manufacturing progress among them has enabled them to perpetuate the power originally secured by the bow and the spear. The irrigating races of mankind are now held in fear of the modern weapons which are the products of the iron and steel industries, just as they were thousands of years ago terrorised by the inroads of the wild hunting men from the North. But the future of agriculture will very largely belong to a class of men who will combine in themselves the best attributes of the irrigationist and the man who knows how to use the iron weapon and the iron implement. As the manufacturing supremacy of the North becomes more and more assured by reason of the superior healthiness of a climate encouraging activity of muscle and brain, so the agricultural prospects of the warmer regions of the earth's surface will be improved by the comparative immunity of plant and of animal life from disease in a dry atmosphere. Sheep, cattle and horses thrive far better in a climate having but a scanty rainfall than in one having an abundance of wet; and so, also, does the wheat plant when the limited rains happen to be timed to suit its growth, and the best kinds of fruit trees when the same conditions prevail. All this points to an immense recrudescence of irrigation in the near future. Already the Californians and other Americans of the Pacific Slope have demonstrated that irrigation is a practice fully as well suited to the requirements of a thoroughly up-to-date people as it has been for long ages to those of the 'unchanging East'. But here again the question of cheap power obtrudes itself. The Chinese, Hindoos and Egyptians have long ago passed the stage at which the limited areas which were irrigable by gravitation, without advanced methods of engineering, have been occupied; and the lifting of water for the supplying of their paddy fields has been for thousands of years a laborious occupation for the poorest and most degraded of the rural population. In a system of civilisation in which transport costs so little as it does in railway and steam-ship freights, the patches of territory which can be irrigated by water brought by gravitation from the hills or from the upper reaches of rivers are comparatively easy of access to a market. This fact retards the advent of the time when colossal installations for the throwing of water upon the land will be demanded. When that epoch arrives, as it assuredly will before the first half of the twentieth century has been nearly past, the pumping plants devoted to the purposes of irrigation will present as great a contrast to the lifting appliances of the East as does a fully loaded freight train or a mammoth steam cargo-slave to a coolie carrier. At the same time there must inevitably be a great extension of the useful purposes to which small motors can be applied in irrigation. Year by year the importance of the sprinkler, not only for ornamental grounds such as lawns and flower-beds, but also for the vegetable patch and the fruit garden, becomes more apparent, and efforts are being made towards the enlargement of the arms of sprinkling contrivances to such an extent as to enable them to throw a fine shower of water over a very large area of ground. Sometimes a windmill is used for pumping river or well-water into high tanks from which it descends by gravitation into the sprinklers, the latter being operated by the power of the liquid as it descends. This mode of working is convenient in many cases; but a more important, because a more widely applicable, method in the future will be that in which the wind-motor not only lifts the water, but scatters it around in the same operation. Long helical-shaped screws, horizontally fixed between uprights or set on a swivel on a single high tower, can be used for loading the breeze with a finely divided shower of water and thus projecting the moisture to very long distances. A windmill of the ordinary pattern, as used for gardens, may be fitted with a long perforated pipe, supported by wire guys instead of a vane, a connection being made by a water-tight swivel-joint between this pipe and that which carries the liquid from the pump. In this way every stroke of the machine sends innumerable jets of water out upon the wind, to be carried far afield. Gardening properties in comparatively dry climates, fitted with machines of this description, can be laid out in different zones of cultivation, determined according to the prevailing directions of the wind and the consequent distribution of the water supply. Thus if the wind most frequently blows from the west the plants which require the most water must be laid out at the eastern side, not too far from the sprinkler. Facilities for shutting off the supply of spray at will are, of course, very necessary. The system of watering founded on this principle depends upon the assumption that if the gardener or the farmer could always turn on the rain when he has a fairly good wind he would never lack for seasonable moisture to nourish his crops. This will be found in practice to apply correctly to the great majority of food plants. In the dry climates, which are so eminently healthy for cereals, 'the early and the latter rains,' as referred to in Scripture, are both needed, and one of the most important applications of cheap power will be directed to supplementing the natural supply either at one end or at the other. The 'tree-doctor' will be a personage of increasing importance in the rural economy of the twentieth century. He is already well in sight; but for lack of capital and of a due appreciation of the value of his services, he occupies as yet but a comparatively subordinate position. Fruits, which are nature's most elaborately worked-up edible products, must come more and more into favour as the complement to the seed food represented by bread. As the demand increases it will be more clearly seen that an enormous waste of labour is involved in the culture of an orchard unless its trees are kept in perfect health. At the same time the law of specialization must operate to set aside the tree-doctor to his separate duties, just as the physician and the veterinary surgeon already find their own distinctive spheres of work. The apparatus required for the thorough eradication of disease in fruit trees will be too expensive for the average grower to find any advantage in buying it for use only a few times during the year; but the tree-doctor, with his gangs of men, will be able to keep his special appliances at work nearly all the year round. For the destruction of almost all classes of fruit-pests, the only really complete method now in sight is the application of a poisonous gas, such as hydrocyanic acid, which is retained by means of a gas-proof tent pitched around each tree. No kind of a spray or wash can penetrate between bark and stem or into the cavities on fruit so well as a gaseous insecticide which permeates the whole of the air within the included space. But the gas-tight tent system of fumigation is as yet only in its infancy, and its growth and development will greatly help to place the fruit-growing industry on a new basis, and to bring the best kinds of fruit within the reach of the middle classes, the artisans, and ultimately even the very poor. Just as wheaten bread from being a luxury reserved for the rich has become the staple of food for all grades of society, so fruits which are now commonly regarded as an indulgence, although a very desirable addition to the food of the well-to-do, must, in a short time, become practically a necessity to the great mass of the people generally. The waste of effort and of wealth involved in planting trees and assiduously cultivating the soil for the growth of poor crops decimated by disease is the prime cause of the dearness of fruit. If, therefore, it be true that the fruit diet is one which is destined to greatly improve the average health of civilised mankind, it is obvious that the tree-doctor will act indirectly as the physician for human ailments.""","""Agricultural innovations and irrigation practices""","1973","""Agricultural practices have evolved significantly over the years, with innovations playing a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and sustainability. Among the most essential innovations in agriculture is the development of efficient irrigation practices. Irrigation is vital for providing water to crops, especially in regions where rainfall is insufficient or irregular. By ensuring a consistent water supply to crops, irrigation plays a key role in increasing agricultural productivity and food security.  One of the most significant advancements in irrigation practices is the shift from traditional flood irrigation to more efficient methods such as drip irrigation and sprinkler systems. Flood irrigation, although widely used in the past, is notorious for water wastage due to evaporation, runoff, and inefficient water distribution. In contrast, drip irrigation delivers water directly to the plant roots, minimizing losses and optimizing water use efficiency. This method not only conserves water but also reduces the risk of soil erosion and weed growth.  Similarly, sprinkler systems distribute water through pressurized pipes with sprinkler heads, mimicking natural rainfall. This method is effective in covering large areas and is well suited for crops requiring overhead watering. Modern sprinkler systems are equipped with technologies like weather sensors and timers to ensure precise and timely water application, further improving water efficiency.  Another innovative irrigation technique gaining popularity is center pivot irrigation. This method involves rotating sprinklers mounted on wheeled towers that pivot around a central point, irrigating circular fields. Center pivot systems are highly efficient, covering vast areas with minimal labor requirements. These systems can be equipped with precision technology to deliver the right amount of water to specific areas of the field, based on soil moisture levels and crop water requirements.  Furthermore, the integration of smart irrigation technologies and precision agriculture has revolutionized irrigation practices. Smart irrigation systems use sensors to monitor soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop water needs in real-time. This data is then analyzed to optimize irrigation scheduling, ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water at the right time. Precision agriculture techniques, such as GPS-guided equipment and drones, allow farmers to precisely apply water where and when it is needed, reducing water wastage and improving crop health.  In addition to technological innovations, sustainable irrigation practices are gaining importance in modern agriculture. Conservation tillage, cover cropping, and mulching help improve soil structure and water retention, reducing the need for frequent irrigation. Water-saving techniques like rainwater harvesting, drip fertigation (combining irrigation with fertilizer application), and using recycled water for irrigation are promoting water conservation in agriculture.  In conclusion, agricultural innovations in irrigation practices have significantly transformed modern farming by improving water efficiency, increasing crop yields, and promoting sustainable agriculture. By adopting advanced irrigation technologies and sustainable practices, farmers can overcome water scarcity challenges, mitigate environmental impacts, and ensure food security for a growing global population. Embracing these innovations is essential for the continued progress and resilience of the agricultural sector in the face of evolving climate conditions and resource constraints.""","580"
"Worthington A M  Arthur Mason ",""": The plates which I have mostly used have been Thomas's A ordinary. II THE OF A DROP--LOW FALL We will now turn to the photographic record itself. The first series shows the splash of a drop of water weighing of a gram, and therefore diameter, falling 0 cm. (about 6 inches) into milk mixed with water. The object of adding milk to the water was to make it more visible. The addition of milk makes, as we shall see, a little but not much difference in the general character of the splash. The scale of the figures is three-quarters of the actual size. The number written against any figure gives, on the assumption that no unobserved error has crept in, the time in decimal parts of a second that has elapsed since the stage marked 'T =,' which is nearest to the first instant of contact. The reader will understand from what has been said that the error in any of these times may be as much as two-thousandths of a second, but is not likely to be more than that, when all precautions were taken. It will be observed that as the drop descends into the liquid the upper portion is at first not appreciably distorted, but that a little cup or crater of liquid is thrown up round it. As the drop descends further, this crater grows wider and higher and thicker in the wall, and jets are shot out from its edge or rim. These jets are visible even in the second figure. The black marks on the inside wall of the crater are due to the lamp-black carried down with the drop from the smoked surface of the supporting cup: though in one sense a disfigurement, they serve to show by their presence that the interior of the crater is lined by the original liquid which formed the drop, and thus afford useful information as to the nature of the flow. The crater rises with great rapidity up to Fig.. In Fig. the walls are beginning to grow thicker, while the next three figures show the crater subsiding and widening, till in Fig. it lies as a mere ring of lobes on the surface, surrounding a central hollow. Fig. 0 shows the beginning of the rebound, in the rising of a central column. It will be seen that the lamp-black is now all swept to the middle, indicating that the liquid of the original drop emerges at the head of the central column. Full confirmation of this is obtained from Fig. 2, which represents the emergent column obtained when the circumstances are all the same, except that we have a drop of milk falling into water instead of water falling into milk. It will be observed that the upper part only of the column is visible, precisely because it contains nearly all the milk of the drop, while the lower part, consisting chiefly of transparent water, remains invisible. No. 5/8 shows the column at its greatest height, and it should be noticed that Figs. 6 and 7 show a tendency on the part of the head of this column to split off as a separate drop. The column in subsiding forms a 'cake' of liquid round the base. The edge of this circular the first well-marked ripple spreading outwards in an ever-widening circle. If Fig. 9 is reached without the top of the column having separated, then the splash follows the course shown in Figs. 0-a to 3-a, in which it will be observed that the disappearance of the first column is very quickly followed by the rise of a secondary column very different in shape, which itself subsides again, but has not, as it ultimately will, a second 'cake' on the top of the first. Thus the second ripple follows late after the first. If, however, the summit of the primary column succeeds in breaking. The photographs of show very beautifully the manner in which the advancing edge of the ripple degenerates into smaller ripples travelling with greater speed. It will be readily understood that if the splitting off of the head of the primary column happens to take place a little earlier, or on the other hand is nearly, but not quite, complete when it descends below the surface, then subsequent configurations will differ somewhat from either of the sub-series here shown. Since any figure photographed might belong to either sequence, the disentanglement of the two series required careful consideration and long experimenting. The reappearance of the original drop at the head of the rebounding column, of which the explanation has been given in this chapter, is easily verified by naked-eye observation. Let the reader when he next receives a cup of tea or coffee to which no milk has yet been added, make the simple experiment of dropping into it from a spoon, at the height of fifteen or sixteen inches above the surface, a single drop of milk. He will have no difficulty in recognizing that the column which emerges carries the white milk-drop at the top only slightly stained by the liquid into which it has fallen. In the same way naked-eye observation reveals the crater thrown up by the entry of a big rain-drop into a pool of water. In either case what we are able to glimpse is a 'stationary' stage. The rebounding column reaches a maximum height, remains poised for an instant, and then descends. The same is true of the crater. It is the relatively long duration of the moment of poise that produces on the eye a clear impression where all else is blurred by rapid change. But there is frequently a curious illusion. We often seem to see the crater with the column standing erect in the middle of it. We know now that in reality the crater has vanished before the column appears. But the image of the crater has not time to fade before that of the column is superposed on it. Those who are accustomed 'to believe nothing that they hear and only half of what they see' may be glad to find at least the latter part of their maxim so completely justified. III The reader's attention has now been directed to various features which, with certain modifications, will be found in many of the splashes that we shall examine; but so far the language used has been simply descriptive and in no way explanatory. Instead of going on to describe other splashes in the same way, and thus to accumulate a great mass of uncoordinated descriptive detail, it will be better to pause for a moment in order to become acquainted with certain principles connected with the behaviour of liquids, the application of which will go a long way towards explaining what we see going on in any splash. The first principle to be understood is that the surface layers of any liquid behave like a uniformly stretched skin or membrane, which is always endeavouring to contract and to diminish its area. If the surface is flat, like the surface of still liquid in a bowl, this surface-tension has only the effect of exerting a small inward pull on the walls of the bowl. But if the surface is curved, with a convexity outwards, then the surface layers, on account of their tension, press the interior liquid back, and thus tend to check the growth of any protuberance; while, on the other hand, if the surface is concave outwards, then the surface-tension tends to pull the interior liquid forward, and so to diminish the concavity. Direct evidence of this surface-tension is easy to cite. We have it in any pendent drop, such as any of those shown in the accompanying figures. If we ask ourselves how it is that the liquid in the interior of one of these drops does not flow out, pressed as it is by the liquid above it, the answer is that everywhere the stretched skin presses it back. A soap-bubble too presses on the air in its interior, both the outside layers and the inside layers of the thin film being curved over the interior space. This is the reason that a soap-bubble blown on the bowl of a pipe will slowly collapse again if we remove the stem of the pipe from our mouth. The bubble drives the interior air back through the pipe. And it is easy to show that if two soap-bubbles be blown on the ends of two tubes which can be connected together by opening a tap between them, then the smaller will collapse and blow out the larger. The reason of this is that in the bubble of smaller radius the surface layers are more sharply curved, and therefore exert a greater pressure on the air within.""","""Dynamics of liquid splashes""","1706","""Liquid splashes are dynamic events that occur when a liquid is suddenly disrupted or subjected to an external force, causing it to break into droplets and spread outwards. The dynamics of liquid splashes encompass a complex interplay of forces and phenomena, involving factors such as surface tension, viscosity, impact velocity, and surface properties. Understanding the intricacies of liquid splashes is crucial across various fields, including physics, engineering, biology, and even in everyday scenarios like cooking or cleaning. In this article, we will delve into the fascinating world of liquid splashes, exploring the underlying principles, key factors influencing splash dynamics, and real-world applications.  At the core of liquid splashes lies the concept of surface tension, which is the tendency of a liquid's surface to minimize its surface area. When a droplet impacts a surface, the energy from the impact overcomes the cohesive forces within the liquid, leading to the formation of a splash. The formation of liquid splashes can vary significantly depending on the properties of the liquid and the surface it impacts. For instance, a highly viscous liquid like honey will exhibit different splash dynamics compared to a low-viscosity liquid like water due to the differing deformability and resistance to flow.  The impact velocity of the liquid droplet plays a crucial role in determining the dynamics of the resulting splash. Higher impact velocities typically result in more energetic splashes with larger droplets and greater spreading. The angle at which the droplet strikes the surface also influences the splash pattern, with shallow angles often leading to more extensive splashing compared to perpendicular impacts. Additionally, the surface properties of the impacting surface, such as roughness or hydrophobicity, can significantly affect splash behavior by influencing the contact time and spreading of the liquid.  The dynamics of liquid splashes have been extensively studied through experimental observations, numerical simulations, and theoretical models. High-speed imaging techniques have been instrumental in capturing the rapid dynamics of liquid splashes with microsecond resolution, allowing researchers to analyze the formation and evolution of splashes in detail. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have also been employed to model the intricate fluid dynamics involved in splash events, providing valuable insights into the underlying physics.  One of the key phenomena observed in liquid splashes is the formation of secondary droplets through the fragmentation of the primary droplet upon impact. This secondary droplet generation is influenced by factors such as surface roughness, viscosity, and the presence of air pockets within the liquid. The size distribution and trajectory of the secondary droplets can have implications in various applications, including inkjet printing, pesticide spraying, and medical aerosols.  Liquid splashes find applications across a wide range of industries and disciplines. In the field of biomedical engineering, understanding the dynamics of blood splashes during surgical procedures is crucial for minimizing the risk of contamination and infection. In agriculture, the study of liquid splashes is essential for optimizing pesticide spraying techniques to ensure uniform coverage and minimize environmental impact. Similarly, in the field of additive manufacturing, controlling the dynamics of liquid metal splashes during printing processes is key to achieving high-quality and defect-free products.  In conclusion, the dynamics of liquid splashes represent a fascinating and intricate area of study with broad implications across diverse fields. By unraveling the underlying principles governing splash events and investigating the key factors influencing splash dynamics, researchers and engineers can pave the way for enhanced technologies, improved processes, and innovative applications. Whether in fundamental research or practical applications, the study of liquid splashes offers a rich tapestry of challenges and opportunities for exploration and discovery.""","708"
"Bovallius Carl","""The carvings found on its south-western spur, Punta de Pantheon, cut in the solid rock at a depth of two meters below the lowest surface of the lake, prove that the island has sunk at a late period, and thus corroborate my hypothesis of the earlier connection between Ceiba and Zapatera. This connection has been dissolved by the gradual sinking of the volcano. The western portion of the island is plain, partly cultivated, partly covered by bush, the eastern is very rugged. Cerro de Pantheon, its highest point, is about 0 meters above the surface of the lake. This mountain ridge is 0 to 00 meters in length by 0 to 5/8 in breadth, and offers an extraordinarily well-fit place for rock-carvings. And, indeed, the ancient inhabitants of the island have made such an eager use of this opportunity that the whole crown of the ridge is densely covered with sculptures. This crown, as has been mentioned before, forms a perfectly level surface; indeed, it is not quite impossible that human hands may have helped nature to level it. On the part of the mountain chiefly occupied by the rock-carvings, the vegetation was very scanty, consisting of low shrubs and stiff grass. I could not detect any carvings on the different sides of the mountain, nor on the large loose blocks of stone north of Cerro de Pantheon. But on large flat or round blocks, detached long ago from the side of the mountain, and lying all the way down to the southern shore at Punta de Pantheon, numerous carvings were found. Such were also to be seen there in the solid rock as well on land as on that part of the rock that stretches into the lake. I can here give illustrations only of the lesser part of the carvings. The wreaths were generally even, boldly cut, - cm. broad, - cm. deep. a Pl. 7. It represented the upper part of a human figure. The face was broad, with round eyes, broad nose, and square mouth. The head was surmounted by four plumes, meant, according to the conception of my Indians, to represent a crown of feathers. On this account, they honoured the figure with the name of La Reyna. The chest was short and broad, the arms very long, the hands circular, the left one much larger than the right one, both provided with eight radiating fingers. The length of the figure from the crown of the head to the lower edge of the breast was 4 cm.; the breadth between the elbows 27 cm. b Pl. 7. It may possibly have been intended to represent a very primitive human figure. The face was formed by two concentric circles; the eyes and the mouth were represented by three small shallow cavities. On the head there was a kind of head-ornament, broader upwards, or possibly the face of an animal, also marked with three cavities. The body was a rectangular enlargement without arms, with a straight furrow in its middle; from its lower edge there issued one long, straight leg, ending in a short foot, broadening outwards. The entire length of the figure was 2 cm.; the breadth of the face was 6 cm. c Pl. 7. This was possibly also meant to be a human figure, though the legs were wanting. The face was a broad oval, with three holes situated more to the right, representing the eyes and the mouth. On the head was a little, tiara-shaped ornament. The arms were short, without any traces of hands. The whole length was 0 cm., the breadth of the face was 0 cm. d Pl. 7. Human figure with arms and one leg. The face was nearly triangular with rounded corners. Three holes represented the eyes and the mouth. On the head was a high ornament, like that of the preceding figure.

A spirally wound line running out into some irregular curves, the last part quite straight. The diameter of the spiral was 0 cm. f Pl. 8. A human figure; the face in profile, high and narrow, with pointed nose and thick, round chin. The eye was a pretty large, oval cavity. Above the head were three plumes, broadening towards the end. Opposite to the face was placed a figure possibly meant to represent the head of an animal, its eye marked by an oval cavity. The neck of the human figure was represented by a rectangle; the body appeared in profile, the breast was convex, the back slightly concave. The arms and legs were represented en face, the left arm in two parts, the right one in one; the left hand with two fingers, the right one with six. The legs were short, curved; the feet indicated by two ovals. Between the legs a second face was sculptured; the eyes were two small cavities, the nose was a long furrow broader downwards, the mouth a furrow broader in the middle. The length of the figure from the top of the head to the lower edge of the foot was 61 cm.; the breadth across the shoulders 5/8 cm. g Pl. 8. A monkey in profile; the head circular without any traces of eye or nose; the body convex before, straight behind; the arm raised, with three-fingered hand, the tail projecting at a right angle, its end spirally wound; the leg bent, with two feet, and the sexual organ behind. The length from the top of the head to the lower foot was 0 cm. h Pl. 8.

"Arrhenius Svante","""Probably it was mainly gathered in by the Sun, where a velocity of 13 km. (80 miles) per second is necessary if the molecules are to overcome the Suns attraction, while their actual velocity there amounts to only about km. ( miles) per second. In a similar manner we find that the second lightest gas, helium, at a temperature of 5/80 C. (00 F.), possesses a molecular velocity of.2 km. (. miles) per second. This is less than the km. (.4 miles) per second necessary to leave the Moons sphere of attraction. But all helium molecules do not move at the same speed; some are faster and some slower than the average. Those moving at a higher rate than km. (.4 miles) per second constitute a considerable fraction of the total. This fraction disappears. Equilibrium is soon restored so that in less than a second the same fraction of helium molecules is ready to depart. In this manner the Moon lost its helium atmosphere speedily, although not quite as rapidly as its hydrogen. More slowly yet vanished the gases which are most abundant in our atmosphere, nitrogen and oxygen, but these too were not fettered for ever by the limited gravity on the Moon. The same fate befell aqueous vapour, which is nearly twice as light as oxygen. The loss of water, however, was long delayed, as we later shall learn, because new vapour masses were discharged from the lunar volcanoes. In these considerations, we should also bear in mind that the Moon no doubt was a fluid molten mass when separating from the Earth and its substance resembled the lava from our volcanoes. In this condition it remained until its exterior temperature had fallen to about 200 C. (200 F.). At that point, the average velocity of oxygen molecules is about km. (.2 mile) per second, with variations in both directions, so that a few per cent. of them reach a sufficient velocity to leave the Moon for ever. Such gas molecules of medium weight return probably to the Earth which, as experience tells us, is ponderous enough to hold them in bonds. All gases, that constitute any considerable fraction of the Earths atmosphere, and which, therefore, most likely were divided with the Moon in its parting from us, have again left that globe. The same unquestionably holds true for other stellar bodies of equal or smaller size, such as all the minor planets and for the great majority of the satellites to the major ones. Only the very largest of Jupiters moons, and possibly Neptunes lonely companion, whose size is not known with certainty, might possibly surpass our Moon in ability to retain gases. Our reasoning with respect to the Moon applies also to Mercury. It is true that the molecules there must possess a velocity one and a half times as high as on the Moon if they are to leave the planet. But at the same time the temperature on Mercurys hottest point, always turned toward the Sun, is far higher, about 00 C. (5/80 F.), so that the molecules there move.6 times as fast as similar molecules over the Moons hottest point. Mercury is consequently better able than the Moon to retain gases, but the difference is slight. Direct lead us to believe that Mercury is very similar to the Moon in these respects. We might possibly imagine that certain gases, which on the Moon would condense into fluids or solids, on Mercury might remain volatilized on account of the high temperature and thus form an atmosphere. Such assumption, however, would be erroneous. The investigations by Schiaparelli and by all his successors show that Mercury in turning around its axis always presents the selfsame side to the Sun. The opposite side, never reached by a ray of sunlight, must assume an extremely low temperature, very close to the absolute far below any cold existing on the Moon. To this side, all bodies with an appreciable vapour pressure must distil and freeze to solid lumps or frost-coverings without perceptible vapour pressure. For these reasons, Mercury cannot possess any atmosphere to speak of. There remain in the whole series of planets and satellites in our solar system only two bodies besides the Earth which are endowed with an atmosphere in the original sense of the word--namely, Mars and Venus. We reach the same conclusion when investigating the ability of the planets to reflect the sunlight falling upon them. The bodies which possess an atmosphere hold also suspended therein clouds of water or ice, and also of dust, whirled up from below. These floating particles reflect light far more efficiently than the solid or fluid surface of a planet. The Moon can now reflect. per cent. of the sunlight and Mercury. per cent. (H. N. Russell, Proceedings Nat. Acad., 916). These numbers lie so close that they may be considered practically the same within errors of observation. It is therefore probable that Mercury is as devoid of an atmosphere as the Moon. The opposite extreme is represented by Venus, which reflects not less than 9 per cent. of the sunlight received, according to H. N. Russell. Terrestrial clouds were found by Abbot to return 5/8 per cent. We believe from astronomical observations that the entire surface of Venus is hidden behind a thick opaque cloud-covering. The slight difference between O.5/8 and O.9 may be due to errors of observation, but also to a small absorption of light in those parts of Venuss atmosphere which are outside of the clouds. Saturn and Jupiter are very similar to Venus in this regard with 3 and 6 per cent. respectively. The gases above the clouds on these planets extinguish to a considerable extent the sunlight reflected from the clouds, as apparent from their spectra. (Compare Fig. 3.) Hence the value.3 given by Russell for Saturn is probably too high. Concerning Jupiter it has been observed that its red light becomes deeper when the sunspots are few, but whiter when the spots are numerous. The sunspots have been found to favour the formation of high clouds, such as cirrus, and this would seem to apply also to Jupiter; when spots are plenty, the clouds are high, and consequently the absorbing layers above, which cause the red colour, are thinner, so that Jupiter will then shine with a whiter--less red--lustre than when the sunspots are rare. The two outmost planets, Uranus and Neptune, return, according to Russell, 3 and 3 per cent. respectively of the sunlight received. These figures are probably too high. They do not agree well with Sliphers records of their 5/8. Thus the clouds alone return.5/8 =.38 parts of the sunlight. Of this portion a fraction amounting to about per cent. is extinguished in the air above. The remainder is.25/8. Atmosphere and suspended dust reduce the sunlight over the cloud-free part, i. e. 8 per cent. of the Earth, by 0 per cent, half of which returns to space, while the other half reaches the ground in the form of light from the sky, and of this fraction again about per cent. is reflected into space; these two items added give.5/8. Finally, the 0 per cent. sunlight directly received by the Earths surface is reflected to the extent of per cent. by the oceans and by the generally moist ground; deserts and bare rocks reflect about twice as much, but their total area is comparatively small; of this per cent. reflected light, 0 per cent. reaches outside space; thus we obtain.0 =.08. In all, therefore, the amount of reflected sunlight is.38.5/8.08 = 9. per cent. If the air were free from clouds, the reflexion-number or Albedo would be 3 per cent., or considerably higher than that of Mars. When now half or a little the Earths surface is overcast with clouds and this portion therefore has the whiteness of Venus, the figure 9. the entire Earth naturally falls closer--almost. times--to 9, the figure of Venus, than to 5/8., the figure for Mars. We may also compare the value 3 per cent., which applies to the cloud-free portion of the Earth, with the value 5/8. per cent. for Mars, which is almost without clouds, and with the value. per cent. for the Moon, which has neither clouds nor dust, because it lacks an atmosphere. We can then conclude that the atmosphere of our Earth holds almost three times as much dust suspended over each square metre as does Mars, and this in spite of the smaller gravitational force on Mars, which is about 7. per cent. of that on Earth. Taking proper account of the low temperature on Mars we may easily compute, by means of a formula given by Stokes, that a particle of dust should sink. times slower on Mars than on Earth. When, nevertheless and in spite of frequent but thin mists, so few particles of dust float in the atmosphere of Mars, the conception inevitably comes to our mind that the air on that planet must be extremely rarefied so that the wind-puffs have little power to raise the dust from the ground. Lowell estimated the barometric pressure at the surface of Mars to be about 4 mm. (.2 inches), and Proctor gives about twice this figure.""","""Loss of atmospheres on celestial bodies.""","1927","""Loss of atmospheres on celestial bodies is a fascinating aspect of planetary science that sheds light on the evolution and sustainability of different worlds in our universe. From Earth to Mars and beyond, understanding how atmospheres can be lost or transformed over time is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of our solar system and beyond.  One of the key factors influencing the loss of atmospheres is the interaction between a celestial body's atmospheric gases and external factors such as solar radiation and the presence of a magnetic field. These interactions play a significant role in determining the fate of an atmosphere. For instance, Earth's magnetic field helps protect our atmosphere from the solar wind—a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun. Without this protective shield, Earth's atmosphere would have been vulnerable to erosion by the solar wind, leading to the gradual loss of gases into space.  On Mars, the situation is quite different. Despite having a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, the Red Planet lacks a global magnetic field like Earth's. This allows the solar wind to directly interact with Mars' atmosphere, leading to ongoing atmospheric escape. Over millions of years, Mars has likely lost a significant portion of its original atmosphere, transforming the planet into the cold, dry world we observe today. Understanding this process of atmospheric loss on Mars provides valuable insights into the planet's past climatic conditions and potential for habitability.  Venus, on the other hand, presents a unique case of atmospheric retention despite its proximity to the Sun. With an incredibly thick and dense atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide, Venus experiences a runaway greenhouse effect that traps heat and maintains its scorching surface temperatures. While Venus has retained its atmosphere, the extreme conditions on the planet serve as a cautionary example of the consequences of unchecked greenhouse gas accumulation.  In the outer solar system, gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn boast massive atmospheres primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. These planets exhibit dynamic processes such as powerful storms and intricate cloud patterns driven by internal heat and atmospheric dynamics. However, even these giants are not immune to atmospheric losses. For example, Jupiter's moon Io experiences volcanic activity that releases sulfur dioxide into space, contributing to an extended exosphere around the moon.  Beyond our solar system, exoplanets offer a wealth of information on the diversity of atmospheric processes. Scientists study the atmospheres of these distant worlds using techniques like transit spectroscopy, which analyzes the absorption of light as a planet passes in front of its host star. By studying the composition and behavior of exoplanet atmospheres, researchers can infer conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of key molecules like water vapor or methane.  Loss of atmospheres on celestial bodies is not limited to natural processes alone. Human activities on Earth have also had a significant impact on our atmosphere through activities such as deforestation, industrial emissions, and the release of greenhouse gases. The consequences of these actions, including climate change and environmental degradation, highlight the delicate balance that exists within Earth's atmosphere and the need for sustainable practices to protect our planet's air quality.  In conclusion, the study of atmospheric loss on celestial bodies provides valuable insights into planetary evolution, habitability, and the broader context of our place in the universe. By unraveling the mechanisms behind atmospheric escape and transformation, scientists continue to deepen our understanding of the complex interactions between celestial bodies and their atmospheres. As we explore the mysteries of the cosmos, each revelation about atmospheric processes brings us closer to unlocking the secrets of our solar system and beyond.""","693"
"Jones Rufus M  Rufus Matthew ","""That we are oppressed with our own littleness, that we revolt from our meannesses, that we look before and after, and sigh for what is not, that we are never satisfied with any achievement, that each attainment inaugurates a new drive, that we feel the glory of the imperfect, means that in some way we partake of an infinite revealed in us by an inherent necessity of self-consciousness. We are made for something which does not yet appear, we are inalienably kin to the perfect that always draws and attracts us. We are forever seeking God because, in some sense, however fragmentary, we have found Him. Here sits he shaping wings to fly; His heart forbodes a mystery: He names the name Eternity. That type of Perfect in his mind In Nature can he nowhere find. He sows himself on every wind. He seems to hear a heavenly Friend, And through thick veils to apprehend A labor working to an end. The most august thing in us is that creative center of our being, that autonomous citadel of personality, where we form for ourselves ideals of beauty, of truth, and of goodness by which we live. This power to extend life in ideal fashion is the elemental moral fact of personal life. These ideals which shape our life are manifestly things which cannot be found anywhere in our world of sense experience. They are not on land or sea. We live, and, when the call for it comes, we joyously die for things which our eyes have never seen in this world of molecular currents, for things which are not here in the world of space, but which are not on that account any less real. We create, by some higher drive of spirit, visions of a world that ought to be and these visions make us forever dissatisfied with the world that is, and it is through these visions that we reshape and reconstruct the world which is being made. The elemental spiritual core in us which we call conscience can have come from nowhere but from a deeper spiritual universe with which we have relations. It cannot be traced to any physical origin. It cannot be reduced to any biological function. It cannot be explained in utilitarian terms. It is an august and authoritative loyalty of soul to a Good that transcends all goods and which will not allow us to substitute prudence for intrinsic goodness. This inner imperative overarches our moral life, and it rationally presupposes a spiritual universe with which we are allied. There is, too, an immense interior depth to our human personality. Only the surface of our inner self is lighted up and is brought into clear focal consciousness. There are, however, dim depths underlying every moment of consciousness and these subterranean deeps are all the time shaping or determining the ideas, emotions, and decisions which surge up into the illuminated apex of consciousness. This submerged life is in part, no doubt, the slow deposit of previous experiences, the gathered wisdom of the social group in which we are imbedded, the residual savings from unuttered hopes and wishes, aspirations and intentions, All I could never be, All, men ignored in me. But at times our interior deep seems to be more than a deposit of the past. Incursions from beyond our own margin seem to occur. Inrushes from a wider spiritual world seem to take place. Vitalizing, energizing, constructive forces come from somewhere into men, as though another universe impinged upon our finite spirits. We cannot prove by these somewhat rare and unusual mystical openings that there is an actual spiritual environment surrounding our souls, but there are certainly experiences which are best explained on that hypothesis, and there is no good reason for drawing any impervious boundary around the margins of the spiritual self within us. All attempts to reduce mans inner spiritual life to the play of molecular forces have fallen through. Correlation between mind and brain cortex there certainly is and spirit, as we know it, expresses itself under, or in relation to, certain physical conditions. But it is impossible to establish a complete parallelism between mind-functions and brain-functions. The psychical, that is to say spirit, seems immensely to outrun its organ and to use brain as a musician uses an instrument. The psychological studies of Henri Bergson in France and of Dr. William McDougall at Oxford make a very strong argument for the view that the higher forms of consciousness cannot be explained in terms of brain action and that there is no well-defined physical correlate to the highest and most central psychical processes. I shall follow in the main the positions of my old teacher, Dr. McDougall, as worked out in his Body and Mind. One of the most important differences between human and animal consciousness comes to light in the appearance of meaning which is a differentiating characteristic of personal consciousness. We pass a great divide when we pass from bare sensory experience, common to all higher animals, to consciousness of meaning, which is a trait common only to persons. We all know what it is to hear words which make a clear impression and which yet arouse no meaning. We often gaze at objects and yet, like Macbeth, have no speculation in our eyes we apprehend no significant meaning in the thing upon which we are looking. We sometimes catch ourselves in the very act of passing from mere sense or bare image to the higher level of meaning. While we gaze or while we listen we suddenly feel the meaning flood in and transform the whole content of consciousness. All the higher ranges of experience depend on this unique feature which is something over and above the mere sensory stage. The words, the quality of mercy is not straind remain just word-sounds until in a flash one sees that mercy is not something that comes out grudgingly in drops, and then the mind rises to a consciousness of meaning. In this higher experience, meaning stands vividly in the focus of consciousness and, in a case, for instance, of grasping a long sentence, or of appreciating a piece of music, consciousness of meaning is an integral unitary whole. Now there is no corresponding unitary whole in the brain which could stand as the physical correlate to this consciousness of meaning. The simple sensational experiences correspond in some way to parallel brain processes but these elemental experiences are merely cues which evoke higher forms of psychical meaning, that have no physical or mechanical correlate in the brain. This is still more strikingly the case in the higher forms of memory. The lower and more mechanical forms of memory may be treated as a habit-sequence, linked up with permanent brain paths. But memory proper depends, as does meaning, upon a single act of mental apprehension. As McDougall well says: the whole process and effect, the apprehension and the retention and the remembering, are absolutely unique and distinct from all other apprehensions and retentions and rememberings. The higher kind of memory involves meaning and, the moment meaning floods in, vast and complicated wholes of experience tend to become a permanent possession, while only with multitudinous repetitions can we fix and keep processes that are meaningless and without psychical significance. But here once more this higher unitary consciousness of a remembered whole of experience has no assignable physical correlate in the brain-processes. Certain sensory cues evoke or recall a synthetic whole of consciousness which has no parallel in the material world. Still more obviously in the higher sthetic sentiments and volitional processes is there a spiritual activity which transcends the mechanical and physical order. sthetic joy depends upon a spiritual power to combine many elements of experience to form an object of a higher order than any object given to sense. It is particularly true of the highest sthetic joy, for example, enjoyment of poetic creations where the ideal and intellectual element vastly overtops the sensuous, and where the words and imagery really carry the reader on into another world than the one of sight and sound. Here in a very high degree we attain a unified whole of consciousness that has no physical correlate among the brain-processes. It is further apparent that the higher forms of pleasure somehow exert an effective influence upon the physical system itself as though some new and heightening energy poured back from consciousness into the cerebral processes and drained down through the system. William James has given a very successful account of the way in which pleasure and pain as spiritual energies reinforce or damp the physical activities, so that the personal soul seems to take a unique part from within in determining the physical process. Here are his words: Tremendous as the part is which pleasure and pain play in our psychic life, we must confess that absolutely nothing is known of their cerebral conditions. It is hard to imagine them as having special centres; it is harder still to invent peculiar forms of process in each and every centre, to which these feelings may be due. And let one try as one will to represent the cerebral activity in exclusively mechanical terms, I, for one, find it quite impossible to enumerate what seem to be the facts and yet to make no mention of the psychic side which they possess. However it be with other drainage currents and discharges, the drainage currents and discharges of the brain are not purely physical facts. They are psycho-physical facts, and the spiritual quality of them seems a codeterminant of their mechanical effectiveness. If the mechanical activities in a cell, as they increase, give pleasure, they seem to increase all the more rapidly for that fact; if they give displeasure, the displeasure seems to damp the activities.""","""The nature of human consciousness.""","1909","""Human consciousness is a profound and complex subject that has captivated philosophers, scientists, and thinkers throughout history. It represents the essence of our being, encompassing our thoughts, perceptions, emotions, and self-awareness. Understanding the nature of human consciousness involves delving into the intricate workings of the brain and exploring questions about the mind-body relationship, the origin of consciousness, and the subjective experience of reality.  At the heart of the debate surrounding consciousness is the """"hard problem"""" as coined by philosopher David Chalmers. This problem refers to the mysterious and subjective nature of consciousness that resists easy explanation. While science has made significant strides in unraveling the workings of the brain, the question of how neural processes give rise to our rich inner world of thoughts and feelings remains a puzzle.  One key aspect of human consciousness is self-awareness. This capacity to reflect on ourselves, our experiences, and our thoughts is believed to be a unique feature of human cognition. Self-awareness not only allows us to perceive the world around us but also to introspect and contemplate our own existence. This ability forms the basis of our sense of identity and plays a crucial role in shaping our beliefs, desires, and actions.  Consciousness is also closely tied to our perceptions and experiences. Our sensory organs – such as sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell – enable us to interact with our environment and gather information about the external world. These sensory inputs are processed by the brain, giving rise to our conscious experience of reality. Perception involves complex cognitive processes that go beyond mere sensory input, as our beliefs, memories, and expectations influence how we interpret and make sense of the world around us.  Emotions are another integral component of human consciousness. From joy to sorrow, love to anger, emotions color our subjective experience and shape our interactions with others. The brain regions involved in emotional processing are deeply interconnected with those responsible for higher cognitive functions, highlighting the intimate relationship between rational thought and emotional responses. Emotions play a fundamental role in decision-making, social bonding, and overall well-being, underscoring their importance in shaping our conscious experience.  The question of free will is a contentious issue in discussions about consciousness. The concept of free will – the idea that individuals have the capacity to make choices that are not determined by external factors – raises profound philosophical and ethical implications. Some argue that our sense of agency and the ability to make decisions reflect the operation of our conscious minds, while others suggest that our actions are ultimately determined by underlying neural processes and environmental influences.  Recent advances in neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence have shed light on the mechanisms underlying consciousness. Studies using brain imaging techniques have identified neural correlates of consciousness, linking specific brain activity patterns to conscious experiences. While these findings provide valuable insights into the neural basis of consciousness, the exact relationship between brain activity and subjective experience remains a topic of ongoing research and debate.  One prominent theory in the study of consciousness is Integrated Information Theory (IIT), proposed by Giulio Tononi. According to IIT, consciousness arises from the integrated functioning of multiple brain regions, where information is processed in a unified and coherent manner. This theory emphasizes the interconnectedness of neural networks and the generation of complex patterns of information that give rise to conscious experience.  The phenomenon of altered states of consciousness further highlights the remarkable flexibility and variability of human consciousness. States such as dreaming, meditation, psychedelic experiences, and near-death experiences offer intriguing glimpses into the diverse manifestations of consciousness. These altered states challenge our conventional understanding of reality and raise profound questions about the nature of perception, selfhood, and the boundaries of consciousness.  Exploring the nature of human consciousness also involves considering cultural, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives on the mind. Various philosophical traditions, such as Buddhism and phenomenology, offer unique insights into the nature of consciousness, self-awareness, and reality. These perspectives emphasize the importance of subjective experience, introspection, and mindfulness in understanding the complexities of human consciousness.  In conclusion, human consciousness is an enigmatic and multifaceted phenomenon that lies at the core of our existence. It encompasses our thoughts, perceptions, emotions, and self-awareness, shaping our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Despite centuries of philosophical inquiry and scientific investigation, the nature of consciousness remains a profound mystery, inviting further exploration and contemplation. Understanding the intricate workings of consciousness not only deepens our insight into the human mind but also raises profound questions about the nature of reality, perception, and the essence of being.""","902"
"Coffin Henry Sloane","""The Church exists to make the world the Kingdom of God. In the holy city of John's vision there is no temple, for its whole life is radiant with the presence of God and of the Lamb. In the final order there will be no Church, for its task is finished when God is all in all. Meanwhile the Church has no excuse for being except as it continually renders itself less and less necessary. It has to lose itself in sacrificial service in order to save itself. It must never ask itself, 'Will the community support me?' but 'Can I inspire the community?' As it seeks to do God's will, it can count on Him for daily bread; a more luxurious diet would not be wholesome for its spiritual life. It exists only to spend and be spent in bringing the children of God everywhere one by one under the sway of His love and presenting them perfect in Christ, and in putting His Spirit in control of homes, industry, amusements, education, government, and the whole life of human society, until we live in 'realms where the air we breathe is love.' VIII THE LIFE Various factors combine to make it hard for men today to believe vividly in life beyond the grave. Our science has emphasized the closeness of the connection between our spiritual life and our bodies. If there be an abnormal pressure upon some part of the brain, we lose our minds; an operation upon a man's skull may transform him from a criminal into a reputable member of society. It is not easy for us to conceive how life can continue after the body dies. Diderot put the difficulty more than a century ago: 'If you can believe in sight without eyes, in hearing without ears, in thinking without a head, if you could love without a heart, feel without senses, exist when you are nowhere and be something without extension, then we might indulge this hope of a future life.' Our modern view of the universe no longer leaves us a localized heaven and hell, and we have not the lively imaginations of those older generations to whom the unseen world was as real as the streets they walked and the houses in which they lived. One goes into such a burying place as the Campo Santo at Pisa, or reads Dante's Divina Comedia, and the painters who adorned the walls with frescoes depicting the future abodes of the blessed and the damned, and the poet who actually travelled in thought through Hell and Purgatory and Paradise, were as keenly aware of these places as of neighboring Italian towns. We lack a definite neighborhood in which to locate the lives that pass from our sight. Religious authority is based, today, upon experience, and obviously experience can give no certain knowledge of things future. We are disposed to treat all pictures of the life to come, whether in the Bible or out of it, as the projections of men's hopes. They are such stuff as dreams are made on. And at present we are absorbingly interested in the advance of our world's life; we dream of better cities here, rather than of some golden city beyond our horizon; we care far more intensely for lasting earth-wide peace that shall render impossible such awful orgies of death as this present war, than for the peace of a land that lieth afar. Men think of the immortality of their influence, rather than of what they themselves will be doing five hundred years hence, and of the social order that shall prevail in the earth in the year 000, rather than of the social order of the celestial country. Immortality is not so much disbelieved, as unthought of. But death is always man's contemporary; and no year goes by for any of us without regretted partings. And if we stop to think of it, we are all of us under sentence, indefinitely reprieved, if you will, but with no more than an interval between ourselves and the tomb. To every thoughtful person the question is forced home, 'If a man die, shall he live again?' What did Jesus Christ contribute towards answering our question? He made everlasting life much more necessary to His followers than to the rest of men. By bringing life to light and showing us how infinitely rich it is, He kindled in us the passion for the second life, and rendered immortality indispensable for Christians. Christ enhances every man's worth in his own eyes. We find that we mean so much to Him and to His God and Father, that we come to mean infinitely more to ourselves. 'If,' writes a modern essayist, 'a man feels that his life is spent in expedients for killing time, he finds it hard to suppose that he can go on forever trying to kill eternity. It is when he thinks on the littleness that makes up his day, on the poor trifles he cares for--his pipe, his dinner, his ease, his gains, his newspaper--that he feels so cramped and cribbed, cabined and confined, that he loses the power of conceiving anything vast or sublime--immortality among the rest. When a man rises in his aims and looks at the weal of the universe, and the harmony of the soul with God, then we feel that extinction would be grievous.' And it is just this uplift into a new outlook that men find in Jesus Christ. A Second Century Christian, writing to his friend, Diognetus, characterizes Christianity as 'this new interest which has entered into life.' We look upon each day with a fresh expectancy; we view ourselves with a new reverence. The waste wilderness within, from which we despaired of producing anything, must under Christ's recreating touch become an Eden, where we feel Pison and Euphrates roll Round the great garden of a kingly soul. But is this emparadised life to be some day thrown aside? G.J. Romanes, whose Christian upbringing had instilled in him the distinctively Christian appreciation of the value of his own life, when his scientific opinions robbed him of the hope of immortality, wrote: 'Although from henceforth the precept 'to work while it is day' will doubtless but gain an intensified force from the terribly intensified meaning of the words that 'the night cometh when no man can work,' yet when at times I think, as think at times I must, of the appalling contrast between the hallowed glory of that creed which once was mine, and the lonely mystery of existence as I now find it, at such times I shall ever feel it impossible to avoid the sharpest pang of which my instinct is susceptible.' And Jesus increases the significance of people for each other. He possessed and conveys the genius for appreciation. He came that life might become more abundant, and every human relation deeper, tenderer, richer. It is to love that death is intolerable. Professor Palmer of Harvard, a few years ago, delivered a lecture upon Intimations of Immortality in the Sonnets of Shakespere, in which he showed that, when a man finds himself truly in love, mortality becomes unthinkable to him. And for Christians love and friendship contain more than they do for other men. Christ takes us more completely out of ourselves and wraps us up in those to whom we feel ourselves bound. He makes life touch life at more points, life draw from life more copious inspirations, life cling to life with more affectionate tenacity. He roots and grounds us in love, and that is to root us in the souls of other men; then to tear them from us irrevocably--parents, children, husband, wife, lover, beloved, friend,--is to leave us of all men most pitiable. Love--the prisoned God in man-- Shows his face glorious, shakes his banner free, Cries like a captain for eternity. Again, Christ gives men an ideal for themselves which in their threescore years and ten, more or less, they cannot hope to achieve: 'Be ye perfect as your Father.' Jesus Himself, in whom we see the Father, is for us that which we feel we must be, yet which we never are. Immortality becomes a necessity to any man who seriously sets himself to become like Jesus. Our mistakes and follies, the false starts we make, the tasks we attempt for which we discover ourselves unfit, the waste of time and energy we cannot repair, the tangled snarls into which we wind ourselves and which require years to straighten out, render this life absurd, if it be final. It cannot be more than a series of tentative beginnings, and if there be no continuation, the scheme of things is a gigantic blunder. If Jesus does no more than supply us with an ideal hopelessly beyond our attainment and inspire us irresistibly to set out on its quest, He is no Saviour but a Tormentor. The fiend that man harries Is love of the best. We are doomed to a few score years of tantalizing failure, and victory is forever impossible for sheer want of time. Further, Jesus gives men a vision of a new social order--the Kingdom of God--a vision so alluring that, once seen, they cannot but live for its accomplishment. We are fascinated with the prospect of a world where hideous war is unthinkable; where none waste and none want, for brotherhood governs industry and commerce; where nations are animated by a ministering patriotism; and where every contact of life with life is redemptive. But the more fervently we long for this golden age, the more heartily and indignantly we protest against present stupidities and brutalities and injustices, the more passionately we devote ourselves to realize the Kingdom, the more titanic this creation of a new order appears. Nothing we know can remain unaltered; but the smallest improvement takes an unconscionably long while to execute. Haste means folly, and we have to tell ourselves to go slowly. Things as they are have a fixity which demands moral dynamite to unsettle. We ache with curiosity to see how our plans and purposes will work out; we would give anything to be in at the finish. But there is death. We just begin, and then--!""","""Church's role in God's Kingdom""","2074","""The Church's Role in God's Kingdom is a multifaceted and significant aspect of Christian faith. Within Christianity, the term """"church"""" can have multiple meanings. It encompasses both the global body of believers, consisting of all Christians worldwide, and local congregations where believers gather to worship, learn, and serve together. Understanding the role of the Church in God's Kingdom involves delving into its essence, functions, responsibilities, and impact on individuals and society.  At its core, the Church plays a pivotal role in God's Kingdom as the community of believers who follow Jesus Christ. According to Christian belief, Jesus established the Church as a means to carry out His mission on earth, which is to proclaim the Gospel, make disciples, and bear witness to God's love and redemption. The Church, therefore, serves as the earthly vessel through which God's Kingdom is manifested, and His will is done """"on earth as it is in heaven.""""  One of the primary functions of the Church is to nurture and strengthen the faith of its members. Through worship, prayer, teaching, and fellowship, believers are equipped to grow spiritually, deepen their relationship with God, and live out their faith in their daily lives. The Church provides a supportive and nurturing environment where individuals can find guidance, community, and accountability in their journey of faith.  Furthermore, the Church serves as a beacon of light and hope in a world marred by sin, suffering, and brokenness. By engaging in acts of compassion, justice, and mercy, the Church embodies God's love and compassion to those in need. Jesus' teachings on love, forgiveness, and service form the moral and ethical foundation of the Church's mission to care for the marginalized, oppressed, and vulnerable in society.  In addition to providing spiritual guidance and meeting the needs of the community, the Church also serves as a place of worship and celebration. Through sacraments such as baptism and communion, believers participate in God's redemptive work and are united with Christ and with one another. The Church's worship gatherings offer believers an opportunity to express gratitude, adoration, and praise to God for His goodness and faithfulness.  Another crucial aspect of the Church's role in God's Kingdom is the commission to spread the Good News of Jesus Christ to all nations. Known as the Great Commission, this mandate emphasizes the Church's responsibility to share the message of salvation and reconciliation with the world. Through evangelism, missions, and outreach efforts, the Church seeks to invite others into relationship with God and to advance His Kingdom on earth.  Moreover, the Church serves as a source of unity and diversity within the body of Christ. Despite theological differences, cultural distinctions, and denominational affiliations, believers are called to unity in Christ. The Church reflects the beauty of God's Kingdom by embracing people from every nation, ethnicity, and background, united in their common faith and purpose.  In fulfilling its role in God's Kingdom, the Church faces challenges and opportunities in a rapidly changing world. Cultural shifts, social issues, theological debates, and internal conflicts can pose obstacles to the Church's effectiveness and witness. However, through prayer, discernment, humility, and a commitment to biblical truth, the Church can navigate these challenges with faith, wisdom, and integrity.  Ultimately, the Church's role in God's Kingdom is to be a living testimony of God's presence and power in the world. As the body of Christ, the Church is called to embody the values of the Kingdom – love, justice, humility, and compassion – and to reflect God's glory to a watching world. By remaining faithful to its calling, the Church can fulfill its mission to glorify God, edify believers, and impact society for the Kingdom's sake.  In conclusion, the Church's role in God's Kingdom is an indispensable part of Christian faith and practice. By serving as the community of believers, nurturing faith, engaging in mission, and embodying God's love and truth, the Church plays a vital role in advancing God's Kingdom on earth. As believers continue to gather, worship, serve, and proclaim the Gospel, the Church remains a powerful instrument through which God's purposes are fulfilled and His Kingdom is established in the hearts of individuals and the world at large.""","851"
"Bersch Josef","""Since the nature of these admixtures is of the greatest importance to the colour-maker, owing to the considerable influence they exert on the suitability of the minerals for his purposes, it is necessary that these extraneous substances occurring in limestone should be more closely described. Nearly all varieties of limestone contain certain proportions of ferrous and ferric oxides. The presence of ferrous oxide, when the relative amount is but small, cannot be detected by mere inspection; and even many limestones containing really appreciable quantities of ferrous oxide are pure white in colour so long as they are in large lumps. If, however, such a limestone be reduced to powder and exposed to the air for a short time, it gradually assumes a yellow tinge, the depth of which increases with the length of exposure. The cause of this change is due to the fact that ferrous oxide has a great affinity for oxygen, by absorbing which it changes into ferric oxide. (Ferrous oxide consists of FeO, ferric oxide of FeO.) Ferrous oxide and its compounds are of a pale green colour which is not very noticeable, whereas ferric oxide has a very powerful yellow colour, and consequently the limestone, when its superficial area has been greatly increased by reduction to powder, assumes the yellow tinge due to ferric oxide. A limestone exhibiting this property can evidently not be used for making white earth colours, but is, at best, only suitable for mixing with other colours. Occasionally, limestone contains varying quantities of magnesia, and when this oxide is present in large amount, changes into another mineral known as dolomite. In many places this dolomite forms large masses of rock, which, however, is not employed for making colours, owing to the yellow shade imparted by the fairly large amount of ferric oxide present. mineral occurs native in many places, and is frequently worked for a number of purposes. Gypsum occurs in Nature in a great variety of forms. The purest kind is met with either as water-clear crystals, which cleave readily in two directions, or as transparent tabular also cleave easily. Micro-crystalline fine-grained gypsum is milk-white in colour, highly translucent and is largely used, under the name of alabaster, in sculpture. Owing to its low hardness, alabaster can be readily cut with a knife, and on this account is frequently shaped by planing or lathe-turning. Gypsum is generally met with in dense masses, which may be of any colour, grey, blue and reddish shades being the most common, whilst pure white is rarer. The dark-coloured varieties can only be used for manurial purposes; but the white finds a twofold application as a pigment, and, in the calcined state, for making plaster casts. In point of chemical composition, gypsum consists of sulphate of lime, or calcium the magnesia is replaced by ferrous oxide. Talc is quite unaffected by the action of dilute acids, boiling concentrated sulphuric acid being required to decompose it, with separation of silica. Owing to its low specific gravity and chemical indifference, talc is suitable for lightening the shade of certain lake pigments. It can also be used as a pigment by itself, and also as a gloss on wall-paper, for mixing with paper pulp, and for various other purposes. Clay The mineral known as clay is, in all cases, a product of the decomposition of other minerals, mainly felspar. This substance is a double silicate of alumina and potash, KO.AlO.(SiO). Pure kaolin is, or % silica, % alumina, % water. Clay may be supposed to have been formed by the conversion of felspar, under the action of air and water, into silicate of alumina, the silicate of potash being dissolved out. Being insoluble, the silicate of alumina would be transported by the water, in a very fine state of division, and finally deposited as a sediment, which in course of time became a solid mass. This, when again brought into contact with water, forms a very plastic pulp which, when dried and baked, forms a solid mass, brick, which is no longer affected by water. Perfectly pure clay forms a white mass, which, under the name of China clay or kaolin, is used for making porcelain, and is only occasionally met with in large quantities. Pure kaolin is characterised by its great chemical indifference, being decomposed only by strong alkalis and sulphuric acid. At the high temperature of the pottery kiln, kaolin sinters to a very compact mass, but cannot be fused, except when small quantities are subjected to the intense heat of the oxyhydrogen flame, whereupon it fuses to a colourless glass of great hardness. In an impure state, silicate of alumina occurs frequently in Nature, and then forms the minerals known under the generic names of clay, loam, marl, etc. These impure clays contain varying proportions of extraneous minerals which produce changes in the physical and chemical properties. They are grey, blue or yellow in colour, the grey and blue varieties mostly containing appreciable quantities of ferrous oxide, whilst the yellow kinds contain ferric oxide. When fired, all of them become yellow or red, the ferrous oxide being transformed into ferric oxide by the heat. Some fairly white clays are high in lime, which makes them fusible at high temperatures. In some very impure kinds, even the comparatively low heat of the brick-kiln is sufficient to cause partial fusion.""","""Limestone and its mineral properties""","1152","""Limestone is a versatile sedimentary rock that is composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). It forms from the accumulation of marine organisms such as coral, shells, algae, and other calcium-rich materials over millions of years. This natural process creates a unique rock with distinctive mineral properties that make it valuable in various industries and applications.  One of the key mineral properties of limestone is its durability. Limestone is a hard and dense rock that can withstand weathering and erosion, making it suitable for use in construction materials. Its durability ensures that structures built with limestone can last for centuries, as evidenced by historical landmarks like the Great Pyramids of Giza and the Parthenon in Athens. This durability also makes limestone a popular choice for paving stones, countertops, and other architectural elements.  Another important mineral property of limestone is its solubility in acidic solutions. Because limestone contains calcium carbonate, which reacts with acids to produce carbon dioxide gas, it is susceptible to dissolution in acidic environments. This property is evident in the formation of geological features such as caves, sinkholes, and karst landscapes where groundwater dissolves limestone over time, creating unique landforms.  Limestone also exhibits a variety of colors and patterns due to the presence of impurities and minerals within its structure. While pure limestone is typically white or light gray, impurities like iron oxide, organic materials, and clay minerals can give limestone a range of colors including yellow, brown, red, and black. These variations in color and pattern make limestone a visually appealing material for use in architecture, interior design, and art.  Moreover, the mineral composition of limestone influences its chemical properties, which have practical applications in many industries. For example, when heated, limestone decomposes to produce lime (calcium oxide), which is essential in the manufacturing of cement, steel, glass, and paper. This process, known as calcination, releases carbon dioxide and results in a valuable industrial byproduct that is used in various applications.  Additionally, limestone's mineral properties make it a valuable resource for agriculture. Agricultural limestone, also known as aglime, is used to neutralize soil acidity and provide essential nutrients like calcium and magnesium to crops. By improving soil pH and nutrient levels, limestone helps enhance crop yields and promote healthy plant growth, making it a vital component in sustainable agriculture practices.  Furthermore, limestone's mineral properties extend to its use in water treatment and purification processes. Limestone is employed in the treatment of acidic mine drainage and municipal wastewater to neutralize acidity and remove contaminants like heavy metals. Its high surface area and reactivity make limestone an effective filtration medium for removing impurities and improving water quality.  In conclusion, limestone's mineral properties encompass a wide range of characteristics that make it a valuable and versatile rock in various industries and applications. Its durability, solubility, color variations, chemical reactivity, agricultural benefits, and water treatment capabilities highlight the importance of this sedimentary rock in our daily lives. Whether it's in the construction of buildings, the cultivation of crops, or the purification of water, limestone continues to be a fundamental resource that contributes to our society's advancement and sustainability.""","627"
"Williams Cora May","""Variability depends to a considerable extent on the size of a genus, but only in so far as greater size involves greater complexity and variety of interests; the vast but homogeneous societies of the East being less progressive than the smaller but more complex ones of the West. 'Where freer scope is left to individual inclinations or aptitudes, there the friction of mind against mind is more intense. New ideas are generated in the more vivid consciousness of the people, and life becomes more inventive.' Species developed from a common genus will show some common traits and some rules of mutual observance, savage peoples which have divided into tribes being an exception to the latter part of the statement, for the reason that lower societies have very little moral cohesion; they may be compared to lower organisms which reproduce themselves by fission, or to homogeneous colonies of animals, like sponges. Under the generic institutions we must not include those which arise merely as the result of similar circumstances. Ideals once formed advance at very different rates, though the tendency to divergence is always being corrected by the diffusion of ideas. But where one nation takes ideas from another, these ideas are not borrowed, in the sense that they come wholly from the other nation; there must have been, in the borrowing nation, a development of ideas up to the point that makes the borrowing possible,--a similar development to that of the nation from which the borrowing takes place, due to similar circumstances. The communication of moral ideas does not depend upon race-community, as is shown by the ready adoption of Western ideas by such nations as the Hindoos and Japanese. In general language, we identify development and progress; and this is true also in the case of morality. Goodness means progress; wickedness, retrogression or else stagnation, which, compared with advance, is retrogression. 'In changing from one form to another, morality changes from what is right under one set of conditions to what is right under another set, and such change from good to good is what we mean by becoming better. To deny this is to find some other standard of advance than in the actual movement which has taken place, to put an a priori conception of development in place of the facts.' 'The moral ideal is always, therefore, a progress, for either the society is single, and goodness represents the law of its advance, or if the society is part of a larger one, its ideal can be retrogressive only because the society is so far bad.' 'And since goodness and badness exhaust the field of moral possibilities, if the propositions that goodness means progress, and badness regress, are both true, we must be able to convert them, and maintain that all progress is due to goodness and all regress to badness.' To do this, we must distinguish between degradation and a mere degeneration which involves a return to simpler conditions as an adaptation to changed environment. Such degeneration as adaptation to circumstances, in an individual or a society as a whole, is progress. Fish who become blind by living in the dark become thus better fitted to their circumstances, and the like is true of moral degeneration under simpler conditions. Old age and death are characteristic of the higher type of organism, in distinction from the lower types which, multiplying by fission, are practically eternal; they are conditions of the advantage of type, in which the individual is partaker. So a good society under simpler conditions is on the side of progress, though it may lie outside the main line of advance. It is true that bad persons often help on progress, but the good they do lies in their representation of the will of society for progress, the evil lies in their use of this will as means to their own ends. It may be objected, too, that the good man is sometimes a hindrance to progress through stupidity; but to this is to be answered that intellect itself becomes morally characterized in action. All events and institutions are thus determined by their conditions; but there is a movement forward distinguishable from the delay of stragglers and the resistance of enemies, and this distinction is enforced by the moral predicates of good and bad. Our theory does not imply that whatever is, is right; such a statement involves the use of the word right in the sense of 'correct,' or 'intelligible,' 'accountable by reflection.' Nor is the doctrine fatalistic. Fatalism implies that men act at the impulse of some force which they do not understand; 'but the history of mankind is the history of beings who, through their own gift of consciousness, subdue circumstances to their own characters.' In judging a nation's development, we must not interpret it according to our own likings, as progression or retrogression; nor must we imagine retrogression from relaxation of duties in some certain directions, but must regard the society and its institutions as a whole. The test of higher organization usually given is that of increasing differentiation of parts with corresponding specialization of function. But the main course of progress is not linear, or in one continuous direction; apparent reversions to former types are only apparent; the new type stands higher than the old. In other words, history moves in cycles. It follows, from this, that mere differentiation is insufficient for definition. While the differentiation advances, its significance alters, or, let us say, the relative places of specialization and of unity alter. Along with differentiation goes a process of integration. Great revolutions simplify. The result of greater and greater heterogeneity is to produce a new principle, which combines the warring elements. The definition of progress by increased differentiation is lacking in two ways: It tells us nothing of the forces by which progress is produced, and it gives no connected view of the actual facts of historical development. A general statement of progress in its formal sense is found in the conception of a struggle of ideals. But as in this struggle the survival of the fittest does not necessarily mean the destruction of those who represented the defeated ideal, but the supplanting of their ideal by another, the movement is one of comprehension, and we should expect to find, and do find, the history of morality exhibit the gradual development of a universal moral order, good not for one group of men but for all. It would be a misapprehension to regard this change as merely quantitative, as if the virtues were the same whether they applied on a larger or a smaller scale. 'The quantitative extension is parallel with, and in reality proceeds from, a change in the conception of the human person himself.' In primitive communities, the individual is so limited that he can hardly be called an individual at all. First among the Greeks do we find the person the embodiment of the social order, but in a limited sense. 'When this limitation breaks down, and the individual stands forth as independent and self-conscious, the author of the laws he obeys, we have at the same time the extension of the area of persons with whom he is in moral relation.' 'It matters little that the Western ideal of a society of humanity is realized to so slight an extent. The ideal exists and implies the inclusion of mankind.' The principle of democracy, which we are engaged in working out, 'continues, or perhaps supersedes, under much more complex conditions and over a wider range of institutions, the same principle as Christianity introduced.' It is not merely an identical element in many individual states, but a comprehensive ideal. The power of naturalization, extradition laws, international action among the working classes, etc., imply this. This 'comprehension' is not merely one of breadth, but of depth as well: the ideal includes not only the present of mankind, but its whole future also. Duties have always been recognized to posterity, but the range of generations to whom they applied was small, and the interests which it was believed could be secured were limited also. Apres moi le deluge describes a form of selfishness of all ages, but different ages have understood the apres moi quite differently. At the present day, the range of responsibility is extending indefinitely. A common political ideal does not mean a universal peace. Coarser forms of dispute disappear, but, on the other hand, as nations grow more refined in their ideals, they grow more susceptible. What a political humanity, or a political community of Europe, would mean, is the substitution of international punishment for the self-willed conflicts of irresponsible nations. We cannot say what the future of society and of morality may be,--whether mankind will be able to take mechanical means against a period of ice, or whether human society may not, as a whole, be destroyed, to be replaced by a higher type of existence, which may arise on the earth from the development of humanity, or may, on some other planet, take up the tale of human civilization as we take up that of the civilization of Greece and Rome. Two things follow from the progressive character of the moral ideal: that the classification and description of duties will vary with each age; that, as the ideal changes from age to age, the highest moral principle or sentiment will change with it. At the present time, a belief has gained great authority, that the sense of duty is transitory and will finally disappear; but whether we, with Spencer, identify obligation with coercion, or understand it as the relation of a part of conduct to the rest, in neither sense is the proposition true as it stands.""","""Moral Progress and Society Development""","1904","""Moral progress and societal development are intertwined concepts that shape the evolution of human civilization. At the core of both notions lies the idea of improvement, not only in material or technological aspects but also in the ethical and moral dimensions of society. Over centuries, societies have grappled with defining what constitutes moral progress and how it can be achieved, leading to ongoing debates and shifts in societal norms. This complex interplay between moral values and societal advancement has been a driving force in shaping the history of humanity.  At the heart of moral progress is the notion of advancing ethical standards to create fairer, more just, and compassionate societies. This involves a collective effort to address issues such as equality, human rights, environmental sustainability, and social justice. Moral progress requires societies to reflect on their values, beliefs, and behaviors, critically examining existing norms and traditions to determine if they align with principles of fairness, empathy, and respect for others. It involves challenging prejudices, discriminations, and injustices, and striving towards a more inclusive and equitable world for all individuals.  Societal development, on the other hand, encompasses a broader spectrum of progress, including economic growth, technological advancement, governance structures, education systems, healthcare provision, and infrastructure development. While these material advancements are crucial for improving the quality of life for people, true societal development cannot be achieved without accompanying moral progress. A society that prioritizes economic prosperity over ethical considerations risks perpetuating inequalities, exploitation, and environmental degradation.  Throughout history, moral progress has often been the driving force behind significant societal changes. Movements advocating for civil rights, gender equality, environmental conservation, and peace have pushed societies to confront injustices and strive for a more ethical and harmonious world. Leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malala Yousafzai have become symbols of moral courage, inspiring others to stand up against oppression and advocate for positive change.  In the realm of governance, the concept of the social contract underscores the importance of moral values in shaping the relationship between the state and its citizens. A just and ethical government is one that upholds the rule of law, protects individual rights, promotes the common good, and operates with transparency and accountability. Societies that prioritize moral principles in their governance structures are more likely to foster trust, social cohesion, and sustainable development.  Education also plays a pivotal role in fostering moral progress and societal development. Schools, universities, and educational institutions have a responsibility to instill values of empathy, tolerance, critical thinking, and ethical decision-making in students. By promoting social awareness, cultural understanding, and civic engagement, education equips individuals with the tools to contribute positively to society and advocate for moral causes.  Technology and globalization have further interconnected societies around the world, presenting new opportunities and challenges for moral progress. While technological advancements have improved communication, healthcare, and access to information, they have also raised ethical dilemmas related to privacy, security, automation, and social media influence. As societies become more interconnected, the need for shared moral values and global cooperation becomes increasingly apparent to address pressing issues such as climate change, poverty, and pandemics.  In conclusion, moral progress and societal development are indispensable components of a thriving and just civilization. As we navigate the complexities of the modern world, it is essential for individuals, communities, and nations to prioritize ethical considerations in decision-making processes, policies, and actions. By upholding values of compassion, integrity, respect, and solidarity, we can collectively work towards a more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive society where all individuals can flourish and contribute to the common good. Ultimately, the journey towards moral progress and societal development is a continuous and dynamic process that requires introspection, dialogue, and concerted efforts from all members of the global community.""","754"
"Smyth Eleanor C Hill","""Carrick-on-Shannon was the only town in County Leitrim which received a mail, and that not oftener than twice a week. Several districts in Ireland were served only at the cost of their inhabitants. Besides London, Bath alone favoured by its two distinguished citizens, Ralph Allen and John Palmer had, before 1792, more than one letter-carrier; and many important centres of population, such as Norwich, York, Derby, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and Plymouth, had none at all the postmaster, and in some instances a single assistant, constituting the entire staff, no sort of duty outside the official walls being undertaken. The Channel Islands were treated as though they had been in another planet. Before 1794 they had no postal communication with the rest of the United Kingdom, though for some years local enterprise had provided them with an inter-insular service. When Palmer appeared on the scene, the number of towns in the British Isles which received mails increased rapidly, while those already served two or three times a week began to receive a post daily. In no respect, perhaps, has greater progress been made than in the matter of mail conveyance, both as regards acceleration and safety, and in other ways. In Witherings' time about two months were required for a letter and its answer to pass between London and Scotland or London and Ireland. Exchange of correspondence between the three kingdoms was, strange to say, far less expeditiously carried on than that between London and Madrid. But when it is remembered how direful was the condition of our thoroughfares in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the impossibility of anything like swift progress becomes evident. Ruts there were, says Arthur Young, which measured 3 feet in depth, and in wet weather were filled to the brim with water; while in Guy Mannering Scott speaks of districts only accessible through a succession of tremendous morasses. In Waverley (temp. 1745) is described the Northern Diligence, a huge, old-fashioned tub drawn by three horses, which completed the journey from Edinburgh to London ('God willing,' as the advertisement expressed it) in three weeks. Twenty years later, even, the coaches spent from twelve to fourteen days upon the journey, and went once a month only. In some places the roads were so bad that it was necessary to erect beacons alongside them to keep the travelling public after dark from falling into the ponds and bogs which lined the highways and sometimes encroached upon them. Elsewhere, the ponderous machines groaned or clattered over rocky and precipitous ways, rolling and pitching like a vessel on an angry sea. Not even by the more lightly-freighted men on foot and boys mounted on the wretched steeds provided for the Post Office service could swifter progress be made. No wonder that letter and answer should travel but slowly. In 1784, when Palmer proposed the abolition of these slow-moving and far from trustworthy mail-carriers, and the substitution in their place of the existing stage-coaches, great were the scorn and indignation of the postal authorities. Seven miles an hour instead of three and a half! And coaches instead of post-boys! Were ever such mad proposals heard of! The officials were amazed that any dissatisfaction, any desire for change should exist. Not so very long before, they had plumed themselves on the gratifying fact that in five days an answer to a letter might be had from a place distant 200 miles from the writer. And now, even in face of that notable advance, the public wanted further concessions! One prominent official could not see why the post should be the swiftest conveyance in England. Another was sure that if travelling were made quicker, the correspondence of the country would be thrown into the utmost confusion. But he thought and perhaps the parentage of the thought was not far to seek that to expedite the mails was simply impossible. The officials, indeed, were unanimously of opinion that the thing is totally impracticable. And, doubtless, Palmer was set down as a visionary and a revolutionist names to be bestowed, some fifty-three years later, upon another persistent reformer. A second Committee, formed to consider Palmer's proposals, reported that it had examined the oldest and ablest officers of the Post Office, and they had no confidence whatever in the plan. It is always, said Brougham, when, in the Upper House, he was advocating adoption of the later reform, the oldest and ablest, for the Committee considered the terms synonymous. Thus does history repeat itself. As it was with Palmer, so, before him, it was with Witherings and Dockwra; and, after him, with Rowland Hill. The unforgivable offence is to be wiser than one's opponents, and to achieve success when failure has been predicted. But worse things than prophecy of failure accompany reforms, attempted or accomplished, and act like a discordant chorus striving to drown sweet music. Prophecy of dire results, such as ruin of society, disruption of the Empire, etc., are sometimes raised, and carry dismay into the hearts of the timid. My father, who was born less than forty-three years after the change of style, as a child often heard old people, in all seriousness, lament the loss of our eleven days, and declare that since it was made everything in this country had gone wrong. I too, when young, have heard aged lips attribute the awful cholera visitation of 1832 to our sinfulness in passing the Catholic Emancipation Bill; and the potato disease and consequent Irish famine in the mid 'forties to interference with the sacred Corn Laws. We laugh at this sort of thing to-day, but are we much wiser than our forebears? Although these great reforms differ widely in character, the gloomy predictions concerning them are substantially alike. The terrible things prophesied never come to pass; and of the reforms when once established no sane person wishes to get rid. When at last Palmer had borne down opposition and been placed in authority, he set to work in a far-reaching, statesmanlike manner. The old, worthless vehicles which, owing to their frequent habit of breaking down on the road, had become a constant source of complaint, were gradually got rid of; and by 1792 all his mail-coaches were new. He was a born organiser, and insisted on the introduction and maintenance of business-like methods. Unnecessary stoppages along the road were put an end to, and necessary stoppages shortened; the mail-bags to be taken on were made up before the coaches appeared, the mail-bags to be taken off were ready to the guard's hand; and strict punctuality was enforced. The guards and coachmen were armed, and no one unskilled in the use of firearms was employed in either capacity. The harness and other accoutrements were kept in good repair, the coaches were well-horsed, and the relays were made with reasonable frequency. Palmer had calculated that sixteen hours ought to suffice for the London and Bath coach when covering the distance between the two cities. The time usually spent on the road was thirty-eight hours. The first mail-coach which started from Bath to London under his auspices in 1784 performed the journey in seventeen hours, proving with what nearness to absolute accuracy he had made his calculations. For a while seventeen hours became the customary time-limit. Not long after this date mail-coaches were plying on all the principal roads. Before the first of Palmer's coaches went to Liverpool, that seaport was served by one letter-carrier. Ten years later, six were needed. One postman had sufficed for Edinburgh; now four were required. Manchester till 1792 had but one letter-carrier, and its postal staff consisted of an aged widow and her daughter. Previous to 1794 the Isle of Wight was served by one postmaster and one letter-carrier only. Before Palmer took over the management of the coaches they were robbed, along one road or another, at least once a week. It was not till his rule was ten years old that a coach was stopped or robbed; and then it was not a highwayman, but a passenger who did the looting. Before 1784 the annual expenditure incurred through prosecution of the thieves had been a heavy charge on the service, one trial alone that of the brothers Weston, who figure in Thackeray's Denis Duval having cost 4,000. This burden on the Post Office revenue henceforth shrank into comparatively insignificant dimensions. Palmer traversed the entire kingdom along its coach routes, making notes of the length of time consumed on each journey, calculating in how much less time it could be performed by the newer vehicles, and always keeping an observant eye on other possible improvements. Before the end of the eighteenth century Dockwra's London penny post had fallen upon evil days. Neglect and mismanagement had been its lot for many years; there was a steady diminution of its area, and no accounts were kept of its gains. Palmer looked into the condition of the local post, as, in addition to the mail conveyance, he had already looked into the condition of the newspaper post and other things which stood in need of rectification; and, later, the old penny post, now transformed into a twopenny post, was taken in hand by Johnson, who, from the position of letter-carrier, rose, by sheer ability, to the office of Deputy Comptroller of the Penny Post. As a rule, Palmer was fortunate in choosing subordinates, of whom several not only accomplished useful work long after their chief had been dismissed, but who introduced reforms on their own account. Hasker, the head superintendent of the mail-coaches, kept the vehicles, horses, accoutrements, etc., to say nothing of the officials, quite up to Palmer's level. But in another chosen man the great reformer was fatally deceived, for Bonner intrigued against his benefactor, and helped to bring about his downfall. One reform paves the way for succeeding reforms.""","""Evolution of Postal Services in Britain""","2071","""The evolution of postal services in Britain is a fascinating journey that spans centuries, reflecting the country's technological advancements, social changes, and economic progress. From humble beginnings as a royal courier service to the modern-day efficient and reliable postal system, the history of British postal services is a testament to innovation and adaptation in response to the changing needs of society.  The story of postal services in Britain can be traced back to the 12th century when King Henry I established an official royal postal service. This service primarily served the crown's communication needs, allowing for the efficient exchange of important messages and letters between the king and his officials. Over time, the postal service expanded its reach beyond the royal court, catering to the needs of the growing merchant class and the general public.  One of the key milestones in the evolution of British postal services was the creation of the General Post Office (GPO) in 1660. Under the leadership of Henry Bishop, the first Postmaster General, the GPO standardized postal rates and established a network of post offices across the country. This development laid the foundation for a more organized and efficient postal system that connected different regions of Britain.  The 19th century marked a period of significant transformation for the British postal system with the introduction of key innovations such as the uniform penny post in 1840. This revolutionary reform, spearheaded by Rowland Hill, introduced affordable postage rates for letters, making postal services accessible to a wider segment of the population. The introduction of postage stamps, with the iconic Penny Black being the world's first adhesive stamp, further streamlined the postal system and facilitated the prepayment of postage.  The advent of the railway network in the 19th century played a crucial role in enhancing the speed and efficiency of postal services in Britain. The introduction of mail trains enabled rapid transportation of letters and parcels between different cities and regions, significantly reducing delivery times. The establishment of railway post offices, where postal workers sorted mail en route, further expedited the processing and distribution of mail across the country.  The 20th century witnessed continued innovation and modernization in British postal services. The establishment of the Post Office Act in 1969 led to the reorganization of the General Post Office into separate entities, including the Post Office, Royal Mail, and Parcelforce. This restructuring aimed to improve operational efficiency and customer service while adapting to the changing demands of a modernizing society.  The digital revolution of the late 20th century and the rise of email and electronic communication posed new challenges to traditional postal services. However, British postal services responded proactively by embracing technology and diversifying their offerings. The introduction of online postage services, parcel tracking systems, and e-commerce solutions helped Royal Mail stay competitive in a rapidly changing market.  In recent years, British postal services have continued to evolve in response to shifting consumer preferences and technological advancements. The privatization of Royal Mail in 2013 marked a significant turning point, allowing the company greater flexibility to adapt to market trends and invest in innovation. The growing demand for parcel delivery services due to the rise of online shopping has prompted Royal Mail to expand its capabilities and infrastructure to meet the needs of e-commerce customers.  Today, British postal services stand as a testament to resilience, adaptability, and innovation. The legacy of the royal courier service has evolved into a modern postal system that not only delivers letters and parcels but also offers a range of additional services, including banking, logistics, and retail solutions. As Britain continues to embrace digital transformation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the postal services sector remains at the forefront of innovation, ensuring that the timeless tradition of sending and receiving mail endures in a rapidly changing world.""","735"
"Griggs Edward Howard","""On the other hand, let a corporation take its artisans into its confidence, give each a small proportionate share in the annual earnings. Each worker will feel increasingly that the business is his business. He will take pride in his accomplishment. Gradually he will attain efficiency, and work permanently, without oversight, with a consistent earnestness no boss's whip ever attained, The experience of the National Cash Register Company at Dayton, Ohio, proves this. The experiments of Henry Ford are a step toward the same solution. So, in lesser measure, is the plan of the Steel trust to permit and encourage its employees to purchase annually its stock, somewhat below the current market price, giving a substantial bonus if the stock is held over ten years. If you wish an illustration on a larger scale, consider the mass formation tactics of the German soldiers, in contrast to the individual courage, initiative and action of the French. There are the two types of efficiency in sheerest contrast, but beyond is always the question of their effect on manhood. France has saved and regenerated her soul; but Germany--? Further, the breakdown of paternalistically achieved efficiency has been evident in Germany's utter failure to understand the mind of other peoples, particularly of democracies. She had voluminous data, gathered by the most atrociously efficient spy system ever developed, yet she utterly misread the mind of France, England and the United States. The same break-down is evident in Germany's failure in colonization in contrast to England's success. For offensive war, it must be admitted, the efficiency under the boss's whip will go further. For defensive war, or war for high moral aims, it is desirable that the individual soldier should think for himself, respond to the high appeal. Thus for such warfare the efficiency of voluntary effort and cooperation is superior. An autocracy would better rule its soldiers by a military caste; there can be no excuse for such in a democracy. Thus, the utmost possible fraternization of officers and men is desirable, and social snobbery, the snubbing of officers who come up from the ranks, and other anachronistic survivals, should be stamped out, as utterly foreign to what should be the spirit of the military arm of democracy. Further, in estimating the two types, one must remember that paternalism may exercise its power in secret and that it accomplishes much in the dark. Democracy, on the other hand, is afflicted and blessed with pitiless publicity. Thus its evils are all exposed, it washes all its dirty linen in public; but the main thing is to get it clean. When it comes to invention and initiative, as already indicated, democracy has the advantage, immediately, as in the long run. We are the most inventive people on earth, and that quality is a direct result of our democratic individualism. It is a significant fact that most of the startling inventions used in this War were made in America--but developed and applied in Germany. There, again, are evident the contrasting results of the two types of social organization. The indefatigably industrious and docile German mind can work out and apply the inventions furnished it, with marvelous persistency and effectiveness, under paternal control. We have the problem of achieving by voluntary effort and cooperation a persistent thoroughness in working out the ideas and inventions that come to us in such abundant measure. The path of democracy is education. XIX THE FOR When we say that the path of democracy is education, we do not mean that there is an easy solution of its problem. There is no patent medicine we can feed the American people and cure it of its diseases. There is no specific for the menaces that threaten. Eternal vigilance and effort are the price, not only of liberty, but of every good of man. Let things alone, and they get bad; to keep them good, we must struggle everlastingly to make them better. Leave the pool of politics unstirred by putting into it ever new individual thought and ideal, and how quickly it becomes a stagnant, ill-smelling pond. Leave a church unvitalized, by ever fresh personal consecration, and how quickly it becomes a dead form, hampering the life of the spirit. Leave a university uninfluenced by ever new earnestness and devotion on the part of student and teacher, and how soon it becomes a scholastic machine, positively oppressing the mind and spirit. There is a true sense in which the universe exists momentarily by the grace of God. Take light away, and you have darkness. Take darkness away, and you have not necessarily light; you might have chaos. Take health away, and you have disease. Take disease away, and you have not necessarily health; you may have death. Take virtue away, and you have vice. Take vice away, and you have not necessarily virtue; you might have negative respectability. Thus it is the continual affirmation of the good that keeps the heritage of yesterday and takes the step toward to-morrow. Nevertheless, if there is no easy solution of the problem, there are certain big lines of attack. If we are right in our diagnosis, that the problem of democracy is a problem of education, then our whole system of education, for child, youth and adult, should be reconstructed to focus upon the building of positive and effective moral personality. American education began as a subsidiary process. Children got organic education in the home, on the farm, in the work shop. They went to school to get certain formal disciplines, to learn to read, write and cipher and to acquire formal grammar. With the moving into the cities, the industrial revolution and the entire transformation of our life, the school has had to take over more and more of the process of organic education. If children fail to get such education in the school, they are apt to miss it altogether. With this entire change in the meaning of the school, old notions of its purpose still survive. Probably no one is so benighted to-day as to imagine that the chief function of the school is to fill the mind with information; but there are many who still hold to the tradition that the chief purpose of education is to sharpen the intellectual tools of the individual for the sake of his personal success. This notion is a misleading survival, for tools are of value only in terms of the character using them. The same equipment may serve, equally, good or bad ends. Only as education focusses on the development of positive and effective moral character can it aid in solving the problem of democracy. Need it be added that this does not mean teaching morals and manners to children, thirty minutes a day, three times a week? That is a minor fragment of moral education. It means that all phases of the process-- the relation of pupil and teacher, school and home, the government and discipline, the lessons taught in every subject, the environment, the proportioning of the curriculum, of physical, emotional and intellectual culture--all shall be focussed and organized upon the one significant aim of the whole--character. Further, if education is to overcome the menaces and solve the dilemma of democracy, it must be carried beyond childhood and youth and outside the walls of academic institutions. The ever wider education of adult citizenship is indispensable to the progress and safety of democracy. It is one of the glaring illustrations of the inefficiency of our democracy that there are still communities where school boards build school houses with public money, open them five or six hours, five days in the week, and refuse to allow them to be opened any other hour of the day or night, for a civic forum, parents' meeting, public lecture or other activity of adult education; and yet we call ourselves a practical people! Surely, in a democracy, the state is as vitally interested in the education of the adult citizen as of the child. Herein is the significance of those various extensions of education, developing and spreading so widely to-day. University-extension and Chautauqua movements, civic forums, free lectures to the people by boards of education and public libraries, summer schools, night schools for adults--all are illustrations of this movement, so vital to the progress of democracy. Through these instrumentalities the popular ideal may be elevated, the public mind may be trained to more logical and earnest thought, citizenship may be made more serious and intelligent, and finally a most helpful influence may be exerted on the academic institutions themselves. It is an easily verifiable truth that any academic institution that builds around itself an enclosing scholastic wall, refuses to go outside and serve and learn in the larger world of humanity, in the long run inevitably dies of academic dry rot. In the endeavor to solve the problem of democracy cannot we do more than we have done hitherto in cultivating reverence for moral leadership--the quality so much needed in democracy at the present hour? This may be achieved through many aspects of education, but especially through contact with noble souls in literature and history. History, above all, is the great opportunity, and, from this point of view, is it not necessary to rewrite our histories: instead of portraying solely statesmen and warriors, to fill them with lofty examples of leadership in all walks of life? Women as well as men: for surely ideals of both should be fostered. A colleague, interested in this problem, recently took one of the most widely used text-books of American history, and counted the pages on which a woman was mentioned. Of the five hundred pages, there were four: not four pages devoted to women; but four mentioning a woman. What does it mean: that women have contributed less than one part in a hundred and five to the development of American life?""","""Corporate Employee Ownership and Democracy""","1958","""Corporate Employee Ownership and Democracy play a pivotal role in shaping the modern workplace landscape, emphasizing the empowerment of workers and fostering a sense of shared responsibility within organizations. This model of ownership challenges traditional hierarchical structures by giving employees a stake in the success of the company, encouraging participation in decision-making processes, and aligning their interests with those of the organization as a whole. By delving into the dynamics of employee ownership and democracy within the corporate world, we can explore how these concepts contribute to a more equitable, transparent, and sustainable business environment.  Employee ownership refers to the practice of granting employees a financial interest in the company they work for, typically through stocks, profit-sharing programs, or employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs). This ownership structure can take various forms, such as direct ownership where employees hold shares directly or indirect ownership where shares are held on behalf of employees through a trust. One of the key benefits of employee ownership is that it gives employees a tangible stake in the company's performance and long-term success. This sense of ownership can lead to increased employee engagement, motivation, and commitment, as individuals are not just working for a paycheck but also for a share of the company's profits and growth.  Moreover, employee ownership can foster a culture of accountability and transparency within organizations. When employees have a say in the decision-making process, they are more likely to take ownership of their work, contribute innovative ideas, and hold themselves and their colleagues accountable for their actions. This participatory approach to management can also help organizations tap into the collective wisdom and expertise of their workforce, leading to more informed and effective decision-making processes. By involving employees in key strategic discussions and planning initiatives, companies can benefit from diverse perspectives, enhance employee morale, and build a stronger sense of community and shared purpose.  Democracy in the corporate setting goes hand in hand with employee ownership, as it involves the principles of fairness, equality, and inclusivity in organizational governance. In a democratic workplace, decisions are made collectively, and power is distributed among employees rather than concentrated at the top of the hierarchy. This model promotes a more egalitarian organizational structure where all employees have a voice and the opportunity to participate in shaping the future direction of the company. By embracing democratic principles, companies can leverage the collective intelligence of their workforce, improve communication and collaboration, and create a more inclusive and democratic work environment.  Employee ownership and democracy also have significant implications for corporate governance and leadership. In a traditional corporate structure, power is often centralized in the hands of a few executives or board members, leading to potential conflicts of interest, lack of accountability, and limited input from employees. By contrast, a model based on employee ownership and democracy redistributes power more evenly among stakeholders, fostering a more balanced and collaborative decision-making process. This can help mitigate the agency problem, where the interests of managers may not always align with those of shareholders, by ensuring that employees have a direct stake in the company's performance and are actively involved in overseeing its operations.  Furthermore, employee ownership and democracy can have positive implications for organizational performance and sustainability. Research has shown that companies with employee ownership tend to outperform their counterparts in terms of productivity, profitability, and long-term stability. This is attributed to a combination of factors, including higher levels of employee engagement, lower turnover rates, and a stronger sense of organizational commitment among staff. By empowering employees to make meaningful contributions to the company and giving them a direct stake in its success, organizations can create a more resilient, adaptive, and competitive business model that is better positioned to navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace.  In conclusion, Corporate Employee Ownership and Democracy represent a transformative approach to organizational governance, emphasizing the importance of empowerment, participation, and shared responsibility in the corporate world. By granting employees a stake in the company's success and involving them in decision-making processes, organizations can cultivate a more engaged, committed, and productive workforce, leading to improved performance, innovation, and sustainability. Moving forward, it is imperative for companies to embrace the principles of employee ownership and democracy, not only as a means to enhance their bottom line but also as a way to foster a more democratic, equitable, and inclusive workplace culture that benefits employees, shareholders, and society as a whole.""","847"
"Jenkins Hester Donaldson","""Rustem, feeling very badly, asked the Grand Seigneur not to let him go, who replied, When I see Ibrahim, I will see that he causes you to return near me. For this reason the army was without council except Ibrahim alone, and men of learning and force, from fear and suspicion, hid their knowledge and ability. So the army was demoralized and enervated. I feel certain that Ibrahim Pasha realized this (for he was a man of good parts, but not of such merit as to find a remedy for such evils), but he loved himself much more than he did his lord, and wished to be alone in the dominion of the world in which he was much respected. This criticism of Ibrahim Pasha was later repeated in a more general form by one Kogabey, who presented to Sultan Mourad IV a memorial on the decadence of the Ottoman state. The two first reasons that he assigned for the deterioration were the sultans ceasing to preside over the divan in person, and the placing of favorites in the office of grand vizir, the latter custom having been started by Suleiman I, who raised his favorite Ibrahim from the palace to the divan. Such vizirs, Kogabey explained, had no insight into the circumstances of the whole nation. They generally were blinded by the splendor of their position and refused to consult intelligent men on affairs of government, and so the order of the state was destroyed through their carelessness. The custom of appointing favorites to the most important office in the empire was certainly a bad one, but Ibrahim was a more efficient administrator than could have been expected from his training, and ranks among the great vizirs of the Ottoman Empire. III THE We must now turn from Turkeys internal affairs to her foreign relations. Turkish political history during the sixteenth century was so interwoven with that of the European states, the influence of Ottoman interference upon the wars and negotiations of Christian princes was so marked, that a study of Suleimans foreign relations becomes almost a study of contemporary Europe. The two sultans who succeeded Mohammed the Conqueror had not extended Turkish power in Europe, Bayazid having failed in his attempts at conquest, and Selim having turned his attention from Europe to the East. This caused a period of transition and preparation for the great events of Suleimans reign. When Suleiman came to the throne, he found certain relations established with Ragusa and Venice, the two commercial cities of the Adriatic, whose large carrying trade made an entente cordiale with the Porte very desirable. Ragusa was the first foreign state to reach the new sultan with her congratulations on his accession, and the sultan renewed with the Ragusan republic the commercial privileges it had enjoyed in Egypt. After Venice had been defeated by Turkey in the battle of Sapienza in 499 and had been obliged to sue for peace, she had received the following answer from the then grand vizir: You can tell the doge that he has done wedding the sea, it is our turn now. This boast became steadily more completely realized as Turkish conquest in the Mediterranean continued, and Venice soon saw that her chance of freedom on the seas lay in keeping on good terms with the Turk, whom she could not conquer. In vain she sought for help against the Moslems; in vain she carried on a single handed struggle against their encroachments, earning the title of Bulwark of Christianity. Had she not learned to kiss the hand that she could not cut off, she could not have continued to exist as even the second rate power in the Levant to which she had been reduced. Frequent missions were sent from Venice to the Porte, and a Venetian baillie was kept at the Porte. These baillies were very good statesmen, and they not only kept Venice on good terms with Turkey for thirty three years, but they made an invaluable contribution to recorded history by sending frequent and detailed reports to the signories. Russia also sent an embassy to the Porte, after the conquests of Belgrad and Rhodes had demonstrated the power of Turkey; and the Tsar, recognizing the value of an alliance with the Porte, made two attempts to form one, but without success. Suleiman saw no advantage in such an alliance, but he never assumed an unfriendly attitude towards Russia, at that time still an unimportant power. In a letter written later in his reign he recalls the amicable relations that had existed between the Porte and Russia, and recommends his Ottoman merchants to buy furs and merchandise in Moscow. As Suleimans conquests naturally threw him into antagonism with the House of Hapsburg, it is desirable to review briefly the political conditions in the Holy Roman Empire at this time. The accession of Charles of Spain to the Imperial throne took place in October of the same year as Suleimans accession, 5/820. Handicapped in every possible way by the German princes, for whose safety and prosperity the emperor assumed the entire responsibility without receiving in return any equivalent whatever, Charles V presented a great contrast to Suleiman, whose slightest word was law throughout his extensive dominions. With the empire, Charles acquired the enmity of Francis I of France, his unsuccessful rival, and hereafter his constant foe. Another rival not outwardly so dangerous, but destined to be a great source of anxiety and weakness to the empire was Ferdinand, the emperors brother. Concerning him, Charles counsellor, de Chievres, is reported to have said to Charles, Do not fear the king of France nor any other prince except your brother. Ferdinands ambition had been early recognized. His grandfather, Ferdinand of Aragon, had attempted to construct an Italian kingdom for him, but failed. Charles, after his election to the Empire, tried to satisfy Ferdinands craving for power by conferring on him the old Austrian provinces, and further by marrying him to Anna, heiress of the kingdom of Hungary and Bohemia, whose child king, Lewis, was weak physically and not destined for a long reign. This opened to Ferdinand a large sphere of activity in the southeast, and brought him into direct contact with the steadily encroaching Suleiman; a sphere that effectually absorbed his energies and made him but a source of weakness to the Empire. Thus Charles V, in name the imperial ruler of Central Europe, was confronted with four rivals who desired to divide with him the supremacy; Francis I, a relentless foe; his brother Ferdinand, an ambitious claimant: the conquering Suleiman; and the Protestant Revolt. The weakness and disunion of Christendom was the strength of Suleiman, and he was far too shrewd not to trade on it. It had in fact been long since Europe had been sufficiently united to oppose with any vigor the oncoming Turks. The Popes of Rome had been the most persistent foes of Turkish advance in Europe; notably Calixtus III, who in 45/83 tried in vain to save Europe from Mohammeds conquering armies; Pius II, who having for his master thought the freeing of Europe from Islam, preached a general crusade, and even attempted to convert Mohammed by letter; Paul II, who gave lavish aid to Scanderbeg and the armies in Hungary and Albania in their struggle against Turkish invasion; Alexander VI, who held Prince Jem, the mutinous brother of Sultan Bayazid, as hostage for the friendliness of the sultan whom he attacked after Jems death; and Julius II, who planned a crusade early in the sixteenth century, but failed to execute it. All this time Turkish conquest continued practically unhindered. By the close of the fifteenth century the Turks were accepted as a permanent political factor in Europe. Nevertheless, when Charles became a candidate for election to the headship of the Holy Roman Empire, he emphasized his fitness for the high office by alleging that his vast possessions, united to the Imperial dignity, would enable him to oppose the Turks successfully. But the sudden rise of revolt within the Church tended to force the dread of Islam into the background, even in the face of the loss of Belgrad and Rhodes. At least such was the case with Charles V and the German princes; it was of necessity otherwise with little King Lewis, who saw with terror the preparations of the Turkish conquerors for war to the death with Hungary. As Suleimans conquests naturally threw him into antagonism with Austria, equally naturally he had common interests with Francis I. Friendly relations between the Porte and France were not unprecedented, although strongly disapproved by the more religious among the French. Commercial agreements had existed for some time between the two states. The accession of Francis I, January, 5/815/8, marked an epoch in the Eastern Question. Francis Oriental policy began on the conventional lines; he made an agreement with Leo X to drive the Turks from Europe but refused to subsidize Hungary in the interests of this purpose. The pope called for a truce in Europe and a crusade against the common enemy, but the death of Maximilian and the outbreak of the Protestant Revolt put a complete stop to this plan. The only result was the extension of the circle of European politics to include Eastern affairs and the Ottoman Empire, and to bring the Eastern Question home to all the European powers. Those who had been furthest away were now drawn in; France, Spain, and even England began to step within the circle of Eastern influence. The battle of Pavia marked a crisis in European affairs. The captivity of the French king, his falling into the hands of his bitterest foe, Charles of Hapsburg, destroyed any scruples that the French court had felt against seeking Turkish aid.""","""Ottoman Empire's political dynamics""","2003","""The Ottoman Empire, one of the most powerful and enduring empires in history, was characterized by a complex system of political dynamics that shaped its governance, administration, and interactions with its diverse subjects and neighboring powers. Understanding the political landscape of the Ottoman Empire requires delving into its key components, such as the Sultan's authority, the administrative structure, the role of institutions like the Divan and the military, as well as the relationship between the central government and the provinces.  At the helm of the Ottoman political system was the Sultan, who wielded absolute power as both the political and religious leader of the empire. The Sultan was seen as the Caliph, or the spiritual head of the Islamic world, adding a dimension of religious legitimacy to their rule. The Sultan's authority was symbolized by titles such as 'Shadow of God on Earth' and 'Sovereign of the Universe,' underscoring the grandeur and absolute nature of their power. Despite the Sultan's overarching authority, governance in the Ottoman Empire was not solely based on autocracy; rather, it incorporated elements of consultation and consensus-building.  The Sultan governed with the assistance of various institutions, the most important of which was the Divan. The Divan served as the imperial council where high-ranking officials, known as Viziers, advised the Sultan on matters of state. The Viziers oversaw different governmental departments, such as finance, justice, and military affairs, ensuring the smooth functioning of the empire. The Ottoman bureaucracy was meritocratic, allowing individuals of diverse backgrounds, including Christians and Jews, to rise to prominent positions based on competency rather than birth.  Another crucial component of the Ottoman political system was the military. The Ottoman army, known as the Janissaries, played a pivotal role in both protecting the empire's borders and maintaining internal stability. The Janissaries were elite soldiers who were recruited as children, converted to Islam, and trained to be loyal to the Sultan above all. However, their power and influence could also pose a challenge to the central government, as they often had their own agenda and could influence political decisions.  The Ottoman Empire was not a monolithic entity but a diverse collection of territories, each with its own unique characteristics and challenges. The provinces, or eyalets, were governed by appointed officials known as governors or beylerbeyis, who were responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and upholding the Sultan's authority. The relationship between the central government in Istanbul and the provinces was crucial for the empire's stability and prosperity. Strong governors could help maintain control and ensure loyalty, while weak or rebellious ones could spark unrest and threaten the empire's cohesion.  The Ottoman Empire's political dynamics were also influenced by external factors, such as interactions with neighboring powers and European states. The empire's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa meant that it was constantly engaged in diplomacy, trade, and conflict with other states. The Ottomans' successful expansion and military prowess made them a formidable force in the region, but challenges from rival powers, such as the Safavids, Mamluks, and later European nations, posed threats to their dominance.  Over time, the Ottoman Empire faced internal strife, economic challenges, and territorial losses that eroded its power and ultimately led to its dissolution in the early 20th century. The intricate political dynamics that once sustained the empire became strained as corruption, inefficiency, and external pressures took their toll. The legacy of the Ottoman Empire continues to shape the geopolitics of the modern Middle East and Southeast Europe, serving as a reminder of the complexities and nuances of political power and governance in a diverse and multiethnic empire.""","743"
"Tebb William","""Special care is taken to test the reality of death in still-born infants, and efforts are made to revive them, as well as all other cases of seeming death. In cases of women dying during advanced pregnancy, the infant must be roused by artificial respiration, in order to restore animation if possible. The process for obtaining a delay for burial is intricate and cumbersome, and to a foreigner unaccustomed to the language and the local usages the chances would be against securing such a permit before the time allowed for burial had transpired.. Mortuaries are connected with all the churches, cemeteries, and some of the hospitals, and are growing in favour in the country places; but as yet they are unprovided with any appliances for the resuscitation of the apparently dead, or for the prevention of premature burials. No corpse, however, is allowed to be taken to a mortuary before it has been inspected, and a death-certificate issued by a qualified physician; but, when this is done, death is considered absolute. No corpse is allowed to remain in any church, chapel, or mortuary longer than seven days after supposed death, without special permission. Coffins that contain bodies which have died from infectious diseases must be so indicated, and cannot be opened in the mortuaries. As a rule, bodies are kept seventy-two hours before burial. The signs that are considered sufficient to establish death are the glazed appearance of the eyes, livid spots on the skin, and muscular rigidity. In doubtful cases, the time before burial can be extended by authority of the Board of Health, of which the Police Director is a member.. Burials usually do not take place until twenty-four hours after death. For example, if a death takes place about four p.m., the burial is made late in the following afternoon. In time of epidemic, bodies are hurried to the cemeteries, where depositories are provided, which are under the care of watchers until the expiration of twenty-four hours after death. The certificate of a reputable physician as to death is sufficient to authorise burial. Relatives or friends usually remain with the body until burial, excepting in cases when judicial proceedings are held over it to determine the circumstances of the death.. There are no laws in Ireland regarding the disposal of the dead, but the Sanitary Acts of the United Kingdom can be applied in any case within a reasonable period, on the ground of public health. There is no fixed period for keeping a body before burial. The Roman Catholics usually bury on the third or fourth day after death; but in some districts custom sanctions burial within twenty-four or thirty-six hours. Local burial authorities sometimes require a medical certificate before burial, but, there being no legal obligation for it, this is often omitted. In cases of suicide, sudden death, or death by violence, the Coroner holds an inquest, and gives a certificate accordingly. There are no dead-houses in Ireland, where bodies may be observed for a period of time before burial. Concerning burials in England, see Glens Burial Acts for the general burial practice; also Regulations for Wilton Cemetery. THE. In the United States of America, as a rule, everything relative to the disposal of the dead is regulated by local Boards of Health, as authorised by State laws. A burial cannot take place without a certificate from a legally licensed physician, which must state the cause of death; the place and time when it occurred; the full name; age; sex; colour; occupation; birth-place; names and birth-places of both parents. There are no laws or regulations that require the inspection of the body to verify the fact of death (the certificate, as in England, as to the cause is considered sufficient for this purpose), and no time is fixed when a body must, or must not, be buried. This is regulated by, and left to, the convenience of the family of the deceased, by the season of the year, by the opinion of the attending physician, etc. But the Health Officers can order the burial whenever, in their opinion, the public health requires it. As a rule, burials after supposed death are made sooner in the South, and among the poor, than in the North, and among the well-to-do classes. In remote unsettled regions burials not seldom take place without these formalities, and they are often carried out in a hasty manner; but usually they do not take place till three days after supposed death, and sometimes, particularly in cold weather, a longer time is allowed. All large cemeteries have chambers for the temporary deposit of bodies, but they are not under observation, as it is taken for granted that they are dead. F. THE OF. R. J., in his standard work on Biblisch-talmudische Medicin, Riga and Leipzig, 85/80-0, gives, in pp. -5/8 of the concluding dead body was an unclean thing, including those dead in the tent and on the battlefield. Touching a corpse involved purification and separation for seven days. This ordinance is supposed to have had a sanitary motive, having probably originated with cases of infectious disease. There is only one Biblical ordinance as to early burial, and that is indubitably restricted to persons executed for crime: Deut. xxi. 2, 3, And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree, his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that be visited diligently until three days after death. (The references to the Talmud are: Semachoth; Moedkaton,; Sabbat 5/81, 5/82; Sanhedrin 6a.) Wunderbar admits that there had been cases of premature burial among the Jews, but he asserts their extreme rarity, and doubts the authenticity of most of the traditional or historical cases in general. In Jewish circles in Germany towards the end of last century there was much controversy as to the inexpediency of the practice of early burial. In the Berlinische Monatschrift for April, 787, p. 29, (cited by Marcus Herz, Ueber die fruhe Beerdigung der Juden, Berlin, 788, p.,) there is printed a letter from Moses Mendelssohn to the Jews of Mecklenburg, in which he advises them to keep their dead unburied for three days. I know well, he adds, that you will not follow my advice; for the might of custom is great. Nay, I shall perhaps appear to you as a heretic on account of my counsel. All the same, I have freed my conscience from guilt. The above-cited essay by Dr. Marcus Herz, of Berlin, arguing against the Jewish practice, called forth a reply by Dr. Marx, of Hanover, who was of opinion that the burial might safely proceed after the body had been left on the bed for three hours, and had then been pronounced lifeless by the medical attendant, according to the practice in that part of the country. To that Dr. Herz rejoined, in a second edition, that the medical attendant was no better judge than an ordinary man, inasmuch as all experimental tests were fallacious, and decomposition the only sure sign. He cites the following statement by an experienced Jewish physician, Dr. Hirschberg, of Konigsberg (from the Jewish periodical, Sammler, vol. ii., p. 5/83):-- I have practised medicine for forty years, and have always grieved over the practice amongst us of too hasty burial of the dead--on the day of decease. It happened once in my practice that a woman lay for dead three days and then awoke and revived. At first I would not allow the body to be moved from the bed, but the undertakers men violently resisted me, taking up the body and laying it on the ground. According to their custom, they would have buried it the same day, had I not earnestly called out to them: Beware lest you do lay her in the ground this day! She is still alive, and the blame will be on you. I had her covered with warm, woollen clothes; on the following morning some signs of life were manifest; she lay still, and gradually awoke out of her death-slumber.""","""Burial practices and regulations.""","1736","""Burial practices and regulations play a significant role in preserving the dignity of the deceased, honoring cultural traditions, and ensuring public health and safety. Across different societies and over time, burial customs have varied widely, reflecting religious beliefs, cultural norms, and legal requirements. Understanding the complexities of burial practices and regulations can help us appreciate the reverence and respect that transcends beyond life.  Burial practices encompass a broad spectrum of rituals and traditions that surround the act of laying a body to rest. These practices can range from simple to elaborate ceremonies, varying by culture, religion, and personal preferences. In some societies, burial rituals involve elaborate ceremonies, chanting, offerings, and processionals, while in others, a more subdued and solemn approach is adopted. These customs serve to not only honor the deceased but also provide solace and closure to the bereaved.  Religious beliefs often heavily influence burial practices. For example, in Christianity, burial is seen as a way to honor the deceased and express faith in the resurrection, while in Hinduism, cremation is the preferred method as it is believed to release the soul from the cycle of rebirth. Similarly, Islamic traditions dictate swift burial (preferably within 24 hours of death) without embalming or cremation, emphasizing simplicity and respect for the deceased.  Cultural norms also shape burial practices. For instance, some cultures bury their dead facing a specific direction, while others use grave goods or adornments to accompany the departed to the afterlife. In certain indigenous communities, burial sites are chosen based on spiritual significance or ancestral connections, highlighting the deep reverence for the land and ancestors.  In modern times, burial practices are also influenced by practical considerations such as environmental impact, land scarcity, and public health concerns. With the rise of cremation, natural burials, and other alternative methods, individuals are exploring ways to reduce the ecological footprint of traditional burial practices. Natural burials, for example, involve interring bodies in biodegradable materials in a natural setting, promoting conservation and sustainability.  To regulate the diverse practices surrounding burial, legal frameworks and regulations have been established in many countries. These laws govern various aspects of burial, including cemetery management, embalming procedures, cremation practices, exhumation, and the handling of human remains. Regulations ensure that burials are conducted in a respectful, safe, and environmentally responsible manner.  Cemeteries are often subject to zoning laws and maintenance requirements to uphold public health standards and preserve the sanctity of burial grounds. Regulations also address issues such as burial plot ownership, the handling of cremated remains, and the transportation of bodies across borders. By enforcing these regulations, authorities aim to protect the rights of the deceased, maintain the dignity of burial practices, and safeguard public well-being.  In conclusion, burial practices and regulations transcend mere physical acts of interment; they encapsulate cultural heritage, religious beliefs, environmental consciousness, and legal considerations. By understanding and respecting the intricacies of burial customs, we honor the memory of the departed, acknowledge the diversity of human experiences, and uphold the values of compassion and dignity in both life and death.""","625"
"Ringrose Hyacinthe",""". Moral impediments. No person who has taken holy orders which involve a solemn vow to celibacy can contract a valid marriage. Marriages between Christians and Jews are forbidden. AND.--Marriage is forbidden between ascendants and descendants, between full or half brothers and sisters, between first cousins and between uncles and nieces or aunts and nephews. The relationship may arise from legitimate or illegitimate birth. For Jews, however, the impediment of consanguinity extends no further in the collateral line than to marriage between brother and sister or between a woman and her nephew or grandnephew. A Roman Catholic is expressly forbidden to marry a divorced party until after the death of the latter's former consort..--A valid marriage can take place only after formal publication of the banns and the solemn declaration of consent. Banns are published by announcing the coming marriage together with the full names of both parties, their birthplace, status and residence, on three consecutive Sundays or holidays. In the case of Jews the banns must be published on three consecutive Saturdays or feast days..--The solemn declaration of consent must generally be given before the spiritual pastor of one of the parties or before his representative. Two witnesses are necessary. A civil marriage in which the solemn declaration of consent is given before the chief administrative official of the district, in the presence of two witnesses and a sworn secretary, is obligatory if neither party belongs to a legally recognized religious sect..--The marriage of an Austrian subject in a foreign country is treated as valid in Austria if the marriage was concluded according to the laws of such foreign country, and provided that such marriage was not in contravention of the Austrian law which accepts the Roman Catholic dogma of the indissolubility of marriage except by death of one of the parties..--Such children are fully legitimatized by the subsequent marriage of their parents..--As we have noted before between Roman Catholics the bond of marriage cannot be dissolved by divorce. This rule applies even if one of the parties is converted after marriage to a non-Catholic sect. The Austrian law provides a way by which some Roman Catholic marriages may be provisionally dissolved after what is termed a 'legal declaration of death.' If eighty years have elapsed since the birth of an absent spouse, and his or her place of residence has been unknown for ten years; if an absent spouse has not been heard from in thirty years; or if a spouse has been missing for three years, and was last heard of under circumstances leaving little doubt as to his or her death, then an action can be instituted to have the absentee legally declared to be dead. Such a declaration of death will legally dissolve the marriage, leaving the spouse of the missing party free to marry again. However, should the absentee spouse ever reappear, the declaration of death and the new marriage lose all legal effect..--Non-Catholic Christians may obtain absolute divorce for the following causes:. Conviction of adultery, or of a crime the penalty for which could be a prison sentence of five years.. Malicious abandonment.. Severe cruelty.. Conduct endangering the life or health.. Invincible aversion on account of which both parties desire a divorce. This need not be a mutual aversion, but it must be shown to be actual and lasting. For this cause an absolute divorce is granted only after a temporary separation from bed and board has been decreed, and the parties appear to be irreconciliable. OF.--The woman retains the name of her husband, and both parties may remarry, with the exception that a guilty party may not marry his or her accomplice. The guilty party loses all rights and privileges in the property of the innocent party. As to the custody of children the court has authority to make such order as the facts and justice may require..--Jews in Austria may obtain absolute divorce under special regulations adapted from the Mosaic law and rabbinical jurisprudence. Marriage may be absolutely dissolved by means of a bill of divorcement given by the man to the woman, with the mutual agreement of both parties. This cannot take effect at once, but there must be three attempts at reconciliation, either by the rabbi or by the court, or by both. The Austrian law also permits a divorce among Jews for the proven adultery of the wife, in which case he can give her a bill of divorcement without her consent. A Jewish woman cannot obtain a divorce because of the adultery of her husband..--A judicial separation may be granted for the following causes:. By mutual consent.. Conviction of either spouse for adultery or a crime.. Malicious abandonment.. Conduct endangering the life or health of spouse seeking relief.. Incurable disease united with danger of contagion.. Cruel and abusive treatment. XI. AND LAWS. In Hungary proper and Transylvania, together with Fiume and certain parts of the Military Boundary, the marriage law of 894, supplemented by the Civil Registration Act of the same year, is in operation for all citizens, without regard to religious sect. In Croatia and Slavonia, which, although legally parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, are autonomous in domestic affairs; three separate systems of marriage regulation are in force governing, respectively, the Catholics, the Oriental Greeks, and the Protestants and Jews. AND.--Civil marriage is the only form recognized by law..--A man cannot marry before the conclusion of his eighteenth year; a woman, before the conclusion of her sixteenth year. A minor cannot conclude a marriage without the consent of his or her legal representative..--. Marriage is forbidden between ascendants and descendants.. Between brother and sister.. Between brother or sister and offspring of brother or sister.. Marriage between a person who has been previously married and a blood relative in direct line of that person's former consort is forbidden.. First cousins may not conclude marriage, except on dispensation from the Minister of Justice.. No person may conclude a marriage with any one who has been legally sentenced for a murder or a murderous assault committed on the former's consort, even if the sentence has not yet entered into effect.. No one may conclude a marriage without the consent of his ecclesiastical superiors if he has taken ecclesiastical orders or vows which, according to the law of the church to which he belongs, prevent his marrying.. So long as the guardianship continues, marriage is prohibited between a guardian or his offspring and the ward..--Before a marriage can be lawfully celebrated it must be preceded by the publication of banns. This publication must be made in the commune or communes where the parties ordinarily reside. Publication is made by posting an official notice for fourteen days in the office of the registrar and in a public place in the communal building..--Marriage is, as a rule, to be solemnized before the registrar of the district in which at least one of the parties has his or her residence or domicile. At the celebration of marriage the parties are obliged to appear together before the officiating magistrate, and in the presence of two competent witnesses declare that they conclude a marriage with each other. After such declaration the magistrate declares the couple to be legally married. The registrar is required by law to enter a record of the marriage on his official register and to give a formal marriage certificate to the parties..--In general, for a marriage contracted by a Hungarian citizen in a foreign country to be recognized as valid in Hungary, the parties to the marriage must satisfy the requirements of their respective States as to age and legal capacity and must be free from all other impediments contained in the law of either State. The Hungarian citizen must comply with the regulations of the Hungarian law regarding publication. Besides this, the foreign marriage must be concluded in accordance with all the requirements of the country where it was celebrated..--If at the time such children were born the parents could legally have married each other then the subsequent marriage of the parents makes legitimate the children. OF.--Marriages may be annulled because of the violation of the various provisions of law regarding marriage impediments or the formalities necessary to conclude marriage. AND.--Marriage can be legally dissolved only by a judicial decree on certain grounds specified by law. These grounds are of two classes--absolute and relative. The following causes constitute absolute grounds for divorce:. Adultery.. Crime against nature.. Bigamy.. Wilful abandonment without just cause.. Attempt upon the life or wilful and serious maltreatment such as to endanger bodily safety or health.. Sentence to death or to at least five years in prison or the penitentiary. For all of the above causes the court must grant an absolute divorce if the allegations are proven. Divorce may also be granted on the following 'relative grounds' if the court, after careful consideration of the individuality and characteristics of the parties, is satisfied that the facts warrant the desired relief:. Serious violation of marital duties.. Inducing, or attempting to induce, a child belonging to the family to commission of a criminal act or to an immoral manner of life.. Persistent immoral conduct.""","""Marriage laws and regulations""","1830","""Marriage laws and regulations are a crucial aspect of society, governing the legal union between individuals. These laws vary significantly across countries and regions, reflecting cultural norms, historical traditions, and legal frameworks. Understanding the nuances of marriage laws is essential for ensuring a smooth and legally binding union.  One of the fundamental aspects of marriage laws is the legal age requirement for marriage. Most jurisdictions have set a minimum age for individuals to enter into a marriage contract. This is aimed at protecting minors from exploitation and ensuring that individuals are mature enough to make such a significant decision. Violating age requirements can lead to the invalidation of the marriage or legal consequences for those involved.  Another crucial element of marriage laws is the recognition of different types of marriages. While monogamous marriages are the most common form, some countries recognize polygamous or polyamorous relationships. However, these types of marriages often come with specific legal considerations, such as inheritance rights, divorce procedures, and child custody arrangements. In contrast, same-sex marriages have gained increasing recognition in many countries, following years of legal battles for equal rights.  Marriage laws also regulate the validity of marriages, outlining the requirements for a marriage to be legally recognized. These requirements typically include obtaining a marriage license, solemnizing the marriage through a ceremony or registration, and having the consent of both parties entering the union. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the marriage being considered void or voidable under the law.  Divorce laws are another critical aspect of marriage regulations, detailing the procedures for ending a marriage legally. Grounds for divorce can vary, including factors such as adultery, abandonment, abuse, or irreconcilable differences. Legal frameworks also address issues like division of assets, alimony, child support, and custody arrangements, aiming to protect the rights of both parties and any children involved.  Marriage laws also encompass the concept of marital property, which defines how assets acquired during the marriage are divided in the event of divorce or death. Depending on the jurisdiction, marital property may be subject to equal division, or certain assets may be considered separate property and not subject to division. Understanding these regulations is essential for ensuring fair treatment and protecting individual interests.  In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of prenuptial agreements in marriage laws. Prenups allow couples to establish financial agreements regarding assets, debts, and property division in the event of divorce. While once viewed as a tool for the wealthy, prenuptial agreements are now more widely accepted and can provide clarity and peace of mind for couples entering into marriage.  Overall, marriage laws and regulations play a vital role in shaping the institution of marriage and protecting the rights of individuals involved. By understanding and complying with these laws, couples can ensure a legally sound and stable union, while legal frameworks evolve to reflect changing societal norms and values.""","567"
"Wharton James","""On the other hand, it is conceivable that Virginia boats caught 'white salmon' in the Atlantic Ocean. 'Conyfish' can mean several different fishes, so that it is not possible to be sure what Smith had in mind; so with 'brit.' 'Crevise' is an older name for crawfish. Seals still make rare appearances in the bay. As for the stingrays, he spoke from experience; he was spiked by one. Almost all of his list are still being caught off Jamestown. The 'St. George's dragon' or sea horse, is among them. There are many more varieties of fish caught by Virginia fishermen today than were ever mentioned in Colonial records. This is due to superior gear and the more intensive use of it. Captain Christopher Newport was among the earliest observers confirming Smith. He wrote in 607: The main river abounds with sturgeon, very large and excellent good, having also at the mouth of every brook and in every creek both store and exceedingly good fish of divers kinds. In the large sounds near the sea are multitudes of fish, banks of oysters, and many great crabs rather better, in fact, than ours and able to suffice four men. And within sight of land into the sea we expect at time of year to have a good fishing for cod, as both at our entering we might perceive by palpable conjectures, seeing the cod follow the ship. as also out of my own experience not far off to the northward the fishing I found in my first voyage to Virginia. The commodities of the country, what they are in else, is not much to be regarded, the inhabitants having no concern with any nation, no respect of profit. Yet this for the present, by the consent of all our seamen, merely fishing for sturgeon cannot be worth less than,00 a year, leaving herring and cod as possibilities. We have a good fishing for mussels which resemble mother-of-pearl, and if the pearl we have seen in the king's ears and about their necks come from these shells we know the banks. The crab 'able to suffice four men' could scarcely have been other than the horseshoe. It has never been considered a delicacy. It is usually by contraries that the truth is determined. Even in the midst of the apparent plenty of fish, fishing crews sometimes came home empty-handed after continued effort. Often storms interfered. From personal experience John Smith was able to sound the warning about Chesapeake weather: Our mast and sail blew overboard and such mighty waves overraked us in that small barge that with great danger we kept her from sinking by freeing out the water. The winds are variable, but the like thunder and lightning to purify the air I have seldom either seen or heard in Europe. As if struck by the helplessness of the settlers, a compassionate chief extended aid to them in 608. A letter from Francis Perkins tells the story: So excessive are the frosts that one night the river froze over almost from bank to bank in front of our harbour, although it was there as wide as that of London. There died from the frost some fish in the river, which when taken out after the frost was over, were very good and so fat that they could be fried in their own fat without adding any butter or such thing. Their own great emperor or the wuarravance, which is the name of their kings, has sent some of his people that they may teach us how to sow the grain of this country and to make certain traps with which they are going to fish. A letter from the Council in Virginia to the Virginia Company in London in 610 shows that such favors were returned: Whilst we were fishing divers Indians came down from the woods unto us and. I gave unto them such fish as we took. for indeed at this time of the year they live poor, their corn being but newly put into the ground and their own store spent. Oysters and crabs and such fish as they take in their weirs is their best relief. Oysters occurred in vast banks and shoals within sight of the Jamestown fort. During the 609-0 'starving time' a minimum force was retained at the settlement while everyone else was turned out to forage as best he could. Most sought the oyster grounds where they ate oysters nine weeks, a diet varied only by a pitifully negligible allowance of corn meal. In the words of one of the foragers, 'this kind of feeding caused all our skin to peel off from head to foot as if we had been dead.' The arrival of supplies ended the ordeal. But soon hunger descended again and the oyster beds would have been the natural recourse if it had not been winter and the water too cold to wade in. So the oysters were no help. That conscientious reporter, William Strachey, wrote in 610: In this desolation and misery our Governor found the condition and state of the Colony. Nor was there at the fort, as they whom we found related unto us, any means to take fish; neither sufficient seine, nor other convenient net, and yet of their need, there was not one eye of sturgeon yet come into the river. The river which was wont before this time of the year to be plentiful of sturgeon had not now a fish to be seen in it, and albeit we laboured and hauled our net twenty times day and night, yet we took not so much as would content half the fishermen. Our Governor therefore, sent away his long boat to coast the river downward as far as Point Comfort, and from thence to Cape Henry and Cape Charles, and all within the bay, which after a seven nights trial and travail, returned without any fruits of their labours, scarce getting so much fish as served their own company. And, likewise, because at the Lord Governor and Captain General's first coming, there was found in our own river no store of fish after many trials, the Lord Governor and Captain General dispatched in the Virginia, with instructions, the seventeenth of June, 610, Robert Tyndall, master of the De la Warre, to fish unto, all along, and between Cape Henry and Cape Charles within the bay. Nor was the Lord Governor and Captain General in the meanwhile idle at the fort, but every day and night he caused the nets to be hauled, sometimes a dozen times one after another. But it pleased not God so to bless our labours that we did at any time take one quarter so much as would give unto our people one pound at a meal apiece, by which we might have better husbanded our peas and oatmeal, notwithstanding the great store we now saw daily in our river. But let the blame of this lie where it is, both upon our nets and the unskilfulness of our men to lay them. The matter of sturgeon was of prime importance not only for subsistence but for export, particularly of the roe. Caviar was in great demand in England. But with uncertainty as to when the sturgeon would appear in the river, plus hot weather, plus feeble facilities, the growth of the industry was impeded. When tobacco, first commercially grown by John Rolfe, appeared on the scene in 612 and proved to be a sure money maker, the export of sturgeon products came to a standstill. It was having hard going anyway. Complaints from England regarding quality were familiar enough. According to Lord De La Warr in 610, on the subject, 'Virginia Commodities': Sturgeon which was last sent came ill-conditioned, not being well boiled. If it were cut in small pieces and powdered, put up in cask, the heads pickled by themselves, and sent here, it would do far better. Roes of the said sturgeon make caviar according to instructions formerly given. Sounds of the said sturgeon will make isinglass according to the same instructions. Isinglass is worth here 3s. d. per 00 pounds, and caviar well conditioned is worth 0 per 00. Other instances stressed the undependable fishing. Lord De La Warr wrote to the Earl of Salisbury in England in 610: 'I sent fishermen out to provide fish for our men, to save other provision, but they had ill success.' Captain Samuel Argall was specially commissioned by the authorities in England to deep-sea fish for the benefit of the Colony. After ranging over a wide area between Bermuda and Canada, he reported in 610:. The weather continuing very foggy, thick, and rainy, about five of the clock it began to cease and then we began to fish and so continued until seven of the clock in between thirty and forty fathoms, and then we could fish no longer. So having gotten between twenty and thirty cods we left for that night, and at five of the clock, the 6th, in the morning we began to fish again and so continued until ten of the clock, and then it would fish no longer, in which time we had taken near one hundred cods and a couple of halibuts. Then I tried whether there were any fish there or not, and I found reasonable good store there. So I stayed there fishing till the 2th of August, and then finding that the fishing did fail, I thought good to return to the island. Captain Argall also offered his opinion of the usefulness of the islands off Virginia's seacoast peninsula, later known as the Eastern Shore: Salt might easily be made there, if there were any ponds digged, for that I found salt kernel where the water had overflowed in certain places. Here also is great store of fish, both shellfish and others. The root of the trouble, so far as local fishing conditions were concerned, was the lack of adequate equipment together with ignorance of its proper use. Perhaps the ease with which fish were caught at certain times had spoiled the hardy settlers. A low opinion of their attitude in this vital pursuit came from Sir Thomas Gates in 610: A colony is therefore denominated because they should be coloni, the tillers of the earth and stewards of fertility. Our mutinous loiterers would not sow with providence and therefore they reaped the fruits of far too dear bought repentance.""","""Fishing in Colonial Virginia""","2123","""Fishing in Colonial Virginia played a pivotal role in the daily lives of the early settlers and indigenous populations. The abundant waterways, including the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, provided a vital source of food and economic sustenance for Virginia's inhabitants. With the rich marine resources available, fishing became not only a means of survival but also a significant aspect of the social, cultural, and economic fabric of the colony.  The Native American tribes that inhabited the region before European contact had a deep and intricate knowledge of fishing techniques and practices. They utilized both freshwater and saltwater resources, employing methods such as netting, trapping, spearing, and hook-and-line fishing to sustain themselves. These indigenous fishing practices were vital to their way of life, ensuring a reliable food source and supporting trade among various tribes.  Upon the arrival of English colonists in the early 17th century, fishing became integral to the survival of the settlers in the New World. Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America established in 1607, relied heavily on fishing to supplement their agricultural efforts. The colonists quickly learned from the Native Americans about the bountiful resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, turning to fishing as a means of sustenance.  One of the most popular methods of fishing in Colonial Virginia was using nets. Seines, gill nets, and dip nets were common tools employed by both Native Americans and European settlers to catch fish in rivers, streams, and estuaries. Seining involved dragging a net through the water to capture schools of fish, while gill nets were set in a way that allowed fish to swim into the mesh but prevented them from escaping. Dip nets were handheld nets used to scoop fish out of the water, particularly in shallow areas.  In addition to net fishing, angling with hook and line was prevalent among the colonists. Fishing with a simple hook, line, and bait was a popular pastime and provided a more targeted approach to catching fish. Anglers would use a variety of natural baits such as worms, insects, or pieces of meat to attract fish like perch, catfish, bass, and sturgeon.  Shellfish harvesting was also a significant part of the fishing economy in Colonial Virginia. Oysters, clams, and crabs were plentiful in the brackish waters of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, providing a valuable source of protein and nutrients for the colonists. Oysters, in particular, became a staple food for both the settlers and enslaved populations, with oyster beds being a crucial resource for sustenance and trade.  The importance of fishing extended beyond mere subsistence in Colonial Virginia. As the colony grew and prospered, fishing became a thriving industry that supported trade and commerce. Fishermen would often salt, smoke, or dry their catch to preserve it for transportation to markets in the colony and abroad. Salted fish, such as shad and herring, were in high demand in Europe and the Caribbean, leading to a lucrative export market for Virginia's fishing industry.  The waterways of Colonial Virginia also provided opportunities for leisure and recreation through recreational fishing. Wealthier colonists would engage in recreational angling as a form of entertainment, social gathering, and sport. Fishing retreats and competitions were common, bringing together individuals from different social classes to bond over a shared passion for the sport.  Despite the abundance of marine resources in Colonial Virginia, overfishing and environmental degradation began to take a toll on the ecosystem. The unregulated and intensive fishing practices of the colonists led to declines in fish populations and the degradation of habitats. This unsustainable exploitation of resources would have long-term consequences for the marine ecosystem and the livelihoods of those dependent on fishing.  In conclusion, fishing in Colonial Virginia was a multifaceted activity that sustained the early settlers, supported trade and commerce, and fostered social connections among diverse populations. From the traditional fishing practices of Native American tribes to the commercial fishing enterprises of European colonists, the waters of Virginia played a central role in shaping the colony's economy and culture. While fishing provided a vital source of food and income for the inhabitants of Colonial Virginia, it also highlighted the complex relationship between humans and the environment, underscoring the importance of sustainable fishing practices for future generations.""","866"
"Elliot G F Scott George Francis Scott ","""The influence of forests and timber on the daily life of mankind is a most romantic and interesting chapter in history. Every savage tribe, every race of man, however degraded or backward, is acquainted with fire. Fuel is therefore a necessity of existence for all savages, and not merely for cooking. There is a very interesting passage in London's The Call of the Wild, when the Dog 'Buck' in his dreams remembers a hairy man crouching over the fire with Buck's ancestor at his feet, whilst in the darkness all round them the firelight is reflected from eyes of wolves, bears, and even more terrible and dangerous brutes which have now happily vanished from the world. For protection at night fire was an absolute necessity. Even at that long-distant period, therefore, man had commenced to attack the forest. Unless one has had to tend a wood fire for twelve hours, it is difficult to realize what a quantity is required. To prepare fire was a long, laborious, and difficult operation; one piece of wood was placed on the ground and held in position by the toes, a pointed stick was taken between the two palms of the hand and twirled vigorously round and round until the heat was enough to ignite a piece of rotten wood placed as tinder. Therefore smouldering branches were kept always burning, as they are to-day amongst the Fuegians and some other savages. It was a sacred duty to watch this fire, and the was entrusted with the task was very probably put to death if she failed. From this very ancient savage custom probably arose the cult of the Vestal Virgins in Ancient Rome. It will be remembered that they were obliged to keep the sacred fire always burning, and were put to death if they misbehaved. The fire was never allowed to go out during the whole of Roman history, and the custom has been even preserved in some Roman Catholic convents and chapels. Another very important factor in savage life was the canoe or piroque necessary for fishing or to cross lakes and rivers. The first chantey of Rudyard Kipling has a probable theory, and is a beautiful account of how man first thought of using a floating log. They hollowed out the log and 'dug out' the canoe, by first lighting a fire on it and then scraping away the cinders; then the sides were pressed out, and it was trimmed and straightened to the right shape. All this was the idea of some paleolithic genius far more persevering and ingenious than any marine architect of our own days. Seven Seas. 'Birchbark' canoes are not so common as Dug-outs. The tree, the White or Paper Birch, is found in Canada and the Northern United States; those Indians who discovered that the light, waterproof cork-bark could be fashioned into a canoe made a very great discovery, and indeed it was their canoes that made travel or exploration possible in North America. When man began to long for a settled permanent home, it was absolutely necessary to find a way of living in safety. Wolves, bears, hyenas and other animals were abundant; neighbours of his own or other tribes were more ferocious and more dangerous than wild beasts. Some neolithic genius imagined an artificial island made of logs in the midst of a lake or inaccessible swamp. Such were the lake dwellings which persisted into historic times, and which are indeed still in existence in some parts of the earth. Munro, Lake Dwellings. The trees were abundant; they could be felled by the help of fire and an axe, and the lake dwelling gave a secure defence. The wood of some of the piles supporting the great villages in Switzerland seems to be still sound, though it has been under water for many centuries. Some villages are said to have required hundreds of thousands of trees. The forest afforded man almost everything that he used, bows and arrows, shelter, fuel, and even part of his food. Nuts and fruits would be collected and when possible stored. In seasons of famine, they used even to eat the delicate inside portion of the bark of trees. But as soon as the first half-civilized men began to keep cattle, sheep, and especially goats, more serious inroads still were made upon the forest. Where such animals are allowed to graze there is no chance for wood to to-day. There are in places very ancient forests. A few miles from Retford are considerable remains of Sherwood Forest, which is for ever associated with that genial bandit Robin Hood. One huge or used to have a keeper always on guard and paid by Lord Manvers, but there are hundreds of aged oaks all round it. Then there is the Knightwood Oak and some other ancients in the New Forest. But it is not certain that these even date so far back as the time of Canute, for so far as the New Forest is concerned, it seems that this was formed either by Canute or by William I. The Saxons seem to have destroyed most of the English forests. In Scotland oak forest existed as far north as the Island of Lewis, in Caithness, Dornoch, Cromarty, and along Loch Ness, as well as in every county south of these. The deer forests and grouse moors, now desolate, whaup-haunted muir-land and peat mosses, were flourishing woods of magnificent Scots fir at no very distant period. They ascended the hills on the Cairngorms to 400 or 5/800 feet, and in Yorkshire to 400 feet. Niven, Bot. Section British Association, 901. Boyd Watt, Cairngorm Club Journal, vol. iv. No. 0, January, 903; Smith, Lewis, Roy. Geog. Soc. Journal. Even in remote historical times, such as those of Canute, the forests had become seriously and dangerously destroyed. This king was apparently the first to artificially protect the woods as a hunting preserve. He was followed by William the Conqueror and other sovereigns. The game preserves of the landed proprietors to-day are, of course, the remains of the same custom. Fortunately, however, we do not kill poachers or cut off their right hands, and we do not cut off the forepaws of poaching dogs, as used to be done in medieval days. This connexion of forests with game no doubt prevented the entire disappearance of wood, but when, as is the case in England, the comfort of pheasants is thought of more importance than the scientific cultivation of forests, the result is often very unfortunate. The use and value of timber is, however, too important a matter to take up at the end of a chapter. IV ON The forests of the Coal Age--Monkey-puzzle and ginkgo--Wood, its uses, colour, and smell--Lasting properties of wood--Jarrah and deodar--Teak--Uses of birch--Norwegian barques--Destruction of wood in America--Paper from wood pulp--Forest fires--Arid lands once fertile--Britain to be again covered by forests--Vanished country homes--Ashes at farmhouses--Yews in churchyards--History of Man versus Woods in Britain. What was the first tree like? That is a very difficult question to answer. Perhaps the first forests were those of the great coal period, of which the remains, buried for untold ages in the earth, became the coal which we now burn. The flames and red-glowing heat of a fire are the work of the sunlight which fell in these long-past ages through a steamy, misty atmosphere, upon these weird, grotesque vegetables, unlike anything which now exists upon the earth. Their nearest allies amongst living plants are the little club-mosses which creep over the peat and through the heather in alpine districts. Of course no one can say exactly what these coal forests were like. But although some modern authorities have questioned the general accuracy of the descriptions of Heer and others, yet, as they have not given anything better in the way of description, we shall endeavour to describe them according to our own beliefs, and as they probably existed in the Lanarkshire coalfield and other places in Britain. In that gloomy mirk of the Carboniferous epoch, an have dimly perceived huge trunks rising to sixty or eighty feet and divided at the top into a very few branches. All branches were covered over by comparatively quite small leaves.""","""Forests and their historical significance""","1742","""Forests have held a significant place in human history, serving as more than just a collection of trees but as integral components of our social, economic, and cultural development. From ancient civilizations to modern-day conservation efforts, forests have played a crucial role in shaping the world as we know it.  In the annals of history, forests have been revered and feared, revered for their majestic beauty, abundant resources, and as spiritual sanctuaries, but also feared for the unknown dangers lurking within their depths. Early human societies depended on forests for sustenance, shelter, and tools. The first human settlements emerged near forests, providing a vital source of food from hunting and gathering, as well as protection from harsh elements.  As human civilizations evolved, so did the utilization of forests. The advent of agriculture saw forests being cleared for cultivation, leading to vast swathes of land being transformed into farmland. The depletion of forests for agricultural purposes caused ecological imbalances, leading to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and disrupted ecosystems. The historical legacy of deforestation serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of sustainable forest management practices.  In addition to their practical uses, forests have played a profound cultural role in societies across the globe. Many ancient civilizations viewed forests as sacred spaces inhabited by spirits and deities. Trees were worshipped as symbols of strength, wisdom, and eternity. The cultural significance of forests is evident in myths, folklore, and religious practices that have been passed down through generations.  Forests have also been integral to the development of economies worldwide. The timber industry has been a cornerstone of economic growth for many nations, providing employment opportunities, raw materials for construction, and revenue from exports. However, the unchecked exploitation of forests has led to widespread deforestation, threatening the delicate balance of nature and exacerbating climate change.  The industrial revolution marked a turning point in human history, ushering in an era of unprecedented technological advancement but also escalating environmental degradation. The rapid industrialization of the 18th and 19th centuries led to extensive deforestation to fuel industries such as shipbuilding, construction, and paper production. The legacy of this period is visible in the loss of old-growth forests and the decline of biodiversity.  The 20th century brought about a shift in attitudes towards forests, with a growing recognition of their ecological importance. Conservation movements gained momentum as scientists and environmentalists raised awareness about the impact of deforestation on climate change and biodiversity loss. The establishment of national parks, wildlife reserves, and forest conservation areas became a global priority to safeguard these precious ecosystems for future generations.  In recent decades, there has been a concerted effort to promote sustainable forest management practices through initiatives such as reforestation, afforestation, and agroforestry. The Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations aim to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of forests for the benefit of present and future generations. Forest certification programs like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) have been established to promote responsible forestry practices and consumer awareness.  Forests continue to face threats from human activities such as deforestation, illegal logging, urbanization, and climate change. The loss of forests not only impacts biodiversity but also exacerbates global warming by reducing the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. Preserving and restoring forests is essential to mitigate the effects of climate change, protect wildlife habitats, and ensure the well-being of indigenous communities that depend on forests for their livelihoods.  In conclusion, forests have a rich and complex history that spans millennia, shaping the course of human development and leaving an indelible mark on civilizations worldwide. Recognizing the historical significance of forests underscores the importance of preserving these invaluable ecosystems for the benefit of all life on Earth. As stewards of the planet, it is our responsibility to safeguard forests and ensure their sustainable management for generations to come.""","768"
"Forbes Lindsay C H  1860 ","""On the night of February 5/8th, the Maine was blown up and two hundred and sixty-six of her complement lost their lives. President McKinley appointed a board of naval officers to investigate the circumstances. The resultant report, which was submitted to Congress, declared that the ship had been destroyed by an external explosion. The condition of affairs aroused serious apprehensions on the part of the Spanish Government and at the same time exhilarated the insurgent leaders. Both parties realized that the intervention of the United States was imminent. The former proposed a suspension of hostilities, pending an agreement upon terms of peace, and offered to appropriate $00,00 for the benefit of the reconcentrados. These overtures were promptly rejected by the insurgent leaders. Early in April, the President sent a message to Congress requesting authority to end the war and to secure in Cuba the establishment of a stable government, capable of fulfilling its international obligations and maintaining peace. This was, in effect, a request to enter upon war with Spain. A few days later, Congress passed joint resolutions demanding the withdrawal of Spain from Cuba and empowering the President to use the naval and military forces of the United States to carry the resolutions into effect. This was virtually a declaration of war. IV CUBA IN A circumstantial account of the war of liberation would make anything but pleasant reading. Aside from the fact that on one side was a down-trodden people struggling to throw off the yoke of the oppressor, there was little in the conflict to excite admiration, or even interest. Barbarities of the worst kind were practised by the insurgents as well as by the Spaniards, and it would be profitless to enquire where the balance of blame lay when both were so deeply guilty. From the technical point of view the protracted hostilities hardly deserved to be termed war. Until the participation of the United States there was not an engagement which might be justly described as a battle. Neither side displayed any extraordinary military capacity, but the plans and movements of the rebels were characterized by greater intelligence and purpose than those of their opponents. During the entire war one manuvre alone was of a high order of strategy. That was the brilliant operation in which Antonio Maceo, the mulatto, swept from end to end of the Island, and lighted the flame of rebellion throughout its length. One of the most important features of the war was the prominent part taken in it by the black and colored elements of the population. They formed the backbone of the insurgent army, and furnished several of its most able leaders. As a result the race of color has secured a standing and influence in Cuba which it does not enjoy in any other country where the Caucasian is dominant. On one of the closing days of 895/8, the constitutional guarantees were suspended in Cuba by proclamation. The Government had suddenly awakened to the fact that a mine had been quietly laid beneath its feet. For months a wide-spread conspiracy, having its fountainhead in the United States, had been in existence. The Cuban Junta in New York had, during this time, energetically collected money and arms for the purpose of promoting a rebellion with greater determination and upon better organized lines than ever before. With some of the leaders the object entertained was autonomy; with others, complete independence; and with a third element, annexation to the United States. All were united, however, in a burning desire to terminate the rule of Spain over their native land. For some time previous to the proclamation of the Governor-General, arms and ammunition had been shipped to Cuba from various American ports and were secreted in different parts of the Island. Several local outbreaks had presaged the approaching storm, which burst in March. Before the close of April, the brothers Maceo, Jose Marti, and Maximo Gomez had returned to Cuba and resumed their respective places at the head of the rebel ranks. Close upon their heels arrived Martinez Campos, who had effected the peace at Zanjon, to take the part of Governor-General. Without delay, the insurgent generals set about carrying out the shrewd design of spreading the rebellion over every part of the Island. Their object was not only to increase the difficulties of the Spaniards, but also to give the uprising as formidable an aspect as possible, in the hope of securing the recognition, if not the intervention, of the United States. General Campos entered upon his task with the hope of bringing about a cessation of the insurrection by means of conciliatory measures. One of his first acts was to issue a manifesto to the rebels, offering pardon to all such as should lay down their arms and resume their allegiance to the Crown of Spain. In his proclamation of martial law he enjoined upon his troops the observance of the recognized principles of humane warfare. Within a week of his arrival, General Campos took command of the troops in the field. A period of desultory fighting ensued and, at length, in the middle of July, the first serious action of the war took place. The Spaniards in force met a body of insurgents near Bayamo. Probably there were about three thousand on either side. The insurgents had the better of the engagement, which was hotly contested, and General Campos narrowly escaped the loss of his life. Followed months of skirmishing, in which the rebels attacked isolated garrisons with considerable success, but avoided encounters with large bodies of troops. Meanwhile, numerous filibustering expeditions disembarked with recruits and munitions of war, greatly strengthening the revolutionary movement. By the end of the summer, eighty thousand Spanish regulars, besides a number of volunteers and guerrillas, were in the field. The insurgent forces did not exceed twenty thousand men, a considerable proportion of whom were armed only with machetes. But the Spaniards shortly learned to dread this weapon more than the rifle. Before the close of the year dynamite and the torch were brought into play. The revolutionists began, at first with discrimination, to burn plantations and to blow up bridges. On the other side the Spaniards commenced to execute insurgent chiefs who were captured. In December the march to the west was vigorously pushed by Gomez and Maceo, whilst Campos employed all his resources in the effort to intercept it. The result was a series of technical movements in which the Spanish troops, although led by generals of experience, were usually worsted. Detached bodies of insurgents harassed the royalist commands, and diverted their attention, while Maceo steadily pushed westward, gathering recruits in his progress and leaving a train of active rebellion in his wake. The trochas, or trenches, strung with fortlets, to which the Spaniards resorted as a means of stemming the tide, proved of little efficacy. The insurgents, in large bodies, crossed them time and again. With one hundred thousand troops at his command, Campos found it impossible to check or circumscribe the rebel movements. As time went on the insurgents became more and more unrestrained in the destruction of property. Cane-fields, sugar mills, residences, were given to the flames wherever they could be reached. This was done in pursuance of a definite policy which Gomez had repeatedly announced in his proclamations. He declared that the readiest means of inducing the Spaniards to leave the Island was to make it worthless to them. If this theory was somewhat farfetched, there could be no question of the practical effect of the destruction of the sugar crop in curtailing the resources of the administration. Early in 896, the insurgents had penetrated within a few miles of Habana and the proclamation of martial law was extended to embrace the whole Island. The Governor-General returned to the capital, which was in a state of turmoil and panic. Gomez, however, did not for an instant entertain the idea of so rash an enterprise as an attack upon the City. His purpose was to make a spectacular demonstration for the sake of its moral effect and to concentrate the attention of the Spanish commanders upon himself in order that Maceo might push on to Pinar del Rio with less opposition. In both respects he was eminently successful. Maceo traversed the entire length of Pinar del Rio, and that Province, in which rebellion had never before reared its head, was soon in open revolt from end to end. During January and February, Maceo ranged through Pinar del Rio and the southern portion of Habana, constantly engaged with one or another of the many detachments that were sent against him. For a brief space he transferred his operations to Matanzas, but returned to Pinar del Rio and for eight months withstood the numerous strong bodies of troops which General Weyler threw against him. Toward the close of the year 896, Maceo began a march eastward and was killed in a chance encounter with a small force of Spanish soldiers. In the execution of the plan for the invasion of the western portion of Cuba, which was conceived by Gomez, Antonio Maceo performed a splendid service for the insurgent cause. Although inferior in intellect to his chief and some other rebel leaders, Maceo was the most capable captain of them all, and his prestige among friends and foes was greater than that of any of his associates. When General Campos returned to Habana, at the close of the year 895/8, it was to find popular discontent and political conspiracy directed against him.""","""Cuban War of Independence""","1915","""The Cuban War of Independence was a pivotal event in Cuban history, marking a significant moment in the country's struggle for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. Spanning from 1895 to 1898, the war was fueled by a desire for independence and autonomy among the Cuban people. The roots of the conflict can be traced back to Spain's oppressive colonial policies, economic exploitation, and the lack of political representation for Cubans in their own affairs.  The growing discontent among the Cuban population eventually led to the emergence of revolutionary leaders such as José Martí, who played a crucial role in organizing and mobilizing the independence movement. Martí's writings and speeches inspired many to rise up against Spanish rule, advocating for unity, liberty, and the establishment of a sovereign Cuban nation.  The Cuban War of Independence officially began on February 24, 1895, when Cuban rebels launched a series of uprisings across the island. The rebels, known as mambises, employed guerrilla warfare tactics to combat the better-equipped Spanish forces. The conflict quickly escalated into a brutal and bloody struggle, as both sides engaged in fierce battles and acts of violence.  One of the most notable figures in the war was General Máximo Gómez, a Dominican military leader who joined the Cuban cause and became a key strategist for the rebel forces. Under his leadership, the insurgents achieved significant victories against the Spanish army, gaining control of large swathes of territory in Cuba.  The war garnered international attention, with the United States closely monitoring the developments in Cuba. Growing public sympathy for the Cuban cause, coupled with anti-Spanish sentiment, eventually pushed the U.S. to intervene in the conflict. The mysterious sinking of the USS Maine in Havana harbor in 1898 further escalated tensions between the U.S. and Spain, ultimately leading to the Spanish-American War.  As a result of the Spanish-American War, Spain was defeated, and the Treaty of Paris was signed in December 1898, officially ending the Cuban War of Independence. The treaty granted Cuba its independence from Spain, marking the culmination of years of struggle and sacrifice by the Cuban people.  Although the war resulted in Cuban independence, it also had lasting repercussions for the country. The U.S. military occupation of Cuba following the end of the conflict, as well as the imposition of the Platt Amendment, greatly influenced the course of Cuban history in the years to come. Despite gaining independence, Cuba continued to grapple with external influences and challenges that shaped its political, social, and economic landscape.  In conclusion, the Cuban War of Independence stands as a testament to the courage and resilience of the Cuban people in their fight for freedom and self-determination. The war not only reshaped Cuban society but also had far-reaching implications for the region as a whole. It remains a defining chapter in Cuban history, highlighting the enduring spirit of independence and the quest for sovereignty among its people.""","582"
"Newman Charles Robert","""Instead of accusing his principles I shall have to impute to him the not sufficiently carrying them out; a fault due to his position as an early reformer, and perfectly consistent with his high character as such. I have the more reason to note this distinction between M. Cousin's department and the function exercised by Locke, because I am forced myself to take the benefit of it. Want of erudition would form very vulnerable points, were I to be judged by the former standard. In the little I have yet put forth on the subject of First Principles, I already find two or three errors of that sort, which a greater amount of reading would no doubt have enabled me to escape. My present letter may close with some correction of one of these. Preliminary, I will venture to call 'That which is is,' a first principle of reason, and 'Two and two make four,' one of its derivatives, leaving this topic for future explanation, and then proceed thus:--When in my last letter I represented first principles as bounding the horizon of human knowledge, I left it to be inferred that both the kinds of 'first principles' I had mentioned were thus describable in common. I find, however, that this metaphysical character belongs exclusively to first principles of sensuous experience, and no more belongs to first principles of reason than to first principles of grammar, or to first principles of rhetoric. That is, first principles of reason are merely the result of one of those analytical inquiries in which we arrive at something absolutely simple, and must there stop, just as in the science of numbers we may thus arrive at unity. Having long ago defined First Principles of sensuous experience, I find there is a difficulty attached to the other kind of first principles derived from the various use of the word reason--which I will say betrayed me into a wrong inference in the concluding paragraph of my last letter. Locke, in the 7th chapter of his fourth book, confesses that this word, in the proper use of the English language, is liable to bear several senses. Due discrimination in such a case, and a cautious avoidance of the dangers to which philosophy is exposed, and has so amply incurred, from this kind of source might, above all, have been, expected from Locke, since he was the first who inculcated it, and is generally remarkable for the observance of his own precepts in this matter. Hence the charge I have now got to bring against him is a little surprising. Indeed, it might be asserted that his position and circumstances do not seem very readily to bear the entire responsibility of some of his proceedings. Perhaps he might be characterised as a writer of somewhat humorous idiosyncracy in respect to tendency to fixed ideas. His lapses, indeed, are not many, but they are highly significant, as I shall have occasion in more than one instance to show, and among these must evidently be reckoned that I am now going to notice, since it imports the wrong definition of a word of such cardinal meaning. In defining the word reason, in its proper and specific sense wherein it is used to denote a certain well-known quality of the human mind--that is, as approvedly ascertained and appreciated under this name, as are certain weights and measures under those of pound, gallon, or mile, he assigns a meaning to it that comes short of the proportions thus justly prefigured as belonging to it. He confounds reason with reasoning--that is, he emerges the entire faculty or modus operandi, to which we give the name of reason, in that partial exercise of its function to which we give the name of reasoning. He says that, in matters of certainty, such as the proof of any of Euclid's theorems, the acts by which the mind ascertains the fit coherence of the several links in the chain of reasoning are acts of reason. Granted. Also, that in weighing probabilities, a similar coherence is similarly verified by reason. Granted--with liberty of comment that these arts of reason, in either of the two cases have, by the approved practice of language, received the name of reasoning. But he further signifies--that is, he does not expressly affirm, but, with equivalent certification, he implicitly asserts, and inferentially states that, in examining such a proposition as the following:--'What is, is' (an examination to which confessedly no reasoning is attached), the act by which the mind assents to the truth of this statement is not to be described as an act of reason. He adopts a different phraseology, and calls it intuition. Observe, my objection is not that he invests the idea with this new name, but that he disparages its old one. I do not object to your calling a spade a shovel, under a certain view of its use, but it remains still necessary that you should admit that a spade is, in the full sense of the word, a spade. Indeed, I will incidentally remark that I suspect the word 'intuition' has been a very good addition to our vocabulary, and I suppose its proper import might be represented as follows:--Reason has two modes of his exercise, the one is called reasoning, and the other intuition. Intuition is the decision of reason on one single point; reasoning--a word proper to demonstrative truth--seems to be nothing more than intuition looking not merely at one point, but at several points successively. So that intuition and reasoning would constitute the self-same function of reason, and the difference in their meanings would be solely owing to the difference in the circumstances under which that function is exercised. Observe, that I am here only venturing to speculate, and am now returning from that digression. Whether or not Locke is herein psychologically consistent with himself; whether, indeed, his real theory is not that which I have just conjecturally intimated, is another question, which I shall defer to a future occasion; but whether or not he herein opposes the ordinary, prevailing, and inveterate use of language, which is what I am charging him with doing, and whether or not he has justifiable ground for this innovation which I am denying that he has, are points that must be tried by the ordeal of these three considerations. How are we accustomed to speak? How are we accustomed to write? and what sort of a call for changing our customs in either of these particulars is that which constitutes a genuine call to do so? In regard to the first of these tests, the literature of all sects and parties has been accustomed to assert that, both in matters of science and of worldly business, reason is the judge of all truth whatever, without exception. Locke, on the other hand, informs us that reason is the judge of demonstrative truth, of logical truth, of casuistical truth, and of lawyers' truth, and of these kinds of truth alone, but is not the judge of intuitive or self-evident truth. Our writers would tell us that to deny 'what is, is' to be a true statement, would be an offence against reason; but we learn from Locke that reason has no cognisance in this matter, but intuition only has, and consequently that the wrong committed would not be against reason, but against intuition. Our current speech accords with our literature in this view of the meaning of the word reason; whose efficiency, moreover, it endeavors to amplify, by surrounding it with satellites of adjectives formed from it, the principal of which are 'reasonable' and 'unreasonable.' Provided with this vocabulary, we pronounce it to be unreasonable to deny any truth whatever that can be well and clearly ascertained; and so far are we from reserving these adjectives for the occasion of demonstrative truth, and holding them inapplicable where self-evident or intuitive truth comes on the carpet, that we account it, if possible, still more unreasonable to deny the latter than the former. But if the nomenclature adopted by Locke be the right one, there ought to be a change in these current modes of speaking and writing. One who should reject the proofs of Euclid, would be unreasonable; one who should maintain that Thurtel or Greenacre were innocent of murder, would be unreasonable; but, one who should deny the truth of any self-evident proposition, would not be unreasonable; for to say this, would be to say that reason has cognisance of such propositions, whereas, according to him, it is expressly not reason, but intuition that takes this office. The words 'intuitional' and 'unintuitional,' must be invented to supply the obvious need which the apparent gap discovers; there seems no other way of supplying it. Lest I should be suspected of somewhat making up a case; of having, perhaps, represented not so much what Locke really means, as what he seems to mean, I will remind the reader that Locke is undertaking the formal definition of a word, and that on such a critical occasion, it is proper to give him credit for not meaning otherwise than he seems to mean. The passage which is my text, will be found in the earlier part of the seventeenth chapter of the fourth book. Indeed, I could at once prove my indictment by citing a few words from it, accompanied by a comment of my own, had I any right to impose on the reader a belief in the discriminating fairness and matter-of-fact accuracy, both of my extracts and my comment. I will, however, venture on such a step; I will suppose myself commenting on this passage, and proceed thus: Locke, it will be seen in this, his foremost and professed definition of the word reason, contrasts it with 'sense and intuition.' Whether he holds these to be identical with what he calls 'the outward and the inward sense,' is not quite clear. That, however, is not the question. He says, that these two faculties 'reach but a very little way'; for that 'the greatest part of our knowledge depends upon deductions and intermediate ideas.'""","""Philosophical Inquiry on Reason and Intuition""","2058","""Philosophical Inquiry on Reason and Intuition  In the realm of philosophical inquiry, the juxtaposition of reason and intuition has long been a central theme of debate and contemplation. Both reason and intuition are essential cognitive faculties that humans use to navigate the world, make decisions, and seek understanding. They are often seen as contrasting approaches to acquiring knowledge and truth, yet their interplay and relationship are crucial to our intellectual and existential pursuits. This exploration delves into the nature of reason and intuition, their roles in philosophical thought, and the ways in which they interact and complement each other.  Reason, often associated with logic, analysis, and deduction, is a rational faculty that relies on evidence, facts, and logical principles to reach conclusions. It involves the use of critical thinking, rational argumentation, and systematic processes to make sense of the world and solve problems. Reason is deeply ingrained in the Western philosophical tradition, with figures like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant emphasizing the importance of rationality and logical coherence in the pursuit of truth and wisdom.  On the other hand, intuition is a more elusive and mysterious cognitive phenomenon that involves immediate apprehension, insight, and understanding without the need for conscious reasoning or inference. Intuition is often described as a gut feeling, a hunch, or a sense of knowing that transcends rational explanation. It is linked to creativity, imagination, and holistic perception, allowing individuals to grasp complex ideas, patterns, and truths that may elude conscious analysis. Philosophers like Schopenhauer, Bergson, and Nietzsche championed intuition as a source of profound wisdom and metaphysical insight.  The relationship between reason and intuition is a source of perennial philosophical inquiry. One perspective posits that reason and intuition are distinct and even conflicting modes of cognition, with reason prioritizing logic and empirical evidence while intuition taps into deeper truths and metaphysical realities. This view suggests that reason and intuition represent different cognitive capacities that serve complementary but separate purposes in the quest for knowledge and understanding.  Conversely, some philosophers argue for a more integrated approach, where reason and intuition work in tandem to produce a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of reality. This viewpoint sees reason and intuition not as opposites, but as mutually enriching faculties that can inform and support each other in the pursuit of truth. By embracing both rational analysis and intuitive insight, individuals can access a broader spectrum of knowledge and insight that transcends the limitations of either approach alone.  The debate over reason and intuition extends to various branches of philosophy, including epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. In epistemology, the study of knowledge, the question of how we acquire knowledge and justify beliefs lies at the heart of the reason-intuition dichotomy. Rationalists emphasize the role of reason and sensory experience in knowledge acquisition, while empiricists highlight the importance of intuition, innate ideas, and a priori knowledge.  Metaphysical inquiries delve into the nature of reality and existence, with reason offering systematic frameworks and logical structures to analyze the nature of being, causality, time, and space. Intuition, on the other hand, opens the door to metaphysical speculation, mystical experiences, and insights into the interconnectedness of all things. The tension between reason's analytical rigor and intuition's holistic vision shapes philosophical discourse on the nature of reality and our place within it.  Ethical debates often revolve around the interplay of reason and intuition in moral decision-making. While reason provides moral frameworks, ethical principles, and consequentialist calculations to guide ethical judgments, intuition offers immediate moral insights, emotional responses, and moral intuitions that shape our ethical sensibilities. The ethical landscape is enriched when reason and intuition collaborate to inform ethical deliberation and moral action.  In aesthetics, the philosophy of art and beauty, reason and intuition converge to illuminate the nature of aesthetic experience and artistic creation. Reason analyzes artworks in terms of form, symmetry, composition, and meaning, while intuition enables an immediate, emotional response to art that transcends intellectual interpretation. The intermingling of reason and intuition in aesthetics showcases the multifaceted nature of human perception and appreciation of beauty.  The philosophical inquiry into reason and intuition also extends to practical domains such as decision-making, problem-solving, and personal growth. In everyday life, individuals often face choices that require a balance between rational deliberation and intuitive judgment. While reason can offer systematic analysis and evidence-based reasoning to make informed decisions, intuition can provide valuable insights, emotional cues, and subjective perceptions that guide choices and actions.  Moreover, the relationship between reason and intuition plays a crucial role in personal development and self-discovery. By cultivating both rational faculties and intuitive capacities, individuals can deepen their understanding of themselves, others, and the world around them. Integrating reason and intuition in self-reflection, introspection, and contemplation can lead to profound insights, transformative experiences, and a more holistic approach to personal growth and well-being.  The dynamic interplay between reason and intuition invites us to embrace complexity, uncertainty, and paradox in our philosophical inquiries and intellectual endeavors. Rather than viewing reason and intuition as opposing forces, we can appreciate them as complementary dimensions of human cognition that enrich our perception of reality, broaden our understanding of truth, and deepen our engagement with the mysteries of existence.  In conclusion, philosophical inquiry on reason and intuition offers a rich tapestry of reflections on the nature of human cognition, knowledge acquisition, truth-seeking, and existential contemplation. By exploring the roles of reason and intuition in philosophy, we are invited to engage with the complexity of cognitive processes, the interplay of rationality and intuition, and the ways in which these faculties shape our understanding of ourselves and the world. Ultimately, the dialogue between reason and intuition invites us to transcend dualistic thinking, embrace the unity of rational and intuitive modes of knowing, and embark on a multifaceted journey of philosophical exploration and intellectual discovery.""","1183"
"Shillito Elizabeth Helen","""O grant me calmness. June.--Saw Mrs. Barret. Copied. Neglected prayer greatly. Very worldly. June.--Wrote letters. A terrible blank of worldliness. Idle. June.--Wrote to Miss Elwell. Letter from Cheltenham. Copied certificates. Worldly. Spoke angrily to A. At this time there are many allusions in her journal to crossness. Probably it was the result of that supreme test of the active, energetic mind--the enduring of uncertainty. In 901 she wrote to a friend about this period of her life:-- Once I had an interval of work, and I thought perhaps God would not give it me again--but after that interval He called me here. I think now I can see better how I needed that time of comparative quiet and solitude, and a time to think over my failures, and a time to be more helpful to my family. Whilst still young, Dorothea Beale formed the habit of frequent attendance at early Communion, which she maintained all through her busy life. Like the saintly men and women of all ages, she felt that the more strenuous and exacting her work, the more she needed these hours of Communion. The Sacraments of the Church as generally necessary to salvation she believed to be two--Baptism and Holy Communion--but the whole of life to her was sacramental. More and more as years passed by did outward and visible things become to her the signs of inward and spiritual realities: to her, and to those of her school of thought, sacramentalism meant the discovery of the river of the water of life flowing through the whole desert of human existence. But Dorothea Beale was no dreamy, unpractical mystic, holding herself aloof from the practical difficulties of life. She realised that there is little value in a religion that cannot find expression in the life of every day; and little strength in the soul that is not continually fortified by the struggle of work and the carrying out of duty. The religion of Dorothea Beale, says Mrs. Raikes, was far indeed from being a mere succession of beautiful and comforting thoughts. It meant authority. It involved all the difficulties of daily obedience, it meant the fatigue of watching, the pains of battle, sometimes the humiliation of defeat. Intense as was her feeling on religious subjects, it was never permitted to go off in steam, as she would term it, but became at once a practical matter for everyday life. V.. O, I am sure they really came from Thee, The urge, the ardour, the unconquerable will, The potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words, A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep. These speed me on. --WALT, Prayer of Columbus. Until about 825/8, Cheltenham was simply a small market-town, famous for its mild climate and fertile soil, but at this time its medicinal springs were discovered, and it became the fashion for royalty and aristocracy to take the waters. Between 801 and 840 the population of Cheltenham increased tenfold. In 843, Cheltenham College, a proprietary school for boys, was opened. Ten years later, on September 0, 85/83, a meeting was held in the house of the Rev. H. Walford Bellairs, who was Her Majestys Inspector of Schools in Gloucestershire, and a prospectus was drawn up of A College in Cheltenham for the education of young ladies and children under eight. The instruction was to include the Liturgy of the Church of England, grammar, geography, arithmetic, French, drawing, needlework. The fees were to range from guineas to 0 guineas a year, and the capital was to consist of 000 in 0 shares. The entire management and control were to be in the hands of the founders, the Rev. H. W. Bellairs; the Rev. W. Dobson, Principal of Cheltenham College; the Rev. H. A. Holden, Vice-Principal; Lieutenant-Colonel Fitzmaurice; Dr. S. E. Comyn; and Mr. Nathaniel Hartland. They appointed as Principal Mrs. Procter, the widow of Colonel Procter, and as Vice-Principal her daughter, Miss Procter, who was understood to be the actual head. Mrs. Procter was to furnish the wisdom and stability of mature years, Miss Procter the youth and vigour necessary for teaching. A younger sister held the post of secretary. At first it was intended that the college should be restricted to day pupils, but it was soon found that this would limit its usefulness, and some months before the opening of the school the proprietors had arranged for three boarding-houses, the fees of which were extremely low, being only 0 a year. Cheltenham Ladies College was laid on good foundations. The founders had an ardent desire for a thorough and liberal education, and their ideas were well carried out from the very beginning of the schools career. The teaching appears to have been of a high order, the teachers were people of conscience and ability. In her History of Cheltenham Ladies College, Miss Beale quotes from old pupils who spoke most highly of the early days. The school was opened on February 3, 85/84, in Cambray House, where the great Duke of Wellington had once stayed for about six weeks. It was a fine square-built house with a beautiful garden. By the end of the first year the 00 pupils had increased to 5/80; the second year also marked an increase. But after that the numbers began to go down, until at the end of 85/87 the numbers had fallen to 9, and the capital had begun to diminish. Some disagreement on educational methods then arose between Miss Procter and the Committee, with the result that the former resigned and started another school in Cheltenham, which was continued for thirty years. The Principals letter to the Committee on her departure shows her scrupulous care of the property of others:-- MY DEAR SIR, I thank you much for your kind letter enclosing your cheque for 1 0s. d. I take this opportunity of sending you the keys of the college. The house has been cleaned throughout. The chimneys have all been swept. Some few stores--nearly 1 4 cwt. of soap, some dip candles, and two new scrubbing brushes--are in the closet in the pantry. The new zinc ventilator is in the press used for the drawing materials. Two cast-iron fenders, of mine, have been removed from two of the class-rooms. I remain, my dear Sir, Yours very sincerely, S. ANNE. It was in May, 85/88, that the advertisement for a new Principal of Cheltenham College appeared in various papers.. A vacancy having occurred in the office of lady Principal, candidates for the appointment are requested to apply by June to J. P. Bell, Esq., Hon. Sec., Cheltenham. A well educated and experienced desired, capable of conducting an institution with not less than one hundred day pupils. A competent knowledge of German and French, and a good acquaintance with general English literature, arithmetic, and the common branches of female education, are expected. Salary, upwards of 00 a year, with furnished apartments and other advantages. No testimonials to be sent until applied for, and no answers will be returned except to candidates apparently eligible. Dorothea Beale applied for this post and was accepted as a candidate for the headship. She had now to set about getting testimonials and recommendations. Some of these are interesting. Miss Elwell, at whose school she had taught, wrote:-- You have succeeded in making subjects usually styled dry, positively attractive, whilst your plan has been successful in forming not merely superficial scholars, even whilst producing results in a remarkably short period. Her friend, Elizabeth Ann Alston, wrote:-- Of her power of teaching others and making them delight in their studies, there is no doubt. But you do not know her, as I do, in her home and daily life: there all look up to her and seek her counsel. Many testimonials were given as to her character and work, and these made such a favourable impression on the Cheltenham Committee that she was summoned for an interview on June 4. She evidently had not any suitable clothes to wear on such a formidable occasion, and had to borrow a blue silk frock from her sister Eliza. Perhaps the work on her history had prevented her from attending to her wardrobe. She was appointed and everything seemed happily settled. One can imagine with what joy she looked forward to this opportunity of doing the work she longed to do untrammelled by bonds made by those of differing ideas. After all these months of waiting she had at last obtained her hearts desire. But the stigma of leaving Casterton was not easily removed, and a great blow awaited her. On July 2 she received a letter from Mr. J. Penrice Bell, the Honorary Secretary of the Committee, saying that he had received from two gentlemen letters about her religious views, that might make it necessary for the Cheltenham Ladies College Committee to reconsider their decision. He quoted briefly their allegations:-- She, Miss Beale, is very High Church, to say the least, and holds ultra views of baptismal regeneration.. She has also a serious and deep religious feeling, and a self-denying character. But she is decidedly High Church. Her opinions on the vital and critical question of sacramental grace are altogether those of the High Church or Tractarian school. To a sensitive girl like Dorothea Beale this was indeed a shock, but she was determined not to lose the desired work through any misunderstanding, and replied at once to Mr. Bell explaining her views on baptism, which were said to be extreme:-- If you understand by the opus operatum efficacy of baptism that all who are baptized are therefore saved. I explicitly state that I do not hold that doctrine. I believe baptism to be an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given unto us: to be the appointed means for admitting members into the Church of Christ.""","""Dorothea Beale's religious journey""","2141","""Dorothea Beale, a prominent figure in the field of education during the 19th century, embarked on a profound religious journey that greatly influenced her life and work. Born in 1831, Beale grew up in a religiously devout household where her parents instilled in her a strong sense of faith and morality. Throughout her life, Beale's beliefs and spirituality played a significant role in shaping her character, guiding her actions, and informing her educational philosophy. This exploration delves into Beale's religious journey, tracing the evolution of her faith, the impact it had on her work as an educator, and the legacy she left behind.  Raised in a Christian family, Beale's early years were deeply influenced by her parents' commitment to their faith. Her mother, Maria, imparted valuable lessons on charity and compassion, instilling in Beale a sense of duty towards helping others. This upbringing laid the foundation for Beale's later philanthropic endeavors and her dedication to improving the lives of women through education. As Beale matured, her own spiritual convictions deepened, leading her to seek a deeper understanding of her beliefs and their implications for her life's work.  Beale's educational journey mirrored her spiritual growth, as she recognized the transformative power of education in shaping individuals and society. Drawing inspiration from her Christian faith, Beale believed in the inherent value and dignity of every person, a belief that guided her approach to teaching and learning. She viewed education not merely as a means to acquire knowledge but as a path to moral and spiritual development. Beale's faith infused her educational principles with a sense of purpose, emphasizing the importance of character formation, integrity, and service to others.  As Beale's reputation as an educator grew, so did her platform to promote her religious ideals. She saw education as a means of moral upliftment, a way to cultivate virtuous citizens who would contribute positively to society. Beale's religious convictions permeated every aspect of her work, from curriculum design to discipline policies, shaping the ethos of the schools she led. Her commitment to providing girls with a holistic education that nurtured their intellectual, spiritual, and moral dimensions set her apart as a visionary in the field of education.  Throughout her career, Beale faced numerous challenges and obstacles, yet her faith provided her with the strength and resilience to persevere. In moments of adversity, Beale turned to her religious beliefs for solace and guidance, finding comfort in prayer and reflection. Her unwavering trust in divine providence sustained her through difficult times and fueled her determination to continue her mission of empowering women through education.  Beale's religious journey was not without its complexities and contradictions. Despite her progressive views on women's education and empowerment, she held traditional beliefs about gender roles and the sanctity of marriage. While she advocated for women's intellectual and spiritual growth, she also upheld certain social conventions that reflected the Victorian values of her time. This tension between modernity and tradition, progressivism and conservatism, shaped Beale's approach to education and her interactions with her students.  In her later years, Beale's religious convictions evolved as she grappled with the changing social landscape and the shifting role of women in society. She increasingly focused on promoting women's rights and advocating for gender equality, aligning her beliefs with the emerging feminist movements of the time. Beale's faith continued to inform her advocacy work, as she saw the struggle for women's rights as a moral imperative rooted in principles of justice and equality.  As Beale's career drew to a close, her legacy as an educator and a woman of faith became firmly entrenched in the annals of history. Her commitment to combining academic rigor with spiritual values set a standard for educational institutions around the world. The impact of her religious journey reverberated through generations of students who benefited from her visionary approach to education. Beale's legacy serves as a testament to the enduring power of faith to inspire positive change and transform lives.  In conclusion, Dorothea Beale's religious journey was a transformative odyssey that shaped her identity as an educator, a leader, and a woman of faith. Her unwavering commitment to integrating her religious beliefs with her educational mission set her apart as a trailblazer in the field of women's education. Through her work, Beale not only empowered countless women to pursue knowledge and wisdom but also inspired them to live with purpose and integrity. Her legacy continues to inspire educators and learners alike to embrace the transformative potential of faith in their quest for personal and societal enlightenment.""","917"
"Tanner Thomas Hawkes","""Magnesia or its carbonate should be given freely in mucilaginous fluids. Oils had better be avoided, except for the purpose of removing all traces of the poison by the stomach-pump. Prompt treatment is all in all. Detection.--There is but one really satisfactory plan for detecting phosphorus in organic mixtures, that invented by Mitscherlich. The suspected material is introduced into a retort, and acidulated with sulphuric acid. The stem of the retort is conducted into a glass vessel kept cool by a stream of water on the outside. The retort is heated, and distillation allowed to go on in the dark. If phosphorus be present it passes over as vapor, and is condensed in the cool vessel beyond. At each condensation a flash of light is perceived, which is the test relied on. by phosphorus used to be exceedingly common among match manufacturers, but is now, comparatively speaking, rare, allotropic or amorphous phosphorus being much more generally employed than it used to be, and the ventilation of the workshops being better. Its subjects used to be attacked with caries of the gums, gradually extending and implicating the jaw, and giving rise to great deformity. XV.. is by far the most important of metallic poisons, whether we consider the deadliness of its effects or the fatal frequency with which they are made manifest. Arsenic exists as an impurity in several metallic ores, notably in iron pyrites, which being commonly employed as a material for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, renders arsenic one of the most frequent impurities of commercial oil of vitriol. This should never be forgotten in testing any substance for the poison. To the common medicinal preparation of arsenic, consisting of arsenious acid, or arsenites, and the so-called chloride of arsenic, must be added the arseniates of potash and soda; the sulphides of arsenic--as, the red sulphide, or realgar, and the yellow sulphide, or orpiment; the arsenite of copper, or Scheele's green, and others. They all produce similar symptoms, and poisoning by either of them requires nearly the same treatment. According to Von Tschudi, some of the peasants in parts of Styria and Hungary eat arsenic, taking from two to five grains daily; the men doing so in order that they may gain strength, and be able to endure fatigue, the women that they may improve their complexions. These statements are so contrary to all that we know of the power of this poison, that they have been regarded as unworthy of credit. Evidence has, however, been brought forward by Dr. Craig Maclagan, of Edinburgh, which shows clearly that arsenic-eating is something more than a mere fiction. This gentleman gave, and saw a Styrian eat, a piece of arsenious acid, weighing over four grains, and afterwards determined the presence of arsenic in urine passed in his presence by the said peasant. Advantage was taken of these reports in the trial of Miss Madeline Smith (Edinburgh, July, 85/87), when the court was asked to believe that arsenic found in the possession of the prisoner was used by her as a cosmetic. Arsenite of Copper, in one form or another, either as Scheele's green, emerald green, Brunswick green, &c., is unfortunately largely employed in the manufacture of green paper-hangings, artificial flowers, toys, and even some kinds of confectionery. Too many cases of ill-health caused by this practice have been recorded to permit any doubt as to its deleterious effects. These may be manifested by people living in rooms furnished with such paper-hangings. The chief symptoms are, sneezing, lachrymation, frontal headache, nausea, and loss of appetite, with colicky pains, thirst, &c. Among those employed in preparing the paper-hangings more serious symptoms manifest themselves. The irritation of the pigment gives rise to circular patches of ulceration on the alae of the nose, in the folds of the arm, in the groin and scrotum--in short, wherever dirt tends to lodge. These prove very untractable, except the employment be abandoned. In November, 861, a young woman died in London from the poisonous effects of arsenite of copper used in dusting wax leaves. The workmen who employ the pigment in its dry state suffer, while those who use it in a moist condition are probably unaffected by it. A simple method for roughly detecting arsenite of copper in these fabrics was published in the Chemical News (vol., p. 2). A small portion of the suspected material is to be put into a test tube with strong ammonia. If a blue tint be produced, a salt of copper is shown to be present. Withdraw the object, and drop a piece of nitrate of silver into the ammonia; if arsenic be there, the nitrate of silver will be covered with a yellow coating of arseniate of silver, which will disappear on stirring. On igniting arsenical paper and allowing it to smoulder, the odor of garlic may be detected in the fumes given off. Another mode in which the noxious effects of arsenic are produced is by the use of bright green tarlatans as ball dresses. One could hardly conceive a more deadly amusement than dancing in an arsenicated dress, sweeping against an arsenicated wall-paper. When both are lightly adherent the arsenic is scattered in showers about the room.""","""Phosphorus and Arsenic Poisoning""","1132","""Phosphorus and arsenic poisoning are serious medical conditions resulting from exposure to toxic substances that can have detrimental effects on human health. Understanding the sources, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of phosphorus and arsenic poisoning is crucial for prompt medical intervention and better outcomes.   Arsenic is a naturally occurring element found in the environment, often in soil and water sources. Phosphorus is a vital nutrient required for various bodily functions and is commonly found in fertilizers, detergents, and pesticides. However, both substances can be toxic when ingested in high concentrations.  Phosphorus poisoning usually occurs through the ingestion of rodenticides, especially zinc phosphide used in pest control. Symptoms of phosphorus poisoning include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, it can lead to organ failure and death. Immediate medical attention is crucial to prevent further complications.  Arsenic poisoning can result from consuming contaminated water, food, or air. Chronic exposure to arsenic has been linked to various health issues, including skin lesions, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. Symptoms of acute arsenic poisoning include vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Long-term exposure can lead to more severe health problems.  Diagnosing phosphorus and arsenic poisoning involves evaluating symptoms, conducting blood tests, and sometimes analyzing urine or stool samples to detect elevated levels of these substances. Imaging tests like X-rays or CT scans may be used to assess any internal damage caused by the poisoning.  Treatment for phosphorus poisoning focuses on reducing absorption and enhancing elimination of the toxin. This may involve administering activated charcoal, gastric lavage, or chelation therapy to bind and remove phosphorus from the body. Supportive care such as intravenous fluids and monitoring of organ function is essential in severe cases.  Managing arsenic poisoning includes stopping further exposure to the toxin and initiating treatments to remove arsenic from the body. Chelation therapy using medications like dimercaprol or succimer can help bind and eliminate arsenic. Supportive care to address symptoms such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or organ damage is also critical.  Prevention of phosphorus and arsenic poisoning involves proper storage and handling of toxic substances, ensuring water sources are free from contaminants, and being aware of potential sources of exposure in the environment. Educating individuals about the risks associated with these toxins can help prevent accidental poisonings.  In conclusion, phosphorus and arsenic poisoning are serious health concerns that require prompt recognition and treatment to prevent adverse outcomes. Understanding the sources, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options for these types of poisoning is essential for healthcare professionals and the general public alike. By raising awareness and taking preventive measures, the incidence of phosphorus and arsenic poisoning can be reduced, ultimately safeguarding the well-being of individuals and communities.""","562"
"Bryce James Bryce Viscount","""Nay more, its groundwork was true. It was the removal of the seat of government from the Tiber to the Bosphorus that made the Pope the greatest personage in the city, and in the prostration after Alaric's invasion he was seen to be so. Henceforth he alone was a permanent and effective, though still unacknowledged power, as truly superior to the revived senate and consuls of the phantom republic as Augustus and Tiberius had been to the faint continuance of their earlier prototypes. Pope Leo the First asserted the universal jurisdiction of his see, and his persevering successors slowly enthralled Italy, Illyricum, Gaul, Spain, Africa, dexterously confounding their undoubted metropolitan and patriarchal rights with those of oecumenical bishop, in which they were finally merged. By his writings and the fame of his personal sanctity, by the conversion of England and the introduction of an impressive ritual, Gregory the Great did more than any other pontiff to advance Rome's ecclesiastical authority. Yet his tone to Maurice of Constantinople was deferential, to Phocas adulatory; his successors were not consecrated till confirmed by the Emperor or the Exarch; one of them was dragged in chains to the Bosphorus, and banished thence to Scythia. When the iconoclastic controversy and the intervention of Pipin broke the allegiance of the Popes to the East, the Franks, as patricians and Emperors, seemed to step into the position which Byzantium had lost. At Charles's coronation, says the Saxon poet, 'Et summus eundem Prsul adoravit, sicut mos debitus olim Principibus fuit antiquis.' Their relations were, however, no longer the same. If the Frank vaunted conquest, the priest spoke only of free gift. What Christendom saw was that Charles was crowned by the Pope's hands, and undertook as his principal duty the protection and advancement of the Holy Roman Church. The circumstances of Otto the Great's coronation gave an even more favourable opening to sacerdotal claims, for it was a Pope who summoned him to Rome and a Pope who received from him an oath of fidelity and aid. In the conflict of three powers, the Emperor, the pontiff, and the people--represented by their senate and consuls, or by the demagogue of the hour--the most steady, prudent, and far-sighted was sure eventually to prevail. The Popedom had no minorities, as yet few disputed successions, few revolts within its own army--the host of churchmen through Europe. Boniface's conversion of Germany under its direct sanction, gave it a hold on the rising hierarchy of the greatest European state; the extension of the rule of Charles and Otto diffused in the same measure its emissaries and pretensions. The first disputes turned on the right of the prince to confirm the elected pontiff, which was afterwards supposed to have been granted by Hadrian I to Charles, in the decree quoted as 'Hadrianus Papa.' This 'ius eligendi et ordinandi summum pontificem,' which Lewis I appears as yielding by the 'Ego Ludovicus,' was claimed by the Carolingians whenever they felt themselves strong enough, and having fallen into desuetude in the troublous times of the Italian Emperors, was formally renewed to Otto the Great by his nominee Leo VIII. We have seen it used, and used in the purest spirit, by Otto himself, by his grandson Otto III, last of all, and most despotically, by Henry III. Along with it there had grown up a bold counter-assumption of the Papal chair to be itself the source of the imperial dignity. In submitting to a fresh coronation, Lewis the Pious admitted the invalidity of his former self-performed one: Charles the Bald did not scout the arrogant declaration of John VIII, that to him alone the Emperor owed his crown; and the council of Pavia, when it chose him king of Italy, repeated the assertion. Subsequent Popes knew better than to apply to the chiefs of Saxon and Franconian chivalry language which the feeble Neustrian had not resented; but the precedent remained, the weapon was only hid behind the pontifical robe to be flashed out with effect when the moment should come. There were also two other great steps which papal power had taken. By the invention and adoption of the False Decretals it had provided itself with a legal system suited to any emergency, and which gave it unlimited authority through the Christian world in causes spiritual and over persons ecclesiastical. Canonistical ingenuity found it easy in one way or another to make this include all causes and persons whatsoever: for crime is always and wrong is often sin, nor can aught be anywhere done which may not affect the clergy. On the gift of Pipin and Charles, repeated and confirmed by Lewis I, Charles II, Otto I and III, and now made to rest on the more venerable authority of the first Christian Emperor, it could found claims to the sovereignty of Rome, Tuscany, and all else that had belonged to the exarchate. Indefinite in their terms, these grants were never meant by the donors to convey full dominion over the districts--that belonged to the head of the Empire--but only as in the case of other church estates, a perpetual usufruct or dominium utile. They were, in fact, mere endowments. Nor had the gifts been ever actually reduced into possession: the Pope had been hitherto the victim, not the lord, of the neighbouring barons. They were not, however, denied, and might be made a formidable engine of attack: appealing to them, the Pope could brand his opponents as unjust and impious; and could summon nobles and cities to defend him as their liege lord, just as, with no better original right, he invoked the help of the Norman conquerors of Naples and Sicily. The attitude of the Roman Church to the imperial power at Henry the Third's death was externally respectful. The right of a German king to the crown of the city was undoubted, and the Pope was his lawful subject. Hitherto the initiative in reform had come from the civil magistrate. But the secret of the pontiff's strength lay in this: he, and he alone, could confer the crown, and had therefore the right of imposing conditions on its recipient. Frequent interregna had weakened the claim of the Transalpine monarch and prevented his power from taking firm root; his title was never by law hereditary: the holy Church had before sought and might again seek a defender elsewhere. And since the need of such defence had originated this transference of the Empire from the Greeks to the Franks, since to render it was the Emperor's chief function, it was surely the Pope's duty as well as his right to see that the candidate was capable of fulfilling his task, to degrade him if he rejected or misperformed it. The first step was to remove a blemish in the constitution of the Church, by fixing a regular body to choose the supreme pontiff. This Nicholas II did in A.D. 05/89, feebly reserving the rights of Henry IV and his successors. Then the reforming spirit, kindled by the abuses and depravity of the last century, advanced apace. It had two main objects: the enforcement of celibacy, especially on the secular clergy, who enjoyed in this respect considerable freedom, and the extinction of simony. In the former, the Emperors and a large part of the laity were not unwilling to join: the latter no one dared to defend in theory. But when Gregory VII declared that it was sin for the ecclesiastic to receive his benefice under conditions from a layman, and so condemned the whole system of feudal investitures to the clergy, he aimed a deadly blow at all secular authority. Half of the land and wealth of Germany was in the hands of bishops and abbots, who would now be freed from the monarch's control to pass under that of the Pope. In such a state of things government itself would be impossible. Henry and Gregory already mistrusted each other: after this decree war was inevitable. The Pope cited his opponent to appear and be judged at Rome for his vices and misgovernment. The Emperor replied by convoking a synod, which deposed and insulted Gregory. At once the dauntless monk pronounced Henry excommunicate, and fixed a day on which, if still unrepentant, he should cease to reign. Supported by his own princes, the monarch might have defied a mandate backed by no external force; but the Saxons, never contented since the first place had passed from their own dukes to the Franconians, only waited the signal to burst into a new revolt, whilst through all Germany the Emperor's tyranny and irregularities of life had sown the seeds of disaffection. Shunned, betrayed, threatened, he rushed into what seemed the only course left, and Canosa saw Europe's mightiest prince, titular lord of the world, a suppliant before the successor of the Apostle. Henry soon found that his humiliation had not served him; driven back into opposition, he defied Gregory anew, set up an anti-pope, overthrew the rival whom his rebellious subjects had raised, and maintained to the end of his sad and chequered life a power often depressed but never destroyed. Nevertheless had all other humiliation been spared, that one scene in the yard of the Countess Matilda's castle, an imperial penitent standing barefoot and woollen-frocked on the snow three days and nights, till the priest who sat within should admit and absolve him, was enough to mark a decisive change, and inflict an irretrievable disgrace on the crown so abased. Its wearer could no more, with the same lofty confidence, claim to be the highest power on earth, created by and answerable to God alone.""","""Papal authority and imperial power.""","2087","""Papal authority and imperial power have been two prominent and intertwined aspects of European history, shaping the political landscape of the continent for centuries. The relationship between the Papacy and various emperors, kings, and rulers has been a complex and often contentious one, marked by conflicts over jurisdiction, power struggles, and competing claims to authority. Understanding the dynamics between Papal authority and imperial power is essential to grasping the intricate balance of religious and secular power in medieval and early modern Europe.  The concept of Papal authority refers to the spiritual and ecclesiastical power wielded by the Pope, the bishop of Rome and leader of the Catholic Church. From the early days of Christianity, the Bishop of Rome held a position of respect and influence within the Christian community due to the city's historical significance as the former capital of the Roman Empire. Over time, the Pope's authority grew, becoming not only a religious but also a political force in Europe.  Papal authority was based on the belief in the Pope's role as the successor of St. Peter, the apostle chosen by Jesus to lead the Church. This belief was fundamental to the concept of papal primacy, which asserted the Pope's supremacy over all other bishops and his right to make decisions on matters of faith and doctrine. This spiritual authority was believed to be divinely sanctioned, giving the Pope a unique position of moral leadership and guidance within the Christian world.  Imperial power, on the other hand, refers to the secular authority held by emperors, kings, and rulers who governed vast territories and wielded political and military power. In the context of Europe, imperial power was often associated with the Holy Roman Empire, a political entity that emerged in the early Middle Ages and claimed to be the successor to the ancient Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Emperor was seen as the secular counterpart to the Pope, holding authority over territorial rulers and acting as a protector of Christendom.  The relationship between Papal authority and imperial power was characterized by a delicate balance of cooperation and conflict. On one hand, the Pope and the Emperor were expected to work together for the common good of Christendom, with the Pope providing spiritual guidance and the Emperor offering protection and stability. This idealized partnership, known as the """"two swords"""" theory, envisioned a harmonious relationship between the spiritual and secular powers in which each respected the other's sphere of influence.  However, in practice, the relationship between the Papacy and the imperial power was often marked by tension and rivalry. Conflicts arose over issues of authority, such as the investiture controversy, which centered on the question of whether secular rulers had the right to appoint bishops and abbots. This conflict reached its peak in the 11th and 12th centuries when both the Pope and the Emperor asserted their authority in appointing church officials, leading to a prolonged power struggle that had far-reaching consequences for both institutions.  The investiture controversy highlighted the broader struggle for supremacy between Papal authority and imperial power. The Pope claimed the right to crown and depose emperors, asserting the spiritual authority of the Church over secular rulers. Emperors, on the other hand, sought to maintain their independence and control over ecclesiastical matters, viewing the Church as a tool to legitimize their power and influence.  This power struggle played out in various ways throughout European history, with different Popes and Emperors clashing over issues of jurisdiction, taxation, and political influence. The conflict between the Papacy and imperial power was not limited to the Holy Roman Empire but extended to other European monarchies as well, including the kingdoms of France, England, and Spain.  Despite the conflicts and rivalries, the relationship between Papal authority and imperial power also had moments of cooperation and mutual benefit. Popes and Emperors often formed alliances to achieve common goals, such as launching crusades against external enemies or resolving disputes among ruling dynasties. These alliances were based on pragmatic considerations of power and politics, rather than ideological or religious unity.  The decline of the Holy Roman Empire in the late Middle Ages and the rise of nation-states in Europe marked a shift in the balance of power between Papal authority and imperial power. As centralized monarchies grew in strength and authority, the influence of the Pope and the Emperor diminished, giving rise to new political dynamics and power structures in Europe.  In conclusion, the relationship between Papal authority and imperial power has been a central theme in European history, reflecting the complex interplay between spiritual and secular authority. The interactions between the Pope and the Emperor were shaped by a variety of factors, including theology, politics, and personal rivalries, resulting in a dynamic and often turbulent relationship that left a lasting impact on the political and religious landscape of Europe. Understanding the history of Papal authority and imperial power is crucial to grasping the complexities of medieval and early modern European history and the enduring legacy of these two influential institutions.""","995"
"Gilman Elizabeth Hale","""Some people advocate the building of bins for vegetables. This is probably advisable if one must store many. For keeping only a few, neat boxes or baskets which may be moved about, are better. If one keeps food in the cellar, a cupboard or safe made of wire netting is a convenience. It should stand on legs which raise it two or three feet off the floor. If preserves and jellies are kept in the cellar, it is desirable to have a cupboard more completely enclosed than the safe, to protect them from dust, quick changes of temperature and dampness. Shelves, cupboards, bins and partitions should be as white as the walls. The housewife pays a visit to the cellar now and then with no errand except to look at it. The survey may give her housewifely satisfaction, and it may give her something to do or to have done. She should go with nose alert and eye keen. Is there any odour noticeable beyond that slight unavoidable cellar smell? If there is, is it a spoiled sweet potato, or clam, or a working jar of canned fruit, or--what? Find it; never rest while there is an objectionable smell in the cellar. Is there a damp spot on walls or floor? If there is the cause must be found and put an end to. If there is one near the place where the waste pipes leave the house which cannot be accounted for, send for a plumber. Is there any article out of its place? Is there any pile of things which might be looked over and in part thrown away? Is there any rubbish? Is the wood piled evenly? Is the coalbin swept up? Are the vegetables in boxes or bins and not on the floor or in corners? Are there cobwebs? Does the floor need sweeping? Are the windows clean and some of them open? If, in spite of everything one can do, the cellar smells a little musty, some unslacked lime put in a box on the floor will help it. In a cellar with an earth floor it is well sometimes to sprinkle lime in the corners and in out-of-the-way places where it will not be walked upon. Things which must stand permanently in the cellar are the better for having racks to stand upon. Barrels, ashcans, kerosene cans and cases containing bottles sometimes ooze moisture, sometimes absorb moisture from the floor; their bottoms thus become sodden and mouldy. Slats nailed on cross-pieces and laid on the floor for such things to stand upon, make the cellar and its contents more cleanly and more dry. They are a contrivance of great use and simply obtained. It is, of course, pleasant to have them made by a carpenter, but three discarded bedslats nailed on the flat sides of some short pieces of floor joist make a rack that will hold two barrels, and small racks can be made in a few minutes from the boards of a box cover nailed on the cleats that have held the box together. When the cellar floor is swept be sure to use something, preferably not water, to lay the dust. This is especially necessary when the furnace is in use. Dampened sawdust is good for this purpose. THE Before settling down to live in a place, one should know where the water supply comes from, and where waste water goes. If the water supply in a city or town comes from a far away stream or an artesian well, and the health of the community is fairly good, one may rest content. If, however, the water is notably or probably polluted, one should boil or at least filter water for drinking and cooking and in every way possible safeguard the family health from this source of danger. A sewerage system which does not carry the waste a long distance away from any dwelling is not a very good system. If one must depend upon such a system it is well to do and say everything possible to have it improved. If you live in a country place and must depend on a surface well for water, you must guard it. Have it cleaned at regular intervals; have the cover or platform over the mouth such that no creatures can get in, nor water or dust fall through; allow no rubbish nor waste water to be thrown near it; keep it well pumped off and see that pigpens, barnyards, poultryyards and closets are as far off as possible. The custom of keeping butter or other food cool by hanging it down the well is picturesque, but I can think of no other recommendation of the practice. Keep everything out of the well from frogs to custard pies. Certain very simple natural laws have been taken advantage of in getting water in and out of houses. It is an old axiom that water will not run up hill, and one would not expect it to run up a house, but another old axiom saves us from carrying rivers upstairs in pails--namely, water seeks its level. If water is poured into a U-shaped tube, it will stand just as high in one side of the U as in the other, will it not? When a house is supplied with water from a spring on the side of a hill, we have a big irregular U-tube like this dotted line. As even the garret of this house is lower than the spring, the water will have force when it comes from the pipes, that is, it could yet go higher because it has not run as far up in the U on the house side, as it is on the spring side. Sometimes, as we approach a town, we see a water tower on a hill, or a tall iron stand-pipe. They are one side of a U in a water system. Water is pumped into the tower or the stand-pipe, then it runs into the houses of the town through many pipes which are the other side of the U. There is a library of books one may read about this U performance--its relation to other laws, its limitations and the thousand uses to which it has been put. But all there is to the simple, extraordinary fact, can be seen in a bent glass tube which you can hold in your hand. The side of the U which comes into a town is no longer one pipe but many water mains in streets and multitudes of little pipes in each house. These last are part of the house plumbing. A plan of the house with the position of all the pipes indicated should be one of the housekeeper's possessions. She may not be able to do much about disordered plumbing--in fact, she had better not try to do much; it is not a safe direction for amateur effort--but such a plan is of use to workmen who come to do jobs in the house, and it may keep some zealous husband or brother from driving a nail into a gas pipe in an effort to hang a picture. Water is frequently got out of the house by giving it a good start and then letting it run down according to its nature. Waste pipes are as far as possible perpendicular, and the start is given the water by the weight of a basin or a tubful, or by the sudden emptying of the tank of the closet. That principle of the U, however, is used also in the disposal of waste water. It is the principle on which many traps are constructed. Traps are contrivances for closing the connection between a house and the public sewer. If you have an imagination, or if you will read Victor Hugo's description of the Paris sewers in 'Les Miserables' as a help to imagination, it will not be necessary to explain why this connection should be closed. To make a trap with what is known as a water-seal, the U pipe is turned into an S fallen forward,. Under the basin in the bathroom one can see the waste pipe and can imagine where the water is inside. It flows out of the basin into the first loop of the S, rises into and flows over the other loop until the basin and pipe are emptied as far as a. The water has then no power to force itself beyond the loop b, and stays in the first loop, forming a water seal between the sewer and the outlet of the basin. Through that loop water gases and odours cannot come, and across the loop at b, impure substances and water cannot force their way back from a lower level. It is well to rinse a basin, sink or tub after it is used, and one must be particular that the closet flushes generously, for the water left in the loop should be clean water. If one merely allows the water from tub or basin to sink through the outlet some of that water remains in the loop, and it is water which contains impurities washed from clothes or bodies. You see the practice of rinsing bathtubs and basins has more in it even than courtesy. Occasionally, clean, hot, strong suds should be emptied down basins, tubs, sinks and closets and allowed to stand in the loop, as this cleanses the pipe from impurities or grease which may have adhered to its sides. Disinfectant may be used in the same way when it is thought to be needed. Strong disinfectant should not be left long in a trap as it may eat the joints or even the substance of the pipes. On the other hand, in judging the quantity to use, allowance must be made for the fact that disinfectant poured down pipes goes into water, into a good deal of water in the case of the closet. Two things sometimes make traps ineffectual. One is that the loop may not be deep enough. An S like this, for instance, is useless. So much water can flow out that an air passage is left at a, and the pipe is not sealed. The other thing is that sometimes the suction of water rushing down from an upper story will draw the water out of the traps it passes on the way. Either of these difficulties can only be remedied by an alteration in the plumbing arrangements. The concern of the housekeeper in the matter is not to rest if the waste pipes give off the least odour, and to get as reliable a person as possible to inspect them. To have good plumbing is worth going without much. In truth, it is the last thing in which to exercise economy. In building a new house, it is better to have no rugs, no table-linen, and to leave two rooms unfurnished or unbuilt than to put in cheap plumbing. Besides the traps under basins, sinks, etc., there is usually a trap wherever a drain-pipe runs out of the house to the street sewer. This doubles the protection.""","""Cellar Maintenance and Water Systems""","2171","""Maintaining a cellar and ensuring a robust water system are essential components of any well-functioning property. Whether you have a basement cellar for storage or as part of your home, or a water system that delivers clean water for various uses, regular upkeep is crucial to prevent issues and ensure longevity. Let's delve into the world of cellar maintenance and water systems to explore the key aspects, best practices, and tips for efficient care.  Cellar Maintenance: Cellars are often used for storage, housing utilities, or as an additional living space. Proper maintenance is critical to prevent issues such as water damage, mold growth, pest infestation, and structural deterioration. Here are some key tips for cellar maintenance:  1. Moisture Control: Maintaining appropriate humidity levels is crucial to prevent mold and mildew growth. Use a dehumidifier to keep moisture levels in check, especially in damp environments.  2. Insulation and Ventilation: Ensure proper insulation to regulate temperature and prevent condensation. Good ventilation is essential to prevent stale air and promote air circulation.  3. Waterproofing: Inspect and repair any cracks or leaks in the walls, floors, or foundations. Consider waterproofing solutions such as sealants, coatings, or drainage systems to prevent water infiltration.  4. Pest Control: Regularly inspect for signs of pests such as rodents or insects. Seal off entry points and consider hiring professionals for pest control if needed.  5. Organization and Cleaning: Regularly declutter and organize items in the cellar to prevent a buildup of clutter. Clean the cellar periodically to maintain hygiene and prevent the accumulation of dust and debris.  Water Systems Maintenance: A reliable water system is essential for everyday activities such as drinking, cooking, cleaning, and bathing. Proper maintenance ensures the quality and efficiency of your water supply. Here are some key aspects of maintaining water systems:  1. Plumbing Inspection: Regularly check for leaks, drips, or signs of water damage in pipes, faucets, and fixtures. Repair or replace any damaged components to prevent water wastage and potential water damage.  2. Water Quality Testing: Periodically test the water quality to ensure it meets safety standards. Consider testing for contaminants such as lead, bacteria, or chemicals to ensure safe drinking water.  3. Water Heater Maintenance: Flush the water heater tank annually to remove sediment buildup and maintain efficiency. Inspect the heating elements and thermostat regularly for optimal performance.  4. Well Maintenance: If you have a well water system, regular maintenance is crucial. Inspect the well, pump, and pressure tank for any issues. Test the water quality and consider well disinfection if needed.  5. Water Softener and Filtration Systems: Maintain water softeners by refilling salt regularly and cleaning the resin bed. Change filters in filtration systems per manufacturer's recommendations to ensure effective filtration.  In conclusion, cellar maintenance and water system care are vital aspects of property upkeep.

"Köppen Fedor von","""The shells are of the German pattern, but the shrapnel have fewer bullets than the German ones. Besides these projectiles, case-shot, fire-shells, and so-called high-angle shells, for bursting among troops behind cover, are carried with the battery. The Garrison Artillery numbers 2 battalions, each of Field and Depot-cadre companies. Eighteen more battalions have been projected, and will be formed in the course of the next few years according to the amount of money in hand. The uniform of the Artillery is dark-brown. The men are armed with sword and revolver, those of the Garrison Artillery carrying the Werndl rifle instead. The Corps of Engineers is composed of the Engineer Staff and Engineer troops. The former is exclusively composed of officers; the latter of regiments of battalions each. Each battalion has Field, Reserve, and Depot-cadre companies. The Pioneer Regiment, not considered as Engineers, consists of battalions, similarly constituted to the Engineer battalions. The Railway and Telegraph Regiment, which has but recently been formed, after the German model, consists of Field and Depot-cadre battalions. The Train consists of regiments of squadrons each and a Depot-cadre. There is no Guard Corps in the Austrian Army, so several bodies of troops have been formed for the honour of protecting the Emperor person and guarding his palaces. These are the Arcieren squadron of Life-Guards, the Hungarian Body-Guard, the Trabanten Body-Guard, the squadron of Horse-Guards, and the Infantry Company of the Guard. These troops are richly dressed in peculiar uniforms. The Landwehr is formed into two distinct bodies, which are also quite distinct from the Active Army; each Landwehr is under its own ministry of defence. In peace-time only the cadres exist; that is to say, that of 2 Infantry battalions and Cavalry Cis-Leithanian Landwehr, only strong company per battalion and strong squadron per Cavalry Regiment are kept up. The Native the Tyrol and Vorarlberg consist of 0 battalions in time of peace, which are in war-time increased by ten Reserve battalions. In Trans-Leithania the Landwehr forms a peculiar national Hungarian Army, the so-called Honved Army, which is subject in war-time only to the commander-in-chief, and in peace-time only to the Royal Hungarian jurisdiction, i.e. the Ministry of Defence and the Landwehr Ministry. It forms in peace-time the Cadres for 2 battalions of Infantry and 5/8 regiments of Honved her arms, pain and courage depicted on her noble countenance, she advanced towards the Hungarian nobles, and in a powerful Latin speech asked for the National Army to be called out, to protect her and her country from her many foes. Then the Hungarian magnates tore their crooked swords from their scabbards, clashed them wildly together, and shouted: Moriamur pro rege nostro Maria Theresa! With the help of her brave Hungarians, Maria Theresa, after making peace with Frederick II. of Prussia, succeeded in beating off her numerous enemies. If we consider that the total the Austro-Hungarian Army, Line and Landwehr included, exceeds one million of trained men, of which 78,89 belong to the st Line, and we remember that the Cis-Leithanians are in no way inferior in warlike spirit, that inheritance of their forefathers, to their brethren on the far side of the Leitha, we shall come to the conclusion that in the Austrian Army, with its excellent Corps of officers and excellent material in the shape of men and horses, any State in Europe would find either a powerful adversary or a most desirable ally.:. In Italy we have the third of the Powers who have formed the Triple Alliance in order to maintain the peace of Europe and to make common cause against any disturber thereof. The history of this country has been very similar to that of Germany. In this instance also, an energetic Prince, King Victor Emmanuel of, and the rd class men are called out every four years for a few days at a time for instruction in the use and manipulation of their arms. The Standing Army consists accordingly of eight yearly batches of the st class and eight of the nd class; the Landwehr of four yearly batches of men who have served their time in the Standing Army, and four batches of the nd class; and the Landsturm comprises seven batches of the st, seven of the nd, and nineteen of the rd class. The Infantry of the Standing Army consists of 6 an excellent repeating rifle, the Vitali. Particular attention is paid to musketry instruction, and facilities for shooting are given and encouraged by the holding of National Rifle Meetings at stated times. At these meetings, any soldier on furlough is allowed to compete, with his Service rifle. The Cavalry of the Italian Army, on account of the scarcity of useful horses, and the mountainous character of the land, is weak in comparison with the Cavalry of other European armies. It consists of 4 regiments, each of squadrons and an Ersatz-cadre; i.e., 0 Lancer regiments and 4 regiments of Light Cavalry (Cavalleggieri). The Light Cavalry are armed with a long curved sword, and the Lancers with a lance. In addition to these weapons, the whole of the Cavalry is armed with a rifled breech-loading carbine.""","""Austro-Hungarian Army Structure and Equipment""","1142","""The Austro-Hungarian Army of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was a complex organization with a unique structure and a variety of equipment. Established in 1867 following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, this military force was tasked with maintaining the Dual Monarchy's territorial integrity and defending its borders. The army's structure and equipment reflected the empire's diverse ethnic and cultural makeup, as well as its strategic challenges in an era marked by rapid technological advancements.   At the top of the Austro-Hungarian Army's hierarchy was the Emperor, who served as the Commander-in-Chief. Under him was the Minister of War, responsible for overseeing the army's administration and strategic direction. The army was divided into a number of corps based on geographical regions, with each corps consisting of divisions and brigades. These units were further subdivided into regiments, battalions, and companies, each with its own specific operational roles and responsibilities.   One of the distinctive features of the Austro-Hungarian Army was its multi-ethnic composition. Soldiers came from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, including Austrians, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Ukrainians, Romanians, Croats, and others. This diversity posed unique challenges for the army's leadership, as officers and soldiers often had to communicate in multiple languages and navigate cultural differences within their units.  The army's equipment varied depending on the specific branch and role of the unit. Infantry units were equipped with rifles, bayonets, and hand grenades, while artillery units had cannons of various calibers. Cavalry units were outfitted with sabers, lances, and pistols, and engineers had tools for fortification and demolition tasks. The Austro-Hungarian Army also utilized various types of uniforms and insignia to distinguish between different units and ranks.  In terms of technology, the Austro-Hungarian Army lagged behind some of its more industrialized European counterparts. While it had adopted repeating rifles and machine guns by the early 20th century, its artillery and logistical capabilities were often outdated compared to those of other major powers. This technological gap would prove to be a significant disadvantage for the army during World War I, especially on the Eastern Front against the more modern Russian forces.  The Austro-Hungarian Army's tactics and doctrine were influenced by its experience in previous conflicts, such as the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The army placed a strong emphasis on defensive warfare, relying on fortifications and rugged terrain to offset its technological disadvantages. However, this approach proved to be insufficient against the combined might of the Entente powers during World War I, leading to a series of costly defeats and the eventual collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Despite its ultimate defeat and dissolution at the end of World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Army left a lasting legacy in terms of its organizational structure and its impact on the region's military history. The army's unique blend of ethnic diversity, traditional tactics, and evolving technology reflects the complex nature of the Dual Monarchy and its place in the broader history of Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.""","650"
"Hopkins Mark","""'We ought to obey God rather than men.' I have thus shown, as fully as the time would permit, though far too briefly to do justice to the subject, the grounds on which we ought to obey God rather than men. These are to be found in the relation of the divine, and of human government respectively, to the ends of individual, and of social existence. But the occasion on which the text was uttered, a subject having directly refused obedience to rulers lawfully constituted, will lead us to consider the effects of the principle of the text when acted upon by men in those relations in which civil liberty is directly involved--in the relations of subjects and of rulers. What then will be the effect of an adherence to this principle on the part of subjects, as such? There is a tendency in irresponsible power to accumulate. It first gains control over property, and life, and every thing from which a motive to resistance based on the interests of the present life, could be drawn. But it is not satisfied with this. Nothing avails it so long as there is a Mordecai sitting at the King's gate that does not rise up and do it reverence. It must also control the conscience, and make the religious nature subservient to its purposes. Accordingly, the grand device of the enemies of civil liberty, has been so to incorporate religion with the government, that all those deep and ineradicable feelings which are associated with the one, should also be associated with the other, and that he who opposed the government should not only bring upon himself the arm of the civil power, but also the fury of religious zeal. The most melancholy and heart-sickening chapter in the history of man, is that in which are recorded the enormities committed by a lust of power, and by malignity, in alliance with a perverted religious sentiment. The light that was in men has become darkness, and that darkness has been great. The very instrument appointed by God for the deliverance and elevation of man, has been made to assist in his thraldom and degradation. When christianity appeared, the alliance of religion with oppressive power was universal. In such a state of things, there seemed no hope for civil liberty but in bringing the conscience out from this unholy alliance, and putting it in a position in which it must show its energies in opposition to power. This Christianity did. It brought the conscience to a point where it not only might resist human governments, but where, as they were then exercised, it was compelled to resist them. This appeared when the text was uttered, and there was then a rock raised in the ocean of tyranny which has not been overflowed to this day. The same qualities which make the conscience so potent an ally of power, must, when it is enlightened by a true knowledge of God and of duty, and when immortality is clearly set before the mind, make it the most formidable of all barriers to tyranny and oppression. By thus bringing the moral nature of man to act in opposition to power, and by giving him light, and strength, and foothold, to enable him to sustain that opposition, christianity has done an inestimable service, and has placed humanity at the only point where its highest grandeur appears. At this point, sustained by principle, and often in the person of the humblest individual, it bids defiance to all the malice of men to wrest from it its true liberty. It bids tyranny do its worst, and though its ashes may be scattered to the winds, it leaves its startling testimony, and the inspiration of its great example to coming times. The power to do this, christianity alone can give. No other religion has ever so demonstrated its evidences to the senses, and caused its adaptations to the innermost wants of the soul to be felt, as to enable man to stand alone against the influence of whatever was dear in affection, and flattering in promises, and fearful in torture. Other religions have had their victims, who have been led, amidst the plaudits of surrounding multitudes, to throw themselves under the wheels of a system already established; but not their martyrs, who, when duty has permitted it, have fled to the fastnesses of the mountains; and when it has not, have stood upon their rights, and contested every inch of ground, and met death soberly and firmly, only when it was necessary. When this has been done by multitudes it has caused power to respect the individual, to respect humanity; and while christianity was wading through the blood of ten persecutions, it was fighting more effectually than had ever been done before, the battles of civil liberty. The call to obey God rather than men met with a response, and it is upon this ground that the battle has been opened in every case in which civil liberty now exists. It is upon this ground alone that it can be maintained. I deem it of great importance that this point should be fully and often presented, because it is vital, and because there are constant attempts made to obscure it. Whatever elevates the individual, whatever gives him worth in his own estimation and that of others, whatever invests him with moral dignity, must be favorable both to pure morality and to civil liberty. Hence it is that these are both incidental results of christianity. They are not the gifts which she came to bestow--these are life and immortality. They are not the white raiment in which her followers are to walk in the upper temple; but they are the earthly garments with which she would clothe the nations--they are the brightness which she leaves in her train as she moves on towards heaven, and calls on men to follow her there. These belong to her alone. Infidels may filch her morality, as they have often done, and then boast of their discoveries. But in their hands that morality is lopped off from the body of faith on which it grew, and produces no fruit. They may boast, as they do, of a liberty which they never could have achieved. But under its protection they advance doctrines and advocate practices which would corrupt it into license. Their only strength lies in endeavoring, in the sacred name of liberty, to corrupt the virtuous, and to excite the hatred of the vicious against those restraints without which liberty cannot exist, and society has no ground of security. 'Promising liberty to others, they are themselves the servants of corruption.' Liberty cannot exist without morality, nor general morality without a pure religion. The doctrine thus stated is fully confirmed by history. The reformation by Luther was made on strictly religious grounds. He found an opposition between the decrees of the Pope and the commands of God, and it was the simple purpose, resolutely adhered to, to obey God rather than men, that caused Europe to rock to its centre. In the train of this religious reformation civil liberty followed, but became settled and valuable only as religious liberty was perfected. It was every where on the ground of conscience towards God that the first stand was taken, and in those countries where the struggle for religious liberty commenced but did not succeed, as in Spain and Italy, civil liberty has found no resting place for the sole of her foot to this day. It is conceded even by Hume that England owes her civil liberty to the Puritans, and the history of the settlement and progress of this country as a splendid exemplification of the principle in question, needs but to be mentioned here. In speaking thus of the resistance of christian subjects to the government, perhaps I should guard against being misunderstood. In no case can it be a factious resistance. It cannot be stimulated by any of the ordinary motives to such resistance--by discontent, or passion, or ambition, or a love of gain. In no case can it show itself in the disorganizing, the aggressive, and in a free government, the suicidal spirit of mobs. Christians have in their eye a grand and a holy object, and all they wish is to go forward, without violating the rights of others, to its attainment. In so doing they set themselves in opposition to nobody, but merely exercise an inalienable right, and if others oppose them, they must still go forward and obey God, be the consequences what they may. We will now consider, as was proposed, the effect of an adherence to the principle of the text on the part of rulers. This becomes appropriate from the peculiar form of our government, and the relation which the rulers hold to the people. Rulers have indeed, in all countries, need to be exhorted to obey God, but when their will is supreme, and their power is independent of the people, there can be no propriety in exhorting them to obey God rather than men. In this country, however, this principle needs to be enforced upon legislators and rulers quite as much as upon the people, perhaps even more. It is at this point, if I mistake not, that we are to look for the danger peculiar to our institutions through those in authority. In other countries the danger is from the accumulation and tyrannical use of power. With us, limited as is the tenure of office, there is little danger of direct oppression. The danger is that those who are in office, and those who wish for it, will, for the sake of immediate popularity, lend the sanction of their names to doctrines and practices, which, if carried into effect, must destroy all government. How is it else that mobs should often escape with so little rebuke? How is it else that we hear such extravagant and disorganizing doctrines maintained in regard to the rights of a majority respecting property, and their power to set aside any guaranties of former Legislatures? Certainly the people are the fountain of power. They establish the government, they have a right to alter it; but when it is established, the state becomes personified through it, and its acts are to be consistent.""","""Obeying God over human authority""","2026","""When faced with the decision of obeying God over human authority, individuals are often placed in a moral dilemma that tests their faith and convictions. This conflict has roots in various religious beliefs and ethical frameworks that prioritize divine guidance and laws above those enforced by human institutions. The debate over whether one should prioritize obedience to God or submission to human authorities is a complex and deeply personal issue that has been pondered for centuries by theologians, philosophers, and ordinary individuals seeking to navigate conflicting expectations.  In many religious traditions, the idea of obeying God over human authority is central to the moral compass of believers. For Christians, the Bible teaches in Romans 13:1-7 the importance of submitting to governing authorities as they are established by God. However, this obedience is not absolute and is subject to the higher authority of God Himself. When faced with a choice between following a law or command that contradicts the teachings of one's faith, many Christians believe that they must prioritize their allegiance to God.  Similarly, in Islam, the concept of **""""Ta’at Allah""""** (obedience to God) holds significant weight in shaping the actions and decisions of Muslims. While Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of respecting and obeying legitimate authority figures, including rulers and leaders, this obedience does not extend to actions that go against the principles of Islam. Muslims are expected to prioritize obedience to Allah and His commandments, even if it means disobeying human authorities.  Judaism also places a strong emphasis on obeying God's laws above all else. The Torah serves as a guide for Jewish beliefs and practices, highlighting the significance of following divine commandments regardless of societal norms or expectations. Jewish teachings often underscore the need for individuals to uphold their faith in the face of adversity, even if it means standing up against human authorities.  Beyond specific religious doctrines, the concept of obeying God over human authority resonates with individuals seeking to uphold their ethical integrity and principles. The idea that there are universal truths or moral absolutes that transcend human laws is a compelling argument for many who believe in a higher power or moral order governing the universe. This perspective challenges individuals to critically evaluate the ethical implications of their actions and decisions, prompting them to consider the greater good and moral righteousness.  In contemporary society, the tension between obeying God and complying with human authority is evident in various contexts. From conscientious objection in the military to civil disobedience in the face of unjust laws, individuals continually grapple with the moral implications of choosing between divine commandments and societal expectations. The legacy of moral exemplars like Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela underscores the power of individuals who choose to prioritize their convictions and beliefs over the pressures of human authority.  At the heart of the debate lies the question of moral autonomy and ethical responsibility. How does one navigate conflicting demands of conscience and duty when faced with divergent sources of authority? Is it possible to reconcile obedience to God with respect for human institutions and laws? These are profound questions that require careful reflection and consideration, as individuals seek to live lives that are both faithful to their beliefs and responsible members of society.  While the decision to obey God over human authority may come with personal sacrifices and challenges, it is often regarded as a path to spiritual fulfillment and moral integrity. By choosing to uphold one's faith and values even in the face of opposition or persecution, individuals demonstrate their commitment to a higher moral standard that transcends temporal concerns. This unwavering conviction can serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for others facing similar dilemmas, illustrating the transformative power of faith and obedience to divine principles.  Ultimately, the choice to obey God over human authority is a deeply personal one that reflects an individual's deepest beliefs, values, and convictions. Whether motivated by religious teachings, ethical principles, or a sense of moral duty, the decision to prioritize divine guidance can be a profound expression of faith and commitment. In a world marked by shifting values and changing norms, the steadfast adherence to divine laws and commandments stands as a powerful testament to the enduring significance of obedience to a higher authority.""","823"
"Webster Marie D  Marie Daugherty ","""This work is well done, and the pose of both man and horse shows spirit. It is said to have been made during the thirteenth century. Preserved to us from this same period is the tattered fragment of a coat worn by Edward, the Black Prince, and which now hangs over his tomb in Canterbury Cathedral. With it are the helmet and gauntlets he wore and the shield he carried. The coat is of a red and blue velvet, now sadly faded, applied to a calico background and closely quilted. It is too elaborate to have been made to wear under his armour, and was probably worn during state functions where armour was not required, although it was then customary to wear thickly padded and quilted coats and hoods in order to ease the weight of the heavy and unyielding coats of mail. Much of the best needlework in England at this early period was for the church. Neither labour nor expense was spared to make the magnificent decorations used in the old cathedrals. Aside from the linens, silks, and velvets used in this construction, much gold and silver bullion was wrought into the elaborate altar hangings, altar fronts, and ecclesiastical vestments. In their ornamentation applied work was freely used, especially on the large hangings draped over the altar. It was during the earliest period that the Latin name opus consutum was commonly used to designate patchwork. Chain stitch also was much used on early English embroidery; to such an extent that it is now of great service as an identification mark to fix the dates of medieval needlework. Chain stitch was dignified by the Latin name opus anglicanum. Only the most elaborate and richest of embroideries have been preserved; the reason being that much of the work was done with silver and gold threads which were in reality fine wires of these precious metals. Being exceedingly costly, they were given unusual care, many being kept with the royal plate and jewels. One specimen made in 05/8 by Aelfled, the queen of Edward, the Elder, is now treasured in Durham Cathedral. It is described as being 'of almost solid gold thread, so exquisitely embroidered that it resembles a fine illuminated manuscript,' and is indescribably beautiful. In many instances the fabrics of these old embroideries have partly fallen away, leaving only frail fragments of the original material held together by the lasting threads of gold and silver. The great amount of precious metals used in making the richest garments and hangings sometimes made them objects to be desired by avaricious invaders. In an inventory of the contents of Cardinal Wolsey's great palace at Hampton Court there are mentioned, among many other rare specimens of needlework of that period, '30 bed hangings of English embroidery.' None of them is now in existence, and it is supposed that they were torn apart in order to fill the coffers of some vandal who preferred the metal in them to their beauty as hangings. Among the sumptuous furnishings belonging to the Tudor period, applied work held a prominent place. Vast spaces of cold palace walls were covered by great wall hangings, archways were screened, and every bed was enclosed with curtains made of stoutly woven material, usually more or less ornamented. This was before the advent of French tapestry, which later supplanted the English applique wall draperies. The Tudor period was also the time when great rivalry in dress existed. 'The esquire endeavoured to outshine the knight, the knight the baron, the baron the earl, the earl the king himself, in the richness of his apparel.' In direct contrast to the long inventories of beautiful and valuable clothing, bedcovers, and hangings of the rich, are the meagre details relating to the life and household effects of the landless English peasant. In all probability he copied as far as he was able some of the utilities and comforts used by his superiors. If he possessed a cover for his bed, it was doubtless made of the cheapest woven material obtainable. No doubt the pieced or patched quilt contributed materially to his comfort. In 'Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages,' Julia de Wolf Addison describes a child's bed quilt included in an inventory of furniture at the Priory in Durham in 446, 'which was embroidered in the four corners with the Evangelistic symbols.' In the 'Squier of Lowe Degree,' a fifteenth-century romance, there is allusion to a bed of which the head sheet is described as embroidered 'with diamonds and rubies bright.' It was during the gorgeous reign of Henry VIII that the finest specimens of combined embroidery and patchwork, now preserved in various museums, were made. It was really patch upon patch, for before the motives were applied to the foundation they were elaborately embroidered in intricate designs; and after being applied, they had their edges couched with gold and silver cord and ornate embroidery stitches. Mrs. Lowes relates in 'Old Lace and Needlework' that, during the time of Henry VIII, embroidery, as distinct from garment making, appeared; and every article of wearing apparel became an object worthy of decoration. 'Much fine stitching was put into the fine white undergarments of that time, and the overdresses of both men and women became stiff with gold thread and jewels. Much use was made of slashing and quilting, the point of junction being dotted with pearls and precious stones. Noble ladies wore dresses heavily and richly embroidered with gold, and the train was so weighty that train bearers were pressed into service. In the old paintings the horses belonging to kings and nobles wear trappings of heavily embroidered gold. Even the hounds, which are frequently represented with their masters, have collars massively decorated with gold bullion.' Mary, Queen of Scots, was devoted to the needle and was expert in its use. It is said that while in France she learned lace making and embroidery. Many wall hangings, bed draperies, bedcovers, and house linens are the work of her skilful fingers, or were made under her personal direction. A number of examples of her work are now owned by the Duke of Devonshire. It is said also that many of the French costumes and laces of her wardrobe were appropriated by Queen Elizabeth, who had little sympathy for the unfortunate queen. As a solace during long days of loneliness, Queen Mary found consolation in her needle, as have many women of lower degree before and since her unhappy time. She stands forth as the most expert and indefatigable of royal needleworkers. Hardwick Hall is intimately associated with Queen Mary's life, and is rich in relics of her industry. In one room named for her there are bed curtains and a quilt said to be her own work. Extracts from old letters relating to her conduct during captivity show how devoted she was to her needlework. An attendant, on being asked how the queen passed her time, wrote, 'that all day she wrought with her nydil and that the diversity of the colours made the work seem less tedious and that she contynued so long at it that veray payn made hir to give over.' This shows that fatigue alone made her desist from her beloved work. There is a very interesting fragment of a bed hanging at Hardwick Hall said to have been made by Queen Mary. It is of applied patchwork, with cream-coloured medallions curiously ornamented by means of designs singed with a hot iron upon the light-coloured velvet. The singed birds, flowers, and butterflies are outlined with black silk thread. The worked medallions are applied to a foundation of green velvet, ornamented between and around them with yellow silk cord. This is only one of a number of examples of curious and beautiful patchwork still in existence and attributed to the Tudor period. Queen Elizabeth herself was not devoted to needlework, but judging from the accounts of the gorgeous costumes which she delighted to wear, she was one of its greatest patronesses. It is said that at her death she left one of the most extensive wardrobes of history: in it were more than a thousand dresses, which were most voluminous in style and elaborately trimmed with bullion, pearls, and jewels. Before the precious stones were applied, her garments were solidly covered with gold and silver quilting and embroidery, which made them so heavy as to be a noticeable burden even for this proud and ambitious queen. In Berkeley Castle, as prized mementoes of Queen Elizabeth, are five white linen cushions beautifully embroidered with silver threads and cherry-coloured silk. Also with them is the quilt, a wonderful piece of needlework, that matches the hangings of the bed wherein she slept. The magnificence of Queen Elizabeth's reign gave great impetus to all kinds of needlework. France at that time led in the development of fine arts, and furnished many of the skilled workmen employed by the nobility solely as embroiderers. There seemed to be no limit to the ambitions of these workers, and the gorgeous results of their labours were beyond anything attempted after them. To those who wish to study the work of the Tudor period, Hardwick Hall is recommended as the place where the best specimens have been preserved. To Elizabeth, daughter of John Hardwick, born in 5/820, and so poor that her marriage portion as the bride of the Earl of Shrewsbury was only thirty pounds, credit is given for the richness of this collection.""","""Medieval English embroidery and textiles""","1954","""During the medieval period in England, embroidery and textiles played a significant role in the lives of both the nobility and the common people. Embroidery was not just a form of decoration but also a means of communication, showcasing one's wealth, status, and even political affiliations. Textiles, on the other hand, provided warmth, comfort, and served as a symbol of social standing. Let's explore the intricate world of medieval English embroidery and textiles, delving into their techniques, significance, and evolution over time.  Embroidery in medieval England was a highly regarded art form that reached its peak during the 12th and 13th centuries. The skilled artisans who created these intricate works were often women, including noblewomen who practiced embroidery as part of their education. The techniques used in medieval embroidery included intricate stitching, appliqué, weaving, and beadwork. Gold and silver threads were often used to embellish garments and textiles, adding a touch of luxury and opulence.  One of the most famous examples of medieval English embroidery is the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the events leading up to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Despite its name, the Bayeux Tapestry is not a true tapestry but an embroidered cloth that measures over 70 meters long. The level of detail and storytelling in the Bayeux Tapestry showcases the skill and artistry of medieval embroiderers.  Embroidery was not only used for decorative purposes but also had symbolic meanings. Heraldic embroidery, for example, featured coats of arms and family crests, serving as a way to display one's lineage and allegiance. Religious embroidery, such as altar cloths and vestments, was also common, with intricate designs depicting biblical scenes and saints.  In addition to embroidery, textiles played a crucial role in medieval English society. Wool was the dominant textile fiber during this period, with England being known for its high-quality wool production. The wool trade brought wealth to the country and facilitated the growth of towns such as York and Norwich, which became centers of textile production.  Medieval textiles were not just limited to wool, as silk, linen, and cotton were also used for clothing and household items. Textiles were dyed using natural materials such as plants, insects, and minerals, resulting in a rich array of colors. Sumptuary laws regulated the types of fabrics and colors that different social classes could wear, further emphasizing the importance of textiles as status symbols.  The production of textiles involved a complex supply chain, from shearing sheep to spinning yarn, weaving fabric, and finally producing garments. Guilds, such as the Worshipful Company of Weavers in London, played a crucial role in regulating the textile industry and maintaining quality standards.  As the medieval period progressed, advancements in textile production led to the rise of more sophisticated weaving techniques, such as the use of draw looms and jacquard looms. These innovations allowed for more intricate patterns and designs to be woven into fabrics, further elevating the artistry of medieval textiles.  In conclusion, embroidery and textiles in medieval England were not just practical necessities but also expressions of creativity, skill, and social status. The craftsmanship and artistry of medieval embroiderers and weavers continue to inspire us today, reminding us of a time when textiles were not just everyday objects but works of art imbued with meaning and symbolism.""","681"
"Blanco A E ","""It is based on the finished yarn, and singles and two and three cord yarns of the same number have all the same number of yards per pound. Thus:-- No. 0 singles has 2,00 yards per pound. ' ' 2,00 ' ' ' ' 2,00 ' ' =Sliver.=--A continuous strand of cotton or other fibre in a loose, untwisted condition, ready for the further process of slubbing or roving, preparatory to being spun. =Spanish Stripes, Cotton.=--A plain-woven all-cotton fabric, sometimes woven from dyed yarns, but oftenest met with as a piece-dyed material woven with a simple one-over and one-under weave. The selvedge is often woven with black warp threads to the width of about inch. The filling weft threads are soft and full, the warp threads are much finer and hard-twisted. The surface is raised and the general appearance of the fabric is similar to Flannelette. Often met with in bright vermilion. Average width, 6 inches; length, 5/8 yards per piece; and the rest of the warp threads or weft filling threads. These coloured warp threads go towards making generally three separate coloured stripes in the selvedge and have given rise to the name of this particular fabric. In width measuring up to 2 inches and with a length of 9 to 0 yards per piece, Woollen Spanish Stripes are met with in a limited range of quality and the average price of same taken over the period 904 to 914 was s. 1/2d. per yard. =Spanish Stripes, Wool and Cotton.=--This class of fabric, being a mixture and not a union fabric, answers to the description of a Woollen Spanish Stripe but differs from it in that it is woven from yarns which are composed of a mixture of wool and cotton. The 'handle' is very nearly that of an all-wool fabric, the average width some 2 inches, and the length per piece 9 to 0 yards. The distinctive selvedge of this class of fabric is maintained in the wool and cotton variety. =Split Foot.=--Refers to black or coloured hosiery having a white or unbleached sole. =Sponge Cloth.=--A fine cotton or wool fabric having a surface resembling that of a small sponge. =Spun Silk.=--Applied to a low grade of silk used in the cheaper lines of silk hosiery. It is made from floss, injured cocoons, husks, and waste from reeling, and bears the same relation to silk as cotton waste to cotton or shoddy to wool. =Staples.=--Staples is a term used to designate those fabrics which are woven in the same way year after year, varying only in the colouring given to them, which may change in accordance with the demands of fashion and of the buyer. The principal dress goods staples are Brilliantines, Sicilians, Mohairs, Imperial Serges, Storm Serges, Cheviots, Panamas, Batistes, Taffetas, Voile, Muslins, Nun's Veiling, Cashmere, and Shepherd's Checks. =Surah.=--A light, soft, twilled silk. =Swansdown.=--Like Cotton Flannel and Flannelette, Swansdown is a fabric made of cotton with a 'raised' or 'napped' surface. Being raised but on the back of the cloth, it is 'single raised': heavy and closely woven Swansdown is a typical raised cotton cloth. The weave is on the satin-weave principle. =Swiss Embroidery.=--This process of ornamentation closely resembles lappet spots, but, unlike lappet spots, they are in reality the result of a subsequent process of weaving. The essential difference in the manner of attaching the thread which is used for the figuring to the cloth can readily be seen. In Swiss Embroidery there is an equal amount of floating thread used to form the spot on the face of the cloth and on the back, thus producing what may be termed a solid spot on both sides and therefore reversible. =Swivel Figures.=--High-class fabrics are often ornamented with swivel spots and figures, which are easily distinguished from the lappet or extra warp figures. In this style the figure is interwoven with extra weft by small shuttles into the ground cloth structure. Each figure is produced by an independent weft thread quite distinct from the weft pick forming the ground structure or body of the fabric. The figure threads are well bound into the cloth, the bulk of the material being on the surface. Where no figure is required in the space between, the shuttles remain idle in the loom, and the single thread from each shuttle joining the swivel figures is often cut away. Often used where a silk figure or a mercerised cotton figure is required on a cotton or worsted ground. =Tapestry.=--A yarn-dyed figured fabric composed of two sets of warp and weft threads, woven on a Jacquard loom. =T-Cloth.=--An all-cotton plain-woven fabric, usually woven from low-quality yarns, generally sold in the grey or unbleached state. Most of the T-Cloth imported into China is a heavily sized cheap grey cloth, usually 0 to 2 inches wide, 4 yards per piece, with a woven coloured heading somewhat similar to the heading in Grey Shirtings. Some T-Cloth is imported measuring 6 inches wide by 4 or 0 yards per piece. These Grey T-Cloths are generally packed 0 to 5/8 pieces per bale. Bleached T-Cloths, 1 and 6 inches wide, are also imported in small quantities. These are generally packed in cases of 0 pieces. The fabric derives its name from the mark @T@ under which it was first exported. T-Cloth is also known as 'Mexican.' =Teasels, or Teazels.=--Thistleheads with curved bracts, used in cloth raising. =Terry Cloth.=--A weave in looped effect. A Velvet in which the loops have not been cut. Frequently applied to cotton fabrics of the order of Agaric and Sponge Cloth. See Turkish Towelling. =Tests by Burning.=--Yarns or fibres of different origin burn in different manner. Cotton, linen, ramie, rhea, china grass, etc., ignite and burn readily with a bright smokeless and odourless flame, leaving but a small amount of ash, this being the characteristic of vegetable fibres. Animal fibres, on the other hand, are slower to ignite, the appearance of the flame is lifeless, and the fibres burn more slowly than vegetable fibres. Wool, when burnt, emits a disagreeable odour, and the residue or ash takes the form of a bead or knob. Silk burns in the same way as wool when it is free of 'weighting.' When artificially weighted, silk may have its weight increased to almost any desired extent--from 0 to 00 per cent. increase in weight can be obtained without creating suspicion. When such weighted silk is burnt, instead of forming itself into small black beads or knobs, it burns leaving a distinct ash, which retains somewhat the shape of the original material. Artificial or cellulose silk burns readily and in burning does not give off any odour. =Test for Artificial Silk.=--The burning test should in most cases be sufficient to distinguish artificial from true silk, but if a chemical test is necessary, by immersing the suspect sample in a caustic potash solution it will be seen that artificial silk turns yellow, whereas true silk does not change colour. Artificial silk, which is a nitro-cellulose, burns very rapidly, leaving practically no ash whatever. A simple way of recognising artificial silk is by testing the threads under moisture. Unravel a few threads of the suspected fabric and place them in the mouth and masticate them thoroughly. Artificial silk readily softens under this operation and breaks up into minute particles, and when pulled between the fingers shows no thread, but merely a mass of cellulose or pulp. Natural silk, no matter how thoroughly masticated, will retain its fibrous strength. =Tests for Linen.=--Linen, like cotton, burns when a light is applied, leaving a white ash. Linen yarns are more irregular in their thickness longitudinally than cotton thread taken from similar woven fabrics. This difference makes the detection of linen in a woven cloth comparatively easy. The fibres are straighter, longer, and stronger when separated in the thread than cotton. The threads often snap sharp and clear when breaking them in the fingers. The oil test for linen is based upon the property which linen has of more readily absorbing oil than cotton does. When a linen and cotton mixture fabric which has been freed from dressing by washing and boiling is dipped in oil and then held up to the light it will be seen that the linen fibres look transparent, whereas the cotton remains more nearly opaque. This is due to the linen having absorbed the oil more readily than the cotton. All the cotton contained in a linen and cotton fabric can be readily dissolved by dipping the fabric in a concentrated sulphuric acid bath for one or two minutes. The sample is first freed of dressing. After washing and drying a sample so tested the linen fibre only will remain. =Test for Mercerised Cotton.=--Prepare a solution made by dissolving 1/4 ounces of iodide of potassium in ounces of water, then add to this solution 1/2 ounce of iodine, and mix with another solution made by dissolving 1/2 ounces of zinc chloride in ounces of water. The test is applied as follows: take the suspect sample and free it from any dressing or sizing by soaking it in water; then, after freeing the sample from any superfluous water, place it in some of the prepared solution for three minutes, and then rinse the sample in water. Should the cotton tested have been mercerised it will appear of a deep blue colour. On washing with water the blue colour fades very slowly and needs long washing, whereas ordinary cotton rapidly becomes white on washing.""","""Textiles and Fabrics Manufacturing Processes""","2133","""Textiles and fabrics are essential components of our daily lives, playing significant roles in clothing, home furnishings, and various industrial applications. The manufacturing processes involved in creating textiles and fabrics are intricate and diverse, encompassing a range of techniques from fiber production to the final finishing touches. Understanding these processes is key to appreciating the complexity and artistry behind the fabrics we encounter every day.  The journey of textile manufacturing begins with the selection of raw materials, which can be natural, synthetic, or a blend of both. Natural fibers like cotton, wool, silk, and linen are derived from plants or animals and undergo processes such as harvesting, ginning, and scouring to prepare them for spinning. Synthetic fibers like polyester, nylon, and acrylic are chemically created through extrusion processes that convert raw materials into filaments suitable for spinning.  Spinning is the process where the prepared fibers are drawn out and twisted together to form yarn. There are two main methods of spinning: ring spinning and open-end spinning. Ring spinning is a traditional method that produces high-quality yarn by twisting fibers with a spindle and a ring. In contrast, open-end spinning is a more modern, high-speed method that directly converts fibers into yarn without the need for a spindle, making it more cost-effective for mass production.  Once the yarn is spun, it undergoes additional processes like plying, where multiple yarns are twisted together for strength, and dyeing, where the yarn is colored using various dyeing techniques such as vat dyeing, continuous dyeing, or space dyeing. Dyeing is a crucial step that adds color and aesthetics to the yarn before it is woven into fabric.  Weaving and knitting are the two primary methods used to create fabric from yarn. Weaving involves interlacing two sets of yarn – the warp (longitudinal) and the weft (transverse) – on a loom to create a stable fabric structure. There are different types of weaving techniques, such as plain, twill, and satin weaves, each producing a distinct fabric texture and appearance. Knitting, on the other hand, uses a series of interconnected loops to create fabrics like jerseys, rib knits, and jacquards, offering versatility in fabric design and stretch.  After the fabric is woven or knitted, it undergoes finishing processes to enhance its properties and appearance. Finishing processes include treatments like bleaching, mercerization, and singeing to improve the fabric's brightness, strength, and surface smoothness. Additional treatments like printing, embossing, and coating can also be applied to add patterns, textures, or functionalities to the fabric.  Textile manufacturing also involves nonwoven processes, where fibers are bonded together using techniques like needle punching, spunlacing, or thermal bonding to create fabrics without traditional weaving or knitting. Nonwoven fabrics are used in applications like hygiene products, filtration materials, and geotextiles due to their unique properties like high strength, absorbency, and breathability.  In recent years, sustainable practices have become increasingly important in textile manufacturing. Eco-friendly initiatives focus on reducing water consumption, using biodegradable fibers, and implementing recycling programs to minimize the environmental impact of textile production. Innovations like recycled polyester, organic cotton, and closed-loop manufacturing processes are examples of sustainable practices gaining traction in the industry.  The textile industry is also embracing digital technologies like 3D knitting, digital printing, and computer-aided design (CAD) to streamline production processes, reduce waste, and create customizable fabrics with intricate designs. These technologies enable manufacturers to respond quickly to changing market demands and produce high-quality fabrics with greater efficiency.  Globalization has significantly impacted textile manufacturing, leading to the outsourcing of production to regions with lower labor costs and more lenient regulations. While this has increased efficiency and reduced costs for manufacturers, it has also raised concerns about ethical practices, worker conditions, and environmental standards in textile factories worldwide.  In conclusion, textiles and fabrics manufacturing processes are a blend of tradition, innovation, and sustainability. From selecting raw materials to weaving or knitting fabrics and applying finishing touches, each step contributes to the creation of diverse and functional textiles that enrich our lives. As consumer demand for sustainable and ethically produced textiles grows, the industry continues to evolve, adopting new technologies and practices to meet these changing expectations while maintaining a balance between creativity, efficiency, and environmental responsibility.""","880"
"Bent Arthur Cleveland","""One dragon-fly, one bumblebee, and one 'walking stick' were also included in the contents.' Professor the worm-eating warbler among the birds seen catching locusts in Nebraska. Behavior.-- the best account of the activities of the worm-eating warbler as follows: They keep much on the ground, where they walk about rather slowly, searching for their food among the dried leaves. In general appearance they are quite unique, and I rarely failed to identify one with an instant's glance, so very peculiar are all their attitudes and motions. The tail is habitually carried at an elevation considerably above the line of the back, which gives them a smart, jaunty air, and if the dorsal aspect be exposed, in a clear light, the peculiar marking of the crown is quite conspicuous. Seen as they usually are, however, dimly flitting ahead through the gloom and shadow of the thickets, the impression received is that of a dark little bird which vanishes unaccountably before your very eyes, leaving you quite uncertain where to look for it next; indeed, I hardly know a more difficult bird to procure, for the slightest noise sends it darting off through the woods at once. Occasionally you will come upon one winding around the trunk of some small tree exactly in the manner of Mniotilta varia, moving out along the branches with nimble motion, peering alternately under the bark on either side, and anon returning to the main stem, perhaps in the next instant to hop back to the ground again. On such occasions they rarely ascend to the height of more than eight or ten feet. The males are very quarrelsome, chasing one another through the woods with loud, sharp chirpings, careering with almost inconceivable velocity up among the tops of the highest oaks, or darting among the thickets with interminable doublings until the pursuer, growing tired of the chase, alights on some low twig or old mossy log, and in token of his victory, utters a warble so feeble that you must be very near to catch it at all, a sound like that produced by striking two pebbles very quickly and gently together, or the song of Spizella socialis heard at a distance, and altogether a very indifferent performance. Voice.--Aretas A. Saunders has contributed the following study of the song of this warbler: The song of the worm-eating warbler is a simple trill, varying from - to - seconds in length. It is usually all on the same pitch, but a few songs rise or fall a half tone, and one record I have rises a full tone and then drops a half tone at the end. The quality is not musical, but rather closely resembles some forms of the chipping sparrow's song. The pitch varies from G sharp to F sharp, one tone less than an octave. The majority of songs are a continuous trill, that is, the notes are too fast to be separated and counted by ear. I have three examples that are broken into short, very rapid notes. Two of these were of 8 notes and one was of 8. Most of the songs vary in loudness, becoming loudest in the middle, or beginning loud and fading away toward the end. One record becomes louder toward the end and ends abruptly. Francis H. Allen describes in his notes a song 'remarkably like that of the chipping sparrow, but more rapid than is usual with that species, I think, and perhaps shorter, though not so short as the chippy's early-morning song. The bill quivers with the song, but does not close between the chips. The bird sang constantly as it flitted about, usually 0 or 0 feet from the ground, seeming to prefer dead branches and twigs.' Almost everyone emphasizes the resemblance of the song to that of the chipping sparrow. Burns says: 'I can distinguish no difference between the notes of this species and the Chipping Sparrow; the first may be a trifle weaker perhaps.' But, in some notes recently sent to me, he writes: 'The song has often been described as easily mistaken for that of either the chipping sparrow or slate-colored junco, but by no means by an expert. The notes of the worm-eater have a buzzing or bubbling quality not easily described, but are quite distinct from the flat notes of the species named above.' And Eugene P.: 'The songs of no other three birds known to me are more alike than those of the Worm-eating Warbler, the Chipping Sparrow, and the Slate-colored Snowbird.' He is in agreement with Saunders and Burns that this bird sings from the time of its arrival until the last of June or early July, but he also says: 'On July 0, 881, several of these birds were silently inhabiting a small tract of woodland, their first season of song having passed; here, on August 4, and again on the 1st, they were found in fine plumage and in full song.' Evidently there is a cessation of singing during the molting period. Burns says of the song: 'The series of notes may be uttered while perched, or creeping about the lower branches of the trees, sapling tops, bushes or fallen brush, or while on the ground. With slightly drooping tail and wings, puffing out of body plumage, throwing its head back until the beak is perpendicular, it trills with swelling throat an unvarying Che-e-e-e-e-e-e, which does not sound half so monotonous in the woods as does the Chippy's lay in the open.' Dr. Chapman adds: 'Mr. W. DeW. Miller of Plainfield, New Jersey, tells me that he has on two occasions heard a flight song from this species. It is described by him as much more varied and musical than the ordinary song, though lacking in strength. It was given as the bird flew through the woods at an even level, not rising above the tree-tops, as does the Oven-bird and other flight singers.' Field marks.--When seen walking around on the ground the worm-eating warbler might be mistaken for an ovenbird, but the conspicuous black stripes on the head of the former are quite distinctive, very different from the head markings of the latter. Moreover, the ovenbird is distinctly spotted on the breast, whereas the warbler has a plain, unmarked breast and no conspicuous wing bars. Except for the bold stripes on the head it is just a plain olive and buffy warbler in all plumages. Enemies.--Says Burns: 'This Warbler's enemies are wood-mice, red squirrels and hunting dogs; the latter will sometimes push up and overturn the nest; an occasional weasel or blacksnake may destroy a few young. The percentage of loss while in the nest cannot be high.' Friedmann regards the worm-eating warbler as a 'rather uncommonly imposed upon species' by the eastern cowbird. 'Twenty-one definite records, and as many more indefinite ones have come to my notice.' Winter.--Dr. Alexander F. Skutch contributes the following: 'Widely distributed as a winter resident in Central America, the worm-eating warbler appears to be everywhere very rare. It occurs from Guatemala to Panama on both coasts, and upward in the mountains to at least,00 feet. On February 6, 935/8, I found one in the forest on Barro Colorado Island, Canal Zone, which appears to represent a slight southward extension of the known range. I have recorded this rare visitant from every part of Central America below,00 feet in which I have made an extended sojourn during the months of the northern winter, yet only one or two in each locality, except on the Finca Moca on the Pacific slope of Guatemala at,00 feet above sea-level, where in one day--January 1, 935/8--I saw three. The worm-eating warbler is found in the Tropics beneath dense thickets or in the undergrowth of the forest, usually near the ground; but at times one will rise to the lower branches of the trees to investigate curled dead leaves caught up among them. It is solitary rather than social in its habits. 'The records of the occurrence of this warbler in Central America are too few to indicate clearly the dates of its arrival and departure. I found one at Tela, Honduras, on August 9, 930; but the next early record is for October 4, at the same locality. Griscom quotes a record by Dearborn for the occurrence of this warbler at Patulul, Guatemala, on April; but except for this, the latest record I have seen is from El General, Costa Rica, March 1, 939.' Range.--Eastern United States to Panama. Breeding range.--The worm-eating warbler breeds =north= to northeastern Kansas (Lawrence); possibly central southern Nebraska (Red Cloud); probably south-central Iowa (Des Moines); probably southern Wisconsin (Wyalusing, Madison, and Milwaukee); northeastern Illinois (Hinsdale); southern Indiana (Terre Haute, Bloomington, and Indianapolis); central Ohio (Columbus, East Liverpool, and possibly Cleveland); southern New York (Penn Yan and Albany), and southern Connecticut (New Haven and Saybrook). It has been found in summer north to London, Ontario; Northampton, Ipswich, and North Eastham, Massachusetts. =East= to Connecticut (Saybrook); Long Island (Newtown); northern New Jersey (Elizabeth and Morristown); eastern Pennsylvania (Norristown and Philadelphia); northern Delaware (Wilmington); central Maryland (Baltimore; rarely east of Chesapeake Bay); eastern Virginia (Cobham and Dismal Swamp); central North Carolina (Chapel Hill and Statesville); northwestern South Carolina (Caesars Head, Mount Pinnacle, and Sassafras Mountain); and northern Georgia (Brasstown Bald and Atlanta). =South= to northern Georgia (Atlanta); central Tennessee (Nashville and Wildersville); northern Arkansas (Newport and Winslow); and, occasionally, extreme northern Texas (Bowie County and Gainesville). =West= to northern Texas (Gainesville); northeastern Oklahoma (Jay); and eastern Kansas (Lawrence). It has been recorded in summer, but with no evidence of breeding, at Red Cloud, Nebr., and at London and Vineland Station, Ontario.""","""Worm-eating Warbler Behavior and Characteristics""","2170","""The Worm-eating Warbler, scientifically known as Helmitheros vermivorum, is a small songbird that belongs to the group of New World warblers. This fascinating bird species is primarily found in the eastern parts of North America, especially in the deciduous forests of the United States, where it thrives in the dense undergrowth of wooded areas. Renowned for its distinctive behavior and characteristics, the Worm-eating Warbler offers a unique glimpse into the intricacies of avian life.  One of the key features that distinguish the Worm-eating Warbler is its olive-green upperparts and pale yellow underparts, with faint dark streaks on its sides. Its buff-colored crown and distinctive eye-ring give this bird a subtle yet elegant appearance. Despite its unassuming plumage, the Worm-eating Warbler has a charm that captivates birdwatchers and wildlife enthusiasts alike.  In terms of behavior, the Worm-eating Warbler exhibits interesting traits that set it apart from other avian species. This warbler is known for its ground-foraging habits, where it searches for insects, spiders, and, as the name suggests, worms in the leaf litter and debris on the forest floor. Unlike many other warblers that predominantly feed in the treetops, the Worm-eating Warbler's feeding strategy involves scouring the underbrush with meticulous precision, using its slender bill to probe and extract its prey from the forest floor.  During the breeding season, male Worm-eating Warblers can be observed engaging in elaborate courtship displays to attract potential mates. These displays often involve fluttering flights, accompanied by melodious songs that echo through the dense foliage of their wooded habitat. Once a pair forms, they work together to build a cup-shaped nest using grass, leaves, and bark strips, usually situated close to the ground amidst shrubs or saplings.  The Worm-eating Warbler is a migratory bird, embarking on a lengthy journey from its breeding grounds in the eastern United States to its wintering grounds in Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. This migration, which spans thousands of miles, is a remarkable feat of endurance and navigational skill that showcases the resilience of this small but mighty bird.  Despite its relatively small size, the Worm-eating Warbler plays a crucial role in its ecosystem. By preying on insects and other invertebrates, it helps regulate insect populations, thereby contributing to the overall balance of the forest ecosystem. Additionally, as a source of food for predators such as snakes, mammals, and birds of prey, the Worm-eating Warbler forms an essential component of the food web in its habitat.  Conservation efforts are critical for the continued survival of the Worm-eating Warbler, as habitat loss and fragmentation pose significant threats to this species. Preservation of the deciduous forests that serve as its breeding grounds is essential to ensure the long-term viability of populations across its range. Furthermore, initiatives aimed at raising awareness about the importance of protecting this unique bird and its habitat are vital for fostering a culture of conservation among local communities and conservation organizations.  In conclusion, the Worm-eating Warbler stands out as a remarkable avian species with its distinctive behavior and characteristics. From its ground-foraging feeding habits to its migratory journeys across continents, this small songbird exemplifies the resilience and adaptability of wildlife in the face of environmental challenges. By appreciating and safeguarding the habitat of the Worm-eating Warbler, we can contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and the intricate web of life that sustains our natural world.""","719"
"McCarty Louis Philippe","""When tobacco is burned a new set of substances is produced, some of which are less harmful than the nicotine, and are more agreeable in effect, and much of the acrid oil--a substance quite as irritating and poisonous as nicotine--is carried off. These fire-produced substances are called, from their origin, the 'pyridine series.' By great heat the more aromatic and less-harmful members of the series are produced, but the more poisonous compounds are generated by the slow combustion of damp tobacco. This oil which is liberated by combustion is bad both in flavor and in effect, and it is better, even for the immediate pleasure of the smoker, that it should be excluded altogether from his mouth and air passages. 'Smoking in a stub of a pipe is particularly injurious, for the reason that in it the oil is stored in a condensed form, and the smoke is therefore highly charged with the oil. Sucking or chewing the stub of a cigar that one is smoking is a serious mistake, because the nicotine in the unburned tobacco dissolves freely in the saliva, and is absorbed. 'Chewing' is, on this account, the most injurious form of the tobacco habit, and the use of a cigar holder is an improvement on the custom of holding the cigar between the teeth. Cigarettes are responsible for a great amount of mischief, not because the smoke from the paper has any particularly evil effect, but because smokers--and they are often boys or very young men--are apt to use them continuously, or at frequent intervals, believing that their power for evil is insignificant. Thus the nerves are under the constant influence of the drug, and much injury to the system results. Moreover, the cigarette smoker uses a very considerable amount of tobacco during the course of a day. 'Dipping' and 'snuffing' are semi-barbarities which need not be discussed. Not much effect is obtained from the use of the drug in these varieties of the habit. 'Nicotine is one of the most powerful of the 'nerve poisons' known. Its virulence is compared to that of prussic acid. If birds be made to inhale its vapor in amounts too small to be measured, they are almost instantly killed. It seems to destroy life, not by attacking a few, but of all the functions essential to it, beginning at the center, the heart. A significant indication of this is that there is no substance known which can counteract its effects; the system either succumbs or survives. Its depressing action on the heart is by far the most noticeable and noteworthy symptom of nicotine poisoning. The frequent existence of what is known 'tobacco heart' in men whose health is in no other respect disturbed is due to this fact.' 'A youth of eighteen at Bayshire, L. I., has become insane from the excessive use of cigarettes.' Those who can use tobacco without immediate injury will have all the pleasant effects reversed and will suffer from the symptoms of poisoning if they exceed the limits of tolerance. These symptoms are:. The heart's action becomes more rapid when tobacco is used.. Palpitation, pain, or unusual sensations in the heart.. There is no appetite in the morning, the tongue is coated, delicate flavors are not appreciated, and acid dyspepsia occurs after eating.. Soreness of the mouth and throat, or nasal catarrh appears, and becomes very troublesome.. The eyesight becomes poor, but improves when the habit is abandoned.. A desire, often a craving, for liquor or some other stimulant is experienced. 'In an experimental observation of thirty-eight boys of all classes of society, and of average health, who had been using tobacco for periods ranging from two months to two years, twenty-seven showed severe injury to the constitution and insufficient growth; thirty-two showed the existence of irregularity of the heart's action, disordered stomachs, cough, and a craving for alcohol; thirteen had intermittency of the pulse, and one had consumption. After they had abandoned the use of tobacco, within six months one-half were free from all their former symptoms, and the remainder had recovered by the end of the year.' Pasteur Recommends Camphor Smoking.--In an interview with M. Pasteur, he was asked whether he considered la grippe occasioned by bacteria? The professor smiled sardonically and shrugged his shoulders, but said nothing. On being asked what he considered the best remedy for the malady, he remarked: 'Let men and women both quit smoking tobacco and smoke camphor instead, and they will probably escape the pest.'--Paris Special. The Bulletin of this city has a good article on insanity and the cigarette. Ten or twelve boys have within a short time been committed to the insane asylum at Napa whose insanity has been traced directly to the smoking of cigarettes. The number who by reason of the same indulgence have brought on a degree of imbecility that may ultimately land them in the asylum or in the penitentiary cannot be reduced to an exact estimate. But having occasion recently to make some inquiry about a number of boys who had figured in the records of the criminal courts, it was found that a majority of them were habitual smokers of cigarettes. The connection between cigarette smoking, mental imbecility, idiocy, and crime has recently attracted more than usual attention. No boy or young man can smoke a cigarette without being harmed thereby. One of the reasons ascribed for the lunacy of several boys was that the cigarettes were made up of the vilest stuff. They contained a narcotic beyond that usually found in pure tobacco. This is supposed to be some of the cheaper forms of opium. But, whatever it may be, it is making imbeciles and idiots of many boys, and criminals of some of them. In a number of instances where boys have been sent to the asylum, it was found that after a short period, the cigarette and all other forms of dissipation having been cut off, the patients rapidly improved, and after a few months' detention they were sent home. The evil does not end here. If a boy becomes an inveterate cigarette smoker, the chances are greatly against any reformation. Some friend may take him in hand and show him the danger in season. The larger number will keep right on. Of this number it is doubtful if ten per cent will ever come to anything. And even these will accomplish far less than if they had never weakened their mental powers by this vile indulgence. The crazy boys who bring up in the asylum are only the few wretched examples of the cigarette mania. Other examples are constantly found in the criminal courts. The moral sense has been utterly lost, or so weakened that there is no clear distinction between right and wrong. Every boy who smokes a cigarette has started to go to the bad. Just where he will bring up--whether in the insane asylum, in the criminal courts, or in a condition of such hopeless moral and mental imbecility that friends must support him, or the almshouse must finally give him shelter, is one of the questions that time will settle for him. But if any better record is to be made for him, the boy and the cigarette must have a prompt and final separation. The Boston Herald states: 'It is said that Turkish tobacco contains prussic acid, and that Havana tobacco has another alkalide called collidine, of which one-twentieth of a drop will kill a frog, with symptoms of paralysis. The half-liquid matter that accumulates in the bowl of a pipe will kill a small animal in three-drop doses. A few drops of nicotine inserted under the conjunctiva of an animal will kill at once. Eight drops will kill a horse, with frightful general convulsions. It has been observed that the living systems quickly become tolerant of tobacco poison--'an animal that is thrown into convulsions by half a drop one day will require twice as much the next day, and so in four or five days four or five times as much.' The following is suggestive: No student who smokes can obtain a scholarship at Dartmouth College, Hanover, N. H. It is a new rule of the faculty. As the purchase of the breweries of the United States has been commenced by the capitalists of the eastern continent, I trust they will extend their purchases to the distilleries and tobacco warehouses and plantations on this continent, especially of the United States; its financiers being shrewd will the sooner observe the advancement of intelligent progress in the line of thought, and change their investments from breweries, distilleries, and cigarette and tobacco manufactories, to the sinking of artesian wells and the invention of some improved water-filter. =Tonsillitis, Quinsy,= Black Tongue, or Ulcerated Sore Throat.--.

Despite increased awareness of the dangers associated with smoking and tobacco products, millions of people worldwide continue to use tobacco in various forms. Understanding the dangers of tobacco use is crucial in combating this global health issue and promoting a smoke-free environment. From the health risks to the economic burden and environmental implications, the negative consequences of tobacco use are far-reaching and multifaceted.  One of the most well-known dangers of tobacco use is its severe impact on individual health. Smoking tobacco is a leading cause of preventable diseases and premature deaths globally. The primary health risks associated with tobacco use include an increased risk of developing various cancers, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, and other health conditions like stroke and diabetes. Nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco, is known to have harmful effects on the brain and can lead to substance dependence, making it difficult for individuals to quit smoking once they are addicted.  Furthermore, exposure to secondhand smoke, also known as passive smoking, poses significant health risks to non-smokers, including children, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. Secondhand smoke contains many of the same toxic chemicals found in firsthand smoke and can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and lung cancer in non-smokers who are regularly exposed to it. Protecting non-smokers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke is essential in creating a safe and healthy environment for all individuals.  In addition to the direct health consequences, tobacco use also exerts a substantial economic burden on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. The costs associated with treating tobacco-related diseases place a significant strain on healthcare resources and contribute to escalating healthcare expenditures. Smoking-related illnesses not only lead to increased medical costs but also result in lost productivity due to absenteeism, disability, and premature death. The economic impact of tobacco extends beyond healthcare expenses to include expenses related to fire damage, litter cleanup, and loss of resources due to tobacco farming and production.  Moreover, tobacco cultivation and production have negative environmental implications that further highlight the dangers of tobacco use. The process of growing tobacco crops requires the extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers, contributing to soil degradation, water pollution, and deforestation. Tobacco farming also leads to the depletion of natural resources and the release of greenhouse gases, exacerbating environmental degradation and climate change. The manufacturing and packaging of tobacco products generate substantial waste and pollution, further adding to the environmental footprint of tobacco use.  Addressing the dangers of tobacco use requires a comprehensive approach that involves multiple stakeholders, including governments, healthcare providers, public health organizations, and the community. Implementing evidence-based tobacco control policies, such as tobacco taxes, smoke-free laws, advertising restrictions, and access to smoking cessation resources, is crucial in reducing tobacco consumption and preventing the associated health risks. Public health campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the dangers of tobacco use and promoting smoking cessation programs can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.  On an individual level, quitting tobacco use is one of the most effective ways to protect personal health and reduce the risks associated with smoking. Seeking support from healthcare professionals, joining smoking cessation programs, using nicotine replacement therapies, and adopting healthy lifestyle habits can increase the chances of successfully quitting smoking. Encouraging family and friends to quit smoking and creating smoke-free environments in homes and workplaces can also contribute to reducing overall tobacco consumption and minimizing exposure to secondhand smoke.  Furthermore, promoting tobacco control measures and advocating for tobacco-free policies at the community and societal levels can create a supportive environment that encourages smoking cessation and discourages tobacco use. Engaging in advocacy efforts to raise awareness about the dangers of tobacco use, participating in tobacco control initiatives, and supporting public health campaigns can help drive positive change and contribute to the overall goal of achieving a tobacco-free society.  In conclusion, the dangers of tobacco use extend far beyond individual health risks to encompass economic, environmental, and societal implications. Understanding the multifaceted impact of tobacco use is essential in addressing this global public health challenge effectively. By raising awareness, implementing evidence-based tobacco control policies, supporting smoking cessation efforts, and fostering tobacco-free environments, we can work towards reducing tobacco consumption, preventing tobacco-related diseases, and promoting the health and well-being of individuals and communities worldwide. Together, we can strive towards a future free from the dangers of tobacco use and create a healthier and more sustainable world for all.""","904"
"Schlegel Friedrich von","""It was by such conduct, and the influence which he thereby acquired, as well as by the sanction of the civil power, that the Reformation was promoted and consolidated. Without this, Protestantism would have sunk into the lawless anarchy which marked the proceedings of the Hussites, and to which the war of the peasants rapidly tended; and it would inevitably have been suppressed, like all the earlier popular commotions--for under the latter form, Protestantism may be said to have sprung up several centuries before. And besides, none of the other heads and leaders of the new religious party had the power, or were in a situation to uphold the Protestant religion--its present existence is solely and entirely the work and the deed of one man, unique in his way, and who holds unquestionably a conspicuous place in the history of the world. Much was staked on the soul of that man, and this was in every respect a mighty and critical moment in the annals of mankind, and the march of time. The real problem for the age would have been to terminate this unhappy confusion of doctrines, that is to say, that disorder and not unfrequent confusion in the relations of the ecclesiastical and civil powers, (occasioned by the general state of things in Europe, and by the circumstances which first promoted the political and intellectual civilization of the West)--in a word, to compose the old dispute between church and state, and bring it to a just Christian settlement by a peaceful and amicable arrangement. Then the many existing, though scattered, rays of true Christian piety, humility, and self-denial, as well as the new discoveries in science would have acquired a more intense and more extended power--an event which was now entirely prevented by a great civil war between two religious parties, and was not brought to a full accomplishment till a much later period. But the total rejection of the traditions of the hostility of the German Reformers to the church was of a different and more spiritual nature; and it was the religious dignity of the priesthood which was more especially the object of their destructive efforts. And this is the point, where doctrinal controversy enters within the province of history; for the priesthood stands or falls with faith in the sacred mysteries. The rejection of these mysteries, by one half of the Protestant body in Switzerland, France, England, and the Netherlands, Luther not only discountenanced, but strenuously reprobated; yet it was only by a subtle distinction he attempted to separate those mysteries from the functions of the priesthood; and it was not difficult to foresee that together with faith in the sacred mysteries, respect for the clergy must sooner or later be destroyed, as indeed experience has sufficiently demonstrated. For that great mystery of religion, on which the whole dignity of the Christian priesthood depends, forms the simple, but very deep internal keystone of all Christian doctrines; and thus the rejection, or even the infringement of this dogma, shakes the foundations of religion, and leads to its total overthrow. The pacific conferences of learned and well-meaning men of both parties, though often renewed, were not attended with real and ultimate success; although sometimes, in looking at the language of such a man as the mild Melancthon, we are almost perplexed to discover the few points which do not coincide with the old Catholic doctrines--so nearly akin, and almost identical do the two religious systems appear, when we merely consider their separate parts. Equally fruitless were all those honest attempts at pacification, incessantly made by the Emperor Charles, who sought by his interim to create delay, while he indulged a secret hope, that the agitated waves of anarchy,--all that mighty tempest of opinion, would be allayed by time, and would finally be stilled. But that interim has been of longer duration than was at first calculated, and it still awaits the judgment of God for its great day of termination. When we consider Luther's original powers of mind, independently of the use and employment which he made of those extraordinary powers, (for even the greatest comet, though it should cover half the heavens with the splendour of its light, can never possess, or be supposed to possess, the sun's genial warmth;)--when I say, we consider the intellectual endowments of this extraordinary man solely in themselves; the boldness of his speculations and the vigour of his eloquence will be found to form an epoch, not the history of the German language, but in the progress of European science and European culture. After the first period in the intellectual history of Europe, which I denominated the scholastico-romantic epoch, and after the second, which I termed the epoch of enthusiasm for Pagan Antiquity, and in which a Christian simplicity of eloquence and a depth of scientific enquiry appear as only happy and occasional exceptions; a third epoch now arose, which from the general spirit of the age, and the tone of the writings, which exerted a commanding influence over the times, cannot be otherwise designated than as the era of a polemico-barbarous eloquence. This rude polemic spirit which had its origin in the Reformation, and in that concussion of faith, and consequently of all thought and all science which Protestantism occasioned, continued, down to the end of the seventeenth century, to prevail in the controversial writings and philosophic speculations both of Germany and England. This spirit was not incompatible with a sort of deep mystical sensibility, and a certain original boldness of thought and expression, such, for instance, as Luther's writings display; yet we cannot at all regard in a favourable light the general spirit of that intellectual epoch, or consider it as one by any means adapted to the intellectual exigencies of that age. But with respect to the language and literature of Germany, so far as these are of general interest, I should wish to make one observation.""","""Protestant Reformation and its impact""","1203","""The Protestant Reformation was a pivotal movement in the 16th century that forever changed the course of Western Christianity. This religious revolution, sparked by Martin Luther in 1517, challenged the authority of the Roman Catholic Church and led to the establishment of new Christian denominations. The Reformation was a response to widespread corruption and abuses within the Catholic Church, including indulgences, the selling of forgiveness for sins, and the concentration of power in the hands of the clergy.  Martin Luther, a German monk and theologian, played a central role in the Reformation. His famous 95 Theses, nailed to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, criticized the Church's practices and called for reform. Luther's ideas spread rapidly due to the recent invention of the printing press, which allowed for the mass production of pamphlets and books. This dissemination of information was crucial in reaching a broader audience and fostering support for the Reformation.  One of the key principles of the Reformation was sola scriptura, the belief that the Bible alone is the ultimate authority in matters of faith and doctrine. This emphasis on scripture led to a reevaluation of traditional Catholic teachings and practices. Luther and other reformers, such as John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli, sought to return to the early Christian teachings found in the Bible and rejected certain Catholic doctrines, such as the veneration of saints and the authority of the Pope.  The Reformation also brought about changes in the understanding of salvation. Luther emphasized the concept of justification by faith alone, affirming that individuals are saved through their faith in God's grace rather than through good works or indulgences. This new understanding of salvation had profound implications for how people viewed their relationship with God and the Church.  As the Reformation gained momentum, it led to the fragmentation of Western Christianity. New Protestant denominations emerged, each with its own interpretation of scripture and theology. The Lutheran Church, founded by Luther, became one of the first Protestant churches. Calvinism, influenced by the teachings of John Calvin, spread throughout Europe and beyond. Other Protestant groups, such as the Anabaptists and Anglicans, also formed in response to the Reformation.  The impact of the Protestant Reformation was far-reaching and multifaceted. In addition to its religious significance, the Reformation had profound social, political, and cultural implications. The rise of Protestantism challenged the traditional authority structures of Europe, leading to conflicts between Catholic and Protestant powers. The Thirty Years' War, fought from 1618 to 1648, was a devastating conflict that pitted Catholic and Protestant states against each other and resulted in widespread destruction and loss of life.  The Reformation also contributed to the emergence of new forms of governance and individual freedom. The idea of religious tolerance began to take root, as different Protestant groups sought the freedom to worship according to their beliefs. This desire for religious liberty paved the way for the broader concepts of freedom of conscience and separation of church and state, principles that would later influence the development of modern democracies.  Culturally, the Reformation had a lasting impact on art, literature, and education. Protestantism's emphasis on literacy and the accessibility of scripture to all believers led to an expansion of education and the proliferation of vernacular languages. Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and writers like John Milton drew inspiration from the Reformation and its themes of faith, individualism, and moral responsibility.  In conclusion, the Protestant Reformation was a transformative movement that reshaped the religious and cultural landscape of Europe and beyond. Its influence continues to be felt today in the diversity of Christian denominations, the principles of religious freedom, and the ongoing dialogue between different branches of Christianity. The Reformation remains a powerful reminder of the capacity for individuals to challenge established norms, seek reform, and strive for a more just and equitable society.""","783"
"Fisher Joseph F R H S ","""Their land was held by permission of the conquerors. The wall erected at so much labor in the north of England proved a less effectual barrier against the incursions of the Picts and Scots than the living barrier of armed men which, at a later period, successfully repelled their invasions. The Roman rule affords another example that material prosperity cannot secure the liberties of a people, that they must be armed and prepared to repel by force any aggression upon their liberty or their estates. 'Who will be free, themselves must strike the blow.' The prosperous 'Britons,' who were left by the Romans in possession of the island, were but feeble representatives of those who, under Caractacus and Boadicea, did not shrink from combat with the legions of Caesar. Uninured to arms, and accustomed to obedience, they looked for a fresh master, and sunk into servitude and serfdom, from which they never emerged. Yet under the Romans they had thriven and increased in material wealth; the island abounded in numerous flocks and herds; and agriculture, which was encouraged by the Romans, flourished. This wealth was by one of the temptations to the invaders, who seized not only upon the movable wealth of the natives, but also upon the land, and divided it among themselves. The warlike portion of the aboriginal inhabitants appear to have joined the Cymri and retired westward. Their system of landholding was non-feudal, inasmuch as each man's land was divided among all his sons. One of the laws of Hoel Dha, King of Wales in the tenth century, decreed 'that the youngest son shall have an equal share of the estate with the eldest son, and that when the brothers have divided their father's estate among them, the youngest son shall have the best house with all the office houses; the implements of husbandry, his father's kettle, his axe for cutting wood, and his knife; these three last things the father cannot give away by gift, nor leave by his last will to any but his youngest son, and if they are pledged they shall be redeemed.' It may not be out of place here to say that this custom continued to exist in Wales; and on its conquest Edward I. ordained, 'Whereas the custom is otherwise in Wales than England concerning succession to an inheritance, inasmuch as the inheritance is partible among the heirs-male, and from time whereof the memory of man is not to the contrary hath been partible, Our Lord the King will not have such custom abrogated, but willeth that inheritance shall remain partible among like heirs as it was wont to be, with this exception that bastards shall from henceforth not inherit, and also have portions with the lawful heirs; and if it shall happen that any inheritance should hereafter, upon failure of heirs-male, descend to females, the lawful heirs of their ancestors last served thereof. We will, of our especial grace, that the same women shall have their portions thereof, although this be contrary to the custom of Wales before used.' The land system of Wales, so recognized and regulated by Edward I., remained unchanged until the reign of the first Tudor monarch. Its existence raises the presumption that the aboriginal system of landholding in England gave each son a share of his father's land, and if so, it did not correspond with the Germanic system described by Caesar, nor with the tribal system of the Celts in Ireland, nor with the feudal system subsequently introduced. The polity of the Romans, which endured in Gaul, Spain, and Italy, and tinged the laws and usages of these countries after they had been occupied by the Goths, totally disappeared in England; and even Christianity, which partially prevailed under the Romans, was submerged beneath the flood of invasion. Save the material evidence of the footprints of 'the masters of the world' in the Roman roads, Roman wall, and some other structures, there is no trace of the Romans in England. Their polity, laws, and language alike vanished, and did not reappear for centuries, when their laws and language were reimported. I should not be disposed to estimate the population of England and Wales, at the retirement of the Romans, at more than,00,00. They were like a flock of sheep without masters, and, deprived of the watch-dogs which over-awed and protected them, fell an easy prey to the invaders. III. THE. The Roman legions and the outlying semi-military settlements along the Rhine and the Danube, forming a cordon reaching from the German Ocean to the Black Sea, kept back the tide of barbarians, but the volume of force accumulated behind the barrier, and at length it poured in an overwhelming and destructive tide over the fair and fertile provinces whose weak and effeminate people offered but a feeble resistance to the robust armies of the north. The Romans, under the instruction of Caesar and Tacitus, had a faint idea of the usages of the people inhabiting the verge that lay around the Roman dominions, but they had no knowledge of the influences that prevailed in 'the womb of nations,' as Central Europe appeared to the Latins, who saw emerging therefrom hosts of warriors, bearing with them their wives, their children, and their portable effects, determined to win a settlement amid the fertile regions owned and improved by the Romans. These incursions were not colonization in the sense in which Rome understood it; they were the migrations of a people, and were as full, as complete, and as extensive as the Israelitish invasion of Canaan--they were more destructive of property, but less fatal to life. These migratory hosts left a desert behind them, and they either gained a settlement or perished. The Roman colonies preserved their connection with the parent stem, and invoked aid when in need; but the barbarian hosts had no home, no reserves. Other races, moving with similar intent, settled on the land they had vacated. These brought their own social arrangements, and it is very difficult to connect the land system established by the aborigines with the system which, after a lapse of some hundreds of years, was found to prevail in another tribe or nation which had occupied the region that had been vacated. Neither Caesar nor Tacitus gives us any idea of the habits or usages of the people who lived north of the Belgae. They had no notion of Scandinavia nor of Sclavonia. The Walhalla of the north, with its terrific deities, was unknown to them; and I am disposed to think that we shall look in vain among the customs of the Teutons for the basis from whence came the polity established in England by the invaders of the fifth century. The -SAXONs came from a region north of the Elbe, which we call Schleswig--Holstein. They were kindred to the Norwegians and the Danes, and of the family of the sea robbers; they were not Teutons, for the Teutons were not and are not sailors. The Belgae colonized part of the coast--i.e., the settlers maintained a connection with the mainland; but the Angles, the Saxons, and the Jutes did not colonize, they migrated; they left no trace of their occupancy in the lands they vacated. Each separate invasion was the settlement of a district; each leader aspired to sovereignty, and was supreme in his own domains; each claimed descent from Woden, and, like Romulus or Alexander, sought affinity with the gods. Each member of the Heptarchy was independent of, and owed no allegiance to, the other members; and marriage or conquest united them ultimately into one kingdom. The primary institutions were moulded by time and circumstance, and the state of things in the eleventh century was as different from that of the fifth as those of our own time differ from the rule of Richard II. Yet one was as much an outgrowth of its predecessor as the other. Attempts have been made, with considerable ingenuity, to connect races with each other by peculiar characteristics, but human society has the same necessities, and we find great similarity in various divisions of society. At all times, and in all nations, society resolved itself into the upper, middle, and lower classes. Rome had its Nobles, Plebeians, and Slaves; Germany its Edhilingi, Frilingi, and Lazzi; England its Eaorls, Thanes, and Ceorls. It would be equally cogent to argue that, because Rome had three classes and England had three classes, the latter was derived from the former, as to conclude that, because Germany had three classes, therefore English institutions were Teutonic. If the invasion of the fifth century were Teutonic we should look for similar nomenclature, but there is as great a dissimilarity between the English and German names of the classes as between the former and those of Rome. The Germanic MARK system has no counterpart in the land system introduced into England by the -SAXONs. If village communities existed in England, it must have been before the invasion of the Romans. The German system, as described by Caesar, was suited to nomads--to races on the wing, who gave to no individual possession for more than a year, that there might be no home ties. The mark system is of a later date, and was evidently the arrangement of other races who permanently settled themselves upon the lands vacated by the older nations. And I may suggest whether, as these lands were originally inhabited by the Celts, the conquerors did not adopt the system of the conquered. Even in the nomenclature of, introduced into England in the fifth century, we are driven back to Scandinavia for an explanation. The word as applied to land has a Norwegian origin, from which country came Rollo, the progenitor of William the Norman. 'The, right of Norway, and the, right of Finland, came from the words 'Odh,' which signifies, and 'all,' which means. A transposition of these syllables makes ALL ODH, or, which means absolute property.""","""Roman Influence on British Landholding""","2102","""The Roman influence on British landholding has left a lasting impact on the landscape and social structure of the country. When the Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD, they brought with them not just their military might but also their sophisticated system of land ownership and management. This system, rooted in Roman law and tradition, significantly shaped the way land was owned, distributed, and utilized in ancient Britain.   One of the most enduring legacies of Roman landholding practices in Britain is the concept of private land ownership. The Romans introduced the idea of individual landownership, which differed from the Celtic tribal system of communal land use. Under Roman rule, land was surveyed, mapped, and allocated to individual landowners who could buy, sell, and pass on their land through inheritance. This shift from communal to private ownership laid the foundation for the modern system of land ownership in Britain.  Roman landownership also introduced the notion of land as a commodity that could be bought, sold, and traded. This marked a departure from the earlier Celtic practice of land as a communal resource tied to kinship and social status. The Romans introduced the concept of land as a form of wealth and status, leading to the development of a complex system of land tenure that included various forms of land ownership such as freehold, leasehold, and tenancy.  The Roman system of land surveying and mapping, known as centuriation, also had a significant impact on British landholding. Centuriation involved dividing land into square units called centuriae, which were then further subdivided and allocated to individual landowners. This meticulous system of land surveying not only facilitated efficient land management and taxation but also influenced the layout of rural settlements and the pattern of land use in Britain.  Another important aspect of Roman landholding in Britain was the development of agricultural practices and infrastructure. The Romans introduced advanced farming techniques, such as crop rotation, irrigation systems, and the use of new tools and implements, which led to increased agricultural productivity and economic development. They also built roads, bridges, and aqueducts to facilitate communication, trade, and transportation of goods, further shaping the landscape and connectivity of Britain.  The introduction of Roman villas in Britain also transformed the rural landscape and landholding patterns. Villas were large country estates owned by wealthy landowners, which served as centers of agricultural production, administration, and social life. These villas, with their impressive architecture, mosaic floors, and central courtyards, reflected the wealth and status of their owners and became symbols of Roman influence in the British countryside.  Moreover, the Roman influence on British landholding extended to the legal framework governing land ownership and tenure. Roman law, particularly the principles of property rights and contracts, played a crucial role in shaping the legal foundations of landownership in Britain. The Roman legal system introduced concepts such as land titles, easements, and boundaries, which continue to influence modern land law in the country.  The legacy of Roman landholding practices in Britain can still be seen in the landscape, architecture, and land use patterns across the country. Many Roman villas, roads, and rural settlements have been excavated and preserved, providing valuable insights into the organization and management of land under Roman rule. The enduring influence of Roman landholding can also be observed in the persistence of private landownership, land tenure systems, and legal principles governing land in modern Britain.  In conclusion, the Roman influence on British landholding was profound and multifaceted, shaping the way land was owned, managed, and utilized in ancient Britain. The introduction of private land ownership, agricultural practices, infrastructure development, legal frameworks, and architectural styles left a lasting imprint on the British landscape and social structure. The legacy of Roman landholding practices continues to resonate in the landholding patterns and legal principles governing landownership in modern Britain, highlighting the enduring impact of Roman civilization on the evolution of British society.""","779"
"McDonald J Daley James Daley  1892 ","""Biology lends itself ideally to the problem method of teaching. By using some every day problem of the pupil, his interest is assured. Even a seemingly simple problem if skilfully directed, will ramify into several fields of biology before its solution is completed. And the number of practicable problems is almost limitless, but not all are equally good for the purpose, so the teacher must often tactfully modify the pupils choice. Original choices are likely to be too complex for the pupil to solve at his stage of progress, so must be simplified, without his feeling that he has been interfered with, without causing a wane in his interest. It is clear that the real problem in the problem-method is the teacher's. Practically, it is quite impossible to handle individual projects in large classes. In the writer's experience, he has had on the average 0 different pupils per day in four separate classes. It is clearly beyond the power of any teacher to direct simultaneously eighty different projects, and it would be a physical impossibility to furnish the necessary laboratory apparatus. So, for this reason the teacher may find it necessary to divide, as diplomatically as possible, the classes into congenial groups, each with its problem, so that the total number of problems will be so limited that each one may be given adequate attention. It seems that such must be the limitation of the problem-method under the conditions prevailing in the public schools today. The procedure in solving a problem will consist of these steps in the order named, ) understanding of the purpose, ) the procedure or method of attack, ) observation of results, ) and the use of these in making some generalizations or arriving at some conclusions. Then there must follow a testing of these generalizations or conclusions by further experimentation. Accuracy must be the keynote of all work, accuracy in recording experiments, accuracy in observation, accuracy in drawing, which serves as a shortcut method of description. Neatness is very desireable but should never supercede thinking and understanding. If the problem has stimulated some accurate logical thinking on the part of the pupil, then time spent on it has been well spent. If, besides, it has yielded some valuable useable information, the solving of the problem has been a marked success. The laboratory method has been such an emancipation from the textbook slavery that there is some tendency to elevate it to an end in itself, whereas it must serve only as a very valuable means to an end. 'The ideal laboratory is only a reasonably good substitute for the out-of-doors.' So far as preparation in the methods of science teaching is concerned, much good may be accomplished in teachers courses and in practice teaching. But it must necessarily be of a general nature, for the unique individual method, determined by the interaction of teacher and pupil and the reaction of both to subject matter can evolve only hand in hand with teaching experience. Before proceeding further it might be well, by way of summary, to remind ourselves that the minimum qualifications for a teacher of biology must include the following; a) a large fund of the most interesting and most valuable facts of biology, b) a full realization of the values and vital relations of biology to humanity, c) ability to develop a course meeting the unique needs of the community, d) familiarity with purchase and useability of laboratory equipment, e) knowledge of the history of science, f) spirit of and sympathy with research, g) a knowledge of physical science as related to biology, h) and knowledge of the laboratory method and its value in the promotion of accurate logical constructive thinking. FOR. What possibilities of making adequate preparation, are to be found in colleges and universities? And how much preparation is required by the Teacher's Recommendation or other standards of fitness? In search of the answers to our questions, we may study conditions at the University of California, for there is as good opportunity and standards are as high in this school as anywhere in the country. The quantity of preparation is fairly assured by the five-year requirement for the Teacher's Recommendation, but the quality of the preparation is not so certainly assured. With the possible exception of the Education Department, no department considers the training of teachers even nearly equal in importance to the production of specialists in the subject who shall devote their lives to research. The subject is regarded as an end in itself. If a person were directed to make preparation for the teaching of biology, he would be at a loss in searching for the Biology Department, or even a department that gave a good comprehensive course in biology. The subject as best taught in the secondary schools is subdivided into various components, each with its special aim. The prospective teacher has no carefully prepared course of study for his pursuit, as has the prospective doctor, engineer, or farmer. The state provides a specially adapted course of training for its veterinarians, those who care for its livestock. Why not a special course of high standard for those who plan to devote their lives to the direction of the formative years of its children? It is probably explained in large part by the failure to recognize teaching as a profession. The Schools of Education throughout the country have been insisting upon real professional training for teachers but other departments are deplorably slow in cooperating. In order to avoid becoming entangled in abstractions, we may choose a specific instance to show the difficulties in the way of securing the correct kind of preparation, even though the quantity is guaranteed. The Zoology the following requirements for the Teacher's Recommendation: General Zoology Invertebrate Zoology -- an advanced course which omits all consideration of insects, and all discussion of parasitic forms. Vertebrate Zoology -- mainly a course in comparative morphology, which gives no field knowledge of California vertebrates, the most essential thing for the high school teacher. and one subject from each of the following groups, Group I Comparative Anatomy. Cytology -- basic principles must be understood by the teacher but he should not have to spend one whole half year to acquire them. Embryology -- the above is also true for this course. Group II. Biology of Water Supplies -- this course is primarily for sanitary engineers. Protozoology -- All that is necessary of this could be incorporated in a general course. Parasitology -- essential for health instruction and for illustration of certain biological principles. Group III. Experimental Zoology } combination of these valuable. Animal Behavior } Heredity, Evolution, and Eugenics -- this course is very essential for any teacher. (Required in the fifth year, the Teachers' Course, some work in research, and practice teaching.) Taken as a whole, the chief criticism to be made is that the subject has been so subdivided to insure no overlapping of courses, that it becomes necessary to take every course in order to obtain a well rounded preparation in the field. This requires more time than any individual can devote to it, for he must also have preparation in Botany, Physiology, and Bacteriology and Hygiene, and in these departments the arrangement of courses is essentially the same. The general course in Zoology is inadequate, for it is planned for an introduction to the more advanced courses and is careful not to steal too much from their fund of interesting information. The aim is to lay a thorough foundation rather than to discuss the more interesting facts and general principles of biology, though I am glad to believe that the present trend is decidedly in this latter direction. Here we find adequate preparation for a teacher of Zoology, but in no secondary school of the state will a teacher be employed for Zoology alone. In high schools the biological science curriculum the first course must be Biology, and it must be all-inclusive, for it is all of the biological science that the majority of the pupils will take. It would be a great step in advance if every school required even that much for graduation. Of the courses in Invertebrate Zoology and Vertebrate Zoology, it can be safely said that they overlook the importance of field work. Boys and girls sometimes have a surprisingly large superficial knowledge of the plants and animals of their vicinity, and this knowledge is of the sort obtained through observation of their ways in nature, that is, it is a field knowledge. The teacher must be prepared to use this to the greatest possible extent, but how can this be expected if the teacher knows little if any more than the children about the habits of plants and animals. Such training would have to be obtained through some of the field work of the Museum of Vertebrate zoology. But no work in that department is required for the Teachers Recommendation. A knowledge, though not an intensive knowledge, of each of the subjects that make up the three groups included in the requirements is quite necessary but it is out of the question for a person to take them all unless he specialize in Zoology. Not all can be expected to major in Zoology, and those that do will find it necessary to omit much that is essential in the other departments of biological science. Each department should have a general course covering fully its field of work so that those majoring in some other department may in minimum time gain a fair knowledge of its field. It is very doubtful if such a course is given in any department at present.""","""Biology teaching methods and challenges""","1857","""Biology is a fascinating subject that delves into the intricate workings of life. Teaching this discipline requires a combination of innovative methods and a nuanced understanding of the challenges educators may encounter. By exploring effective teaching strategies and addressing common obstacles, educators can inspire students to explore the wonders of the natural world.  One of the fundamental aspects of teaching biology is creating a dynamic and engaging learning environment. Incorporating hands-on activities such as laboratory experiments, field trips, and interactive simulations can help students grasp complex biological concepts. These practical experiences not only enhance understanding but also cultivate a sense of curiosity and discovery among learners. For example, a laboratory experiment demonstrating the process of photosynthesis can provide students with a concrete understanding of this essential biological process.  In addition to hands-on activities, incorporating multimedia resources can help cater to diverse learning styles. Utilizing videos, animations, and virtual reality tools can enhance visual and auditory learners' comprehension of biological phenomena. Interactive online platforms and virtual laboratories offer students the opportunity to explore biological concepts in a simulated environment, reinforcing their understanding through active participation.  Furthermore, integrating real-world applications and case studies into the curriculum can demonstrate the relevance of biology in everyday life. By connecting biological principles to current events, environmental issues, and medical advancements, educators can help students appreciate the practical implications of their studies. For instance, examining the impact of climate change on biodiversity or exploring the role of genetics in personalized medicine can foster a deeper appreciation for the relevance of biology beyond the classroom.  Another effective teaching strategy in biology is promoting collaborative learning through group projects, discussions, and peer-to-peer teaching. By encouraging students to work together, share ideas, and explain concepts to their peers, educators can foster a sense of community and facilitate knowledge exchange. Collaborative activities not only enhance students' communication and teamwork skills but also reinforce their understanding of biological concepts through peer interaction.  Despite the benefits of these teaching methods, biology educators may encounter various challenges in the classroom. One common obstacle is the vast amount of content that needs to be covered within a limited timeframe. The sheer breadth of biological topics, from cellular biology to ecology, can be overwhelming for both educators and students. To address this challenge, prioritizing key concepts, focusing on overarching themes, and integrating interdisciplinary connections can help streamline the curriculum without sacrificing depth of understanding.  Another challenge in biology education is the need to adapt to advances in technology and scientific research. As new discoveries continually reshape our understanding of the natural world, educators must stay abreast of these developments to provide students with up-to-date information. Integrating cutting-edge research findings, incorporating bioinformatics tools, and leveraging online resources can help educators bridge the gap between traditional textbook knowledge and the latest scientific insights.  Additionally, addressing diverse student backgrounds, learning preferences, and abilities poses a significant challenge in biology education. Educators must employ inclusive teaching practices that cater to students with varying levels of prior knowledge and different learning styles. Providing differentiated instruction, offering personalized support, and fostering a culture of inclusivity are crucial in ensuring that all students have the opportunity to succeed in biology.  Moreover, assessment in biology presents its own set of challenges, particularly in evaluating complex biological processes and critical thinking skills. Traditional multiple-choice exams may not adequately measure students' ability to apply biological concepts to real-world scenarios or analyze experimental data. Incorporating performance-based assessments, such as lab reports, research projects, and presentations, can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of students' understanding and skills.  In conclusion, effective biology teaching involves a combination of innovative strategies, practical experiences, and adaptive approaches to address the diverse needs of students. By creating an engaging learning environment, integrating multimedia resources, promoting collaborative learning, and staying current with scientific advancements, educators can inspire students to explore the wonders of biology. Despite the challenges posed by the vast content coverage, evolving technology, student diversity, and assessment complexity, dedicated educators can overcome these obstacles through thoughtful planning, flexibility, and a commitment to student success in the study of life sciences.""","790"
"Honea Kenneth","""It is conceivable that some of these formations may have accumulated during the Late Pleistocene. In view of all factors, dating of Blanco points relative to other Early Man points must await future excavations. I This projectile point type was named after the type site, Sandia Cave, situated at the north end of the Sandia Mountains near Albuquerque, New Mexico. Such points have also been found at the Lucy Site in Central New Mexico, in Central Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa, and possibly Alabama, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Sandia I points are lanceolate in shape and may be somewhat asymmetrical in outline. They are distinctive in having a single shoulder on one side of the stem. Gently rounded lateral edges on the upper portion taper to a point, while the rounded stem edges taper to the somewhat narrow, rounded base. Specimens are broadest somewhat below mid-section and have a lenticular cross section at this point. Both the stem and the base have been smoothed by grinding. Total length may vary from about. to. cm., and width from. to. cm. Manufacture was evidently by direct percussion and not as refined as on some later Early Man Points. Initial flake scars on point faces are irregular; point bases have been thinned by multi-directional flaking. Pressure retouch is absent. Sandia I projectile points are accepted by most archaeologists as among the oldest documented, though not reliably dated, point types of the Southwest and North America in general. Similarly, the relationship of Sandia points to Clovis and other Early Man point types has not yet been clearly established. That Sandia points are older than Folsom points does remain certain, however. They may also be older than Clovis points. II Sandia II points were discovered together with Sandia I points at Sandia Cave near Albuquerque, New Mexico. They differ from Sandia I points in a number of respects. Single-shouldered Sandia II points are quite similar to those of the type Sandia I excepting details on the stem, base shape and certain aspects of workmanship. Instead of tapering to a rounded base, the straight-edged stem of Sandia II points contracts to a straight or slightly concave base. Workmanship is generally finer than in the other type, though achieved by the same means. Resolved secondary edge thinning is noticeable on many specimens. Sandia II points are also marked by vertical basal thinning, produced by the removal of a large, or several smaller longish flakes parallel to the point long-axis, anticipating perhaps the fluting found on Clovis and Folsom points. Vertical basal thinning is absent on points of the Sandia I type. III Sandia III points were discovered in 95/84 together with Sandia I, Sandia II, and other Early Man points in a series of blow-outs near Lucy, central New Mexico. Single-shouldered Sandia III points are similar in all respects to Sandia II points with these exceptions: the base on specimens of the Sandia III type is consistently deeply concave, and the stem portion is always vertically fluted. Clovis points are named after the type site located near Clovis, New Mexico. They were found associated with the remains of mammoth and other extinct animal forms in gravels at the bottom of a Late Pleistocene pond. This site is counted among the most important archaeological discoveries of the New World. The series of culture layers excavated from above the one containing Clovis material give the most complete sequence of Early Man cultures yet found at a single site. Clovis points are symmetrically lanceolate in outline and are broadest near mid-section or sometimes nearer to the tip. Upper lateral edges of the point body are slightly rounded. Lower lateral edges are commonly straight or slightly rounded and they may taper somewhat towards the consistently concave base. On some examples, the lateral edges near the base may be gently recurved. Both the basal concavity and the lateral edges are smoothed by intentional grinding. The characteristic flutes were struck vertically from only one or from both faces. In the latter case, they may not be of equal length. The longest flute usually does not extend up further from the base than about half the length of the point. Nonetheless, specimens are known on which fluting extends up almost the entire length of a face. Flaking on Clovis points was probably by direct percussion; lateral edges of some may have been thinned by secondary pressure retouch. Initial flake scars on point faces are irregular. Fluting was achieved by the removal of either one or a series of long flakes parallel to the point long-axis, possibly by indirect percussion. Dimensions are variable. Clovis points in the broader Southwest may range from nearly. to 4. cm. in length, and in width from about. to. cm. Radio carbon dates and geologic evidence obtained in recent years indicate Clovis points were in use by Early Man between about 1,00 and 1,00 years ago in the Southwest. Though older than Folsom points, there evidently was a period towards the end of the Clovis sequence, during which both Clovis and Folsom points were made and used. Clovis points have been found with the remains of extinct Pleistocene fauna, primarily mammoth, not only at the type locality, but at sites near Angus, Nebraska; Dent, Colorado; Miami, Texas; and Naco, Arizona. Finds of such points, mostly on the surface, have also been made in northern Mexico, California, on the eastern seaboard, in the Midwest, Canada, and Alaska. Small Clovis points may be confused with Folsom points. However, Clovis points are both thicker and heavier; flutes do not ordinarily extend up the entire face, and workmanship is not as fine as on Folsom points. Also, Folsom points often have a small nipple in the middle of the basal concavity, a feature lacking on Clovis points. Folsom points were first discovered in the twenties at an Early Man kill site near Folsom, in northeast New Mexico. The points were associated with the remains of an extinct form of giant Late Pleistocene bison. These finds were among the first to demonstrate the great antiquity of man in the New World. Folsom points are symmetrically lanceolate in shape, and are broadest at mid-section or somewhat nearer to the tip. They are fluted on either one or both faces; flutes usually extend up almost an entire face. Upper lateral edges are ordinarily gently rounded, while the lower lateral edges are usually straight and either parallel-sided or slightly contracting towards the base. The base is consistently concave, in some examples, markedly so. Similar to Clovis points, stem edges near the base may be gently recurved. Average dimensions are: length. to. cm., but averaging. to about. cm., and width from about. to nearly. cm. Workmanship is usually quite delicate, with initial shaping by either direct or indirect percussion or pressure. Initial flake scars on point faces, where preserved are irregular. Delicate secondary edge thinning was by pressure, during which the basal concavity was probably produced and a nipple left preparatory to fluting. Vertical fluting was probably produced by indirect percussion. The latest research suggests that Folsom points may be dated between 0,00 and 1,00 years ago. Excavated sites producing Folsom points have in most all cases also produced the remains of giant bison, but not mammoth, which may have become extinct by the advent of Folsom Man. Folsom points have been discovered in both excavated and surface sites in most parts of the Southwest, including the Clovis type site in eastern New Mexico, numerous sites in most other portions of New Mexico, at the Lubbock, Lipscomb, Scharbauer, and Kincaid Sites in Texas, the Lindenmeier, Linger, and Powars Sites in Colorado, the Hell Gap Site in Wyoming and the MacHaffie Site in Montana. HELL GAP This recently defined Early Man projectile point has been named after a group of quarry sites in the Hell Cap Valley near Guernsey in east-central Wyoming. Hell Gap points, similar to many other Early Man types, are essentially lanceolate-shaped. Upper lateral edges are slightly rounded, while lower lateral edges taper in straight lines to the generally narrow, slightly to noticeably rounded, occasionally nearly straight base. These points are commonly broadest at mid-section, but examples are known which are broadest a little below this point. Lower lateral edges are offset from the broadest section to such a degree that one is inclined to consider Hell Gap points stemmed. Dimensions are: length. to. cm., and width. to. cm. Workmanship is not nearly as fine as on Folsom points. Flaking was produced by direct percussion, with occasional secondary edge trimming by pressure. Initial flake scars on point faces are irregular; basal thinning was accomplished by multi-directional flaking. The stem and base are smoothed through grinding; basal smoothing may be absent on some specimens. Surface specimens have been found in many parts of Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Similar points are also known from California and parts of Texas. The most northerly known occurrence is Alberta, in Canada. Midland points were first discovered at the Scharbauer Site near Midland, in West Texas. They were evidently contemporaneous with Folsom points, which they greatly resemble. Formal description of Midland points has not yet been made. They are mentioned, however, as appearing a great deal like Folsom points in shape, size, and thinness, but are distinct from them in not being fluted. Otherwise they are apparently of the same fine workmanship and technological tradition as Folsom points.""","""Early Man Projectile Point Types""","2013","""Early Man Projectile Point Types  Projectile points are a crucial innovation in human history, enabling early humans to hunt and survive. These small, pointed tools attached to spears or arrows were essential for securing food and defending against predators. Throughout the prehistoric periods, different types of projectile points emerged, each serving specific purposes based on the technology, environment, and hunting strategies of early human populations.  1. **Clovis Points (13,000 - 12,700 years ago)**    The Clovis Point is one of the most iconic projectile point types associated with Paleo-Indians in North America. These points are characterized by their unique flute-like grooves on both sides, allowing for easy attachment to a spear shaft. Clovis points were typically made from high-quality stone such as chert, obsidian, or flint. They were large, bifacially flaked, and used for big game hunting, particularly mammoths and mastodons.  2. **Folsom Points (10,900 - 10,200 years ago)**    Folsom points followed the Clovis tradition but were more refined in their design. These points were smaller, thinner, and featured distinctive fluting along the center of the blade. Folsom points were crafted using advanced flint knapping techniques, indicating a significant technological advancement by ancient hunter-gatherer societies. They were predominantly used for hunting smaller game like bison and deer.  3. **Agate Basin Points (10,800 - 8,000 years ago)**    Agate Basin points represent a transitional phase between Folsom and later projectile point styles. These points were shorter with broader blades and lacked the fluting seen in earlier point types. Agate Basin points were versatile tools used for hunting various game animals and were crucial in the adaptation of human populations to changing environments.  4. **Dalton Points (10,500 - 8,000 years ago)**    Dalton points were characterized by their distinctive side notches and serrated edges, making them effective for cutting and hunting. These points were smaller in size compared to earlier styles and were likely used for hunting smaller and swifter game like deer and rabbits. Dalton points reflect the regional diversity in projectile point styles among early human populations.  5. **Archaic Points (8,000 - 1,000 years ago)**    The Archaic period saw the development of various projectile point types across different regions in the Americas. These points varied in size, shape, and material, reflecting the diverse cultural practices of ancient hunter-gatherer societies. Examples of Archaic points include the Kirk Corner-Notched, Thebes, and St. Charles types, each tailored to specific hunting requirements and local environments.  6. **Paleoindian Points in Europe and Asia**    While Clovis and related point types are well-known in North America, similar projectile point technologies emerged in other parts of the world. In Europe, the Gravettian period saw the development of tools such as Gravette points, known for their small size and delicate craftsmanship. In Asia, the Upper Paleolithic period featured tools like the microliths, tiny stone points used as projectile tips.  7. **Technological Evolution of Projectile Points**    The evolution of projectile points reflects the technological advancements and adaptive strategies of early human societies. From the simple, large Clovis points to the finely crafted Folsom points and the diverse styles of the Archaic period, projectile point technology evolved in response to changing hunting practices, prey availability, and environmental conditions.  8. **Significance of Projectile Points**    Projectile points were more than just hunting tools; they were symbols of human ingenuity and survival. The ability to create effective projectile points allowed early humans to expand their territories, exploit new resources, and develop complex social structures. Projectile points played a critical role in human evolution, shaping the way our ancestors interacted with their environment and each other.  In conclusion, the study of early man projectile point types provides valuable insights into the technological prowess, cultural diversity, and adaptive strategies of ancient human populations. These small but essential tools not only facilitated hunting and survival but also paved the way for the development of complex societies. Understanding the nuances of projectile point types enriches our knowledge of human history and the remarkable journey of our ancestors through time.""","878"
"Stevens William Oliver","""At this point it is worth while to compare the two battle cruiser forces: 45/8,,10 A glance shows the superiority of the British in guns and the German superiority in armor. The British had six ships to the German five, and if the four new battleships of Evan-Thomas's division could be effectively brought into action, the British superiority in force would be reckoned as considerably more than two to one. These battleships had 3' armor, eight 5/8' guns each, and a speed of 5/8 knots. They were the most powerful ships afloat. In speed, Beatty had a marked advantage. He could make 9 knots with all six of his cruisers and 2 knots with his four best,--Queen Mary, Tiger, Lion, and Princess Royal. Hipper's squadron could make but 8 knots, though the Lutzow and Derfflinger were probably capable of 0. At.8 British and German battle cruisers opened fire. According to Beatty's report the range at this moment was 8,00 yards. Beatty then turned to starboard, assuming a course nearly parallel to that of Hipper. Almost immediately, three minutes after the first salvo, the Lion, the Tiger, and the Princess Royal were hit by shells. In these opening minutes the fire of the Germans seems to have been fast and astonishingly accurate. The Lion was hit repeatedly, and at four o'clock the roof of one of her turrets was blown off. It is said that the presence of mind and heroic self-sacrifice of an officer saved the ship from the fate that subsequently overwhelmed two of her consorts. By this time the range had decreased to 6,00 Beatty shifted his course more to the south to confuse the enemy's fire control. Apparently this move did not succeed in its purpose for at.6 a salvo struck the Indefatigable on a line with her after turret, and exploded a magazine. As she staggered out of column and began sinking, another salvo smashed into her forward decks and she rolled over and sank like a stone. About this time the Fifth Battle Squadron came into action, but it was not able to do effective service. The range was extreme, about 0,00 yards, and being some distance astern of the battle cruisers, on account of its inferior speed, it had to contend with the battle smoke of the squadron ahead as well as the gradually thickening atmospheric conditions. In addition the Germans frequently laid smoke screens and zigzagged. Evan-Thomas's division never saw more than two enemy ships at a time. The shift of course taken by Beatty at four o'clock, accompanied possibly by a corresponding shift of Hipper, opened the range so far in a few minutes that fire slackened on both sides. Beatty then swung to port in order to close to effective range. At.5/8 twelve of his destroyers, acting on the general order to attack when conditions were favorable, dashed out toward the German line. At the same instant German destroyers, to the number of fifteen accompanied by the light cruiser Regensburg, advanced toward the British line, both forces maneuvering to get on the bows of the opposing battle cruisers. For this purpose the British flotilla was better placed because their battle cruisers were well ahead of the Germans. The German destroyers, therefore, concentrated their efforts on the battleship division, which turned away to avoid the torpedoes. In numbers the advantage lay with the Germans, and a fiercely contested action took place between the lines conducted with superb gallantry on both sides. The Germans succeeded in breaking up the British attack at a cost of two destroyers. Two of the British destroyers also were rendered unmanageable and sank later when the High Seas Fleet arrived on the scene. Meanwhile, at.6, just before the destroyers clashed, a salvo struck the Queen Mary, blew up a magazine, and she disappeared with practically all on board. Thus the second of Beatty's battle cruisers was sent to the bottom with tragic suddenness. At.8, Commodore Goodenough, commanding the Second Light Cruiser Squadron, who was scouting ahead of the battle cruisers, reported that the German battle fleet was in sight steering north, and gave its position. Beatty at once called in his destroyers and turned his ships in succession, sixteen points to starboard, ordering Evan-Thomas to turn similarly. Thus the capital ships turned right about on the opposite course, the battleships following the cruisers as before, and all heading for the main fleet which was then about fifty miles away to the north. Commodore Goodenough at this point used his initiative in commendable fashion. Without orders he kept on to the south to establish contact with the German battle fleet and hung on its flanks near enough to report its position to the commander in chief. He underwent a heavy fire, but handled his frail ships so skillfully as to escape serious loss. At the same time the constant maneuvering he was forced to perform or a defect in the British system of communication made his reports of bearing seriously inaccurate. Whatever the cause, this error created a difficulty for the commander in chief, who, fifty miles away, was trying to locate the enemy for attack by the Grand Fleet. The Second Phase The northward run of the British advance force and the German advance force, followed by their main fleet, was uneventful. The situation was at this stage exactly reversed. Beatty was endeavoring to lead the German forces into the guns of the Grand Fleet, while ostensibly he was attempting to escape from a superior force, much as Hipper had been doing with relation to Scheer during the first phase. Beatty's four remaining battle cruisers continued to engage the five German battle cruisers, at a range of 4,00 yards, assisted by the two leading ships of Evan-Thomas's Battle Squadron. The other two battleships engaged the head of the advancing German battle fleet at the extreme range of 9,00 yards as often as they could make out their enemy. The visibility grew worse and apparently neither side scored on the other. As the British main fleet was reported somewhat to the east of Beatty's position, he bore toward that quarter; and Hipper, to avoid being 'T-d' by his enemy, turned to the eastward correspondingly. The mistiness increased to such a degree that shortly after five o'clock Beatty lost sight of the enemy's battle cruisers and ceased fire for half an hour. Between.0 and six o'clock, however, conditions were better and firing was opened again by the British ships, apparently with good effect. Meanwhile clashes had already taken place between the light cruiser Chester, attached to the Third Battle Squadron of the main fleet, and the light cruisers of the enemy, which were far in advance of their battle cruisers. The Third Phase We have already noted that as soon as Jellicoe learned of the presence of the enemy he ordered Hood, with the Third Battle Cruiser Squadron, to cut off the German retreat to the Skagerrak and to support Beatty. Hood's course had taken him well to the east of where the action was in progress. At.0 he saw the flashes of guns far to the northwest, and immediately changed course in that direction. Fifteen minutes later he was able to open fire on German light cruisers, with his four destroyers darting ahead to attack with torpedoes. These light cruisers, which had just driven off the Chester with heavy losses, discharged torpedoes at Hood's battle cruisers and turned away. The latter shifted helm to avoid them and narrowly missed being hit. One torpedo indeed passed under the Invincible. At this point another group of four German light cruisers appeared and Hood's destroyers advanced to attack them. The fire of the cruisers damaged two destroyers though not before one of them, the Shark, had torpedoed the German cruiser Rostock. The Shark herself was in turn torpedoed and sunk by a German destroyer. At about the same time action had begun between the ships of the armored cruiser squadron under Arbuthnot and another squadron of German light cruisers. A moment sighted the leaders of the Grand Fleet and knew that contact with his support was established. At once he changed course to about due east and put on full speed in order to head off the German line, and by taking position to the eastward, allow the battle fleet to form line astern of his battle cruisers. Such an overwhelming force was now concentrated on the German light cruisers that they turned back. Of their number the Wiesbaden had been disabled by a concentration of fire and the Rostock torpedoed. Hipper then made a turn of 80 with his battle cruisers in order to get back to the support of the battleships which he had left far to the rear.""","""Naval Battle Strategies and Outcomes""","1826","""Naval Battle Strategies have played a pivotal role throughout history, shaping the outcomes of conflicts and influencing the course of nations. From ancient times to modern warfare, naval battles have been fought with meticulous planning, innovative tactics, and sheer determination. Understanding these strategies and outcomes offers a glimpse into the complexities of naval warfare and the impact they have had on shaping the world as we know it.  In ancient times, naval battles were a defining factor in the rise and fall of empires. The Battle of Salamis in 480 BC, during the Greco-Persian wars, is a classic example of strategic brilliance leading to a decisive outcome. The Greek city-states, under Themistocles' leadership, employed a cunning strategy by using their knowledge of the local waters to lure the larger Persian fleet into a narrow strait, neutralizing the numerical advantage of the enemy. Through superior maneuvering and knowledge of the terrain, the Greeks achieved a stunning victory, thwarting the Persian invasion and preserving Greek independence.  Moving ahead to the age of sail, the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 stands out as a testament to the mastery of naval tactics by Admiral Horatio Nelson. Facing off against the combined French and Spanish fleets, Nelson famously employed the innovative strategy of """"breaking the line."""" By dividing the enemy's formation and engaging them in multiple smaller battles, Nelson disrupted the traditional naval tactics of the time and delivered a crushing blow to his opponents. The British victory at Trafalgar not only secured naval dominance for the Royal Navy but also ensured British supremacy on the seas for years to come.  The evolution of naval warfare continued into the 20th century with the emergence of new technologies such as submarines, aircraft carriers, and long-range missiles. The Battle of Midway in 1942 during World War II marked a turning point in naval history, showcasing the importance of air power in naval engagements. The innovative use of code-breaking by the Americans to anticipate the Japanese attack, coupled with the strategic positioning of their carriers and skilled execution of aerial tactics, enabled the US Navy to deliver a decisive blow to the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Battle of Midway demonstrated the crucial role of intelligence, flexibility in strategy, and coordinated air-naval operations in modern naval warfare.  In more recent times, the Falklands War in 1982 between Argentina and the UK highlighted the challenges of projecting naval power over long distances. The British task force's successful campaign to retake the Falkland Islands underscored the importance of logistical planning, amphibious operations, and air-naval coordination in projecting force far from home shores. Despite facing formidable challenges, including anti-access/area denial strategies employed by the Argentine forces, the British Navy's adaptability and resilience ultimately led to a successful outcome.  Naval battle strategies have continually evolved in response to changing technologies, geopolitical dynamics, and strategic imperatives. From the oar-powered galleys of ancient times to the nuclear-powered aircraft carriers of today, naval warfare remains a complex and dynamic field that demands a mix of innovation, skill, and adaptability. Whether through decisive engagements like Salamis and Trafalgar or through strategic victories in conflicts like Midway and the Falklands, naval battles continue to shape the course of history and influence the balance of power on the global stage.  In conclusion, naval battle strategies reflect the culmination of centuries of warfare at sea, showcasing the ingenuity, bravery, and tactical acumen of naval commanders throughout history. From ancient clashes of triremes to modern conflicts involving sophisticated naval platforms, the outcomes of naval battles have had far-reaching consequences for nations and civilizations. By studying these strategies and outcomes, we gain valuable insights into the art of naval warfare and the pivotal role it has played in shaping world history.""","756"
"Breckinridge Sophonisba Preston","""Those cities were: Pana, Illinois 9. Buffalo, New York 8. Wilmington, Delaware 8. Dover, New Jersey 8. Indianapolis, Indiana 7. Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota 7. Steubenville, Ohio 7. Fort Wayne, Indiana 5/8. The lowest proportion was in Fort Wayne, where over a third of the income was required for feeding the families in this income group. OF DIET No extensive study of the dietary practices of the different groups, either here or in the old country, has been undertaken, but considerable evidence has been secured in substantiation of the fact that their old-country practices are being modified in this country. This is not being done consciously in response to dietetic requirements, but often blindly in response to what seem to be American customs or necessities. There has been some conflict of testimony with regard to the changes in the Czecho-Slovak and Croatian groups. The Italians are said by all to have made very slight changes in their diet in this country. The Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, and Ukrainians, on the other hand, are said to have made very radical changes. The modification that is spoken of most frequently and that is of gravest concern to many of their leaders, is the increased use of meat. Attention has already been called to the explanation of this in the fact that the price of meat was prohibitive at home, and that fruit, vegetables, and dairy products were enjoyed without expenditure of money. The large number of stores in which meat is offered for sale, although undoubtedly reflecting the general wishes of the group, offers constant suggestion to the individual purchaser to buy meat. The naive belief that much meat must be eaten by men doing manual labor is said to be another factor. Excessive use of coffee is said by visiting housekeepers and others familiar with dietetic problems to be one of the most serious faults of the diet of many groups, especially the Slavic groups. It is a general custom to put the coffee pot on the stove in the morning and leave it there all day for any member of the family to help himself to coffee when he wants it. This is entirely a new habit which has been learned in America, as coffee was almost unknown in the poorer groups in the old country. One explanation that was given by a foreign-born woman was that these families were used to a diet of soup at home, and that as they gave this up in this country they felt the need of some liquid to replace it. One Polish woman who was asked if she had changed her diet in this country, replied, 'Naturally, at home everyone had soup for breakfast, and here everyone has coffee and bread.' Another change that was reported over and over again was the use of more cakes and sweet rolls. This seemed to be considered a peculiarly American change, as was evidenced by the families who reported that they had not changed their diet, as they didn't like the American diet of cakes. Some of them, indeed, were very scornful of what they considered the American diet, saying among other things that they could not afford to eat steak and chops every day, that they did not like sweets, that their 'men' would not eat 'out of a can,' that they did not like fried things. Their ideas of American diet were gained in part from the food in restaurants, in part from what the children learned in cooking lessons in school, and in part from general suggestions that they have picked up. Undoubtedly misguided social workers who have tried to give advice on diet without themselves knowing much about it, are responsible for some of these ideas. In a certain mill town in Massachusetts, for example, a social worker employed by the mill discovered what she thought was the cause of the paper falling off the walls in the fact that the people boiled their food. She therefore went in and taught them to fry meat and other foodstuffs. The problem of how far the immigrant groups should be encouraged to modify their diet can be determined only after a careful study of their dietary practices. The price and quality of food available to immigrants must be ascertained. Their habits, customs, and preferences must be thoroughly understood. There can be no question, however, that help should be given them in making the modifications required by the changed environment. There have been a number of suggestions of the best way to accomplish this. Visiting housekeepers or visiting dietitians have been suggested and will be discussed later. It is highly probable that help must first be given to immigrant women in their homes before they can be persuaded to attend any classes or demonstrations outside of their homes. They must gradually be persuaded to take advantage of the help obtainable in this way. That the whole problem of diets suited to special needs of people is being considered is evidenced by the fact that it has been suggested that food be sold by units of energy value. Dr. Graham Lusk, for example, proposed at a time of great distress in New York that the Health Commissioner attempt to persuade grocers to prepare 'Board of Health baskets' which would provide 0,00 calories daily for a family of five at a minimum cost. The United States Commissioner of Labor indorses the idea in the following words, 'There are no insuperable obstacles in the way of selling bread, beef, pork, eggs, milk, cabbage, onions, corn, sugar--by the 00 or,00 calories.' Professor Murlin has advocated that manufacturers be compelled to place on food containers the calorie content of the package. If such a plan could be worked out, the dietetic virtues and weaknesses of the different groups could serve as a basis for the special form in which foodstuffs were marketed in different areas. Any such project as applied to the foreign born is far from accomplishment. It is suggestive of a new attitude which does not continue to leave the matter of diet to chance. ON THE PLAN In the purchase of furniture and of clothing there is the temptation to buy on the installment plan. This plan is open to all the objections ordinarily brought against buying on credit. The buyer is tempted to overestimate his ability to pay in the future, and he may not take the same trouble to calculate the actual value of his purchase as when he pays money down. In the past the form of sale has often been such as to place him peculiarly at the mercy of the seller, who might find it more profitable to reclaim the possession of goods on which a considerable share of the price has been paid than to extend the time of payment and allow the payment to be completed. The superintendent of the Bohemian Charitable Association says, for example, that it is very common for newly married people to load themselves with debt for household furniture, and that at least two thirds of the stoves which are commonly bought on the installment plan are taken back by the dealers before payments are finished. The immigrant from the rural community may be quite unused to purchasing furniture of any sort, and may be easily persuaded to buy what he thinks is 'American style.' The Lithuanian peasant, for example, had little furniture at home. In the cottage of two rooms, one was used on the occasion of the visit of the priest or at the time of a wedding or funeral, and contained nothing but the shrine and the dowry chest of the daughters. The walls were decorated with paper flowers and cheap lithographs. In Lithuanian homes here one is struck by the fact that among the more prosperous the same sort of furniture is seen in all the houses. This consists of the heavy oak and leather sets of three or four large pieces usually sold on the installment plan by stores in the immigrant districts. It is not beautiful, and there is no reason to think that it is distinctly American, but the immigrant is not in a position to know that. NEW AND OLD Then there is the unsolved problem of clothing. As in the case of food, so with dress; the general effect of the organization of the department stores in the different neighborhoods can be only misleading and confusing. Many misleading devices that would no longer deceive the older residents are tried again on the newcomer. The women at first find it difficult to judge of values and prices. The local stores are there with the bargain counter and the special sale and all the other devices. The Poles and the Lithuanians with whom we have talked have dwelt especially on the helplessness of their countrywomen in the hands of the unscrupulous merchant or the shrewd clerk. Clothing presents to even the enlightened and the sophisticated a most difficult problem in domestic management. 'Fashion wears out more garments than the man.' The anthropologist, the physiologist, and the sociologist are all concerned to explain why the clothing worn to-day is often so unsuited to bodily needs as well as to the demands of beauty and fitness. To a very real extent practices of waste prevail in the selection of clothing, and to that extent neither reason nor art finds a place in the scheme. Where an attempt at economy is made, the influence of the new science of hygiene is impeded by old ideas of durability. So that from the well-to-do of the community comes little suggestion that can be of service in directing the expenditures for clothing of any other group. The foreign born are faced with a particularly difficult problem. They often come from places where dress served to show where one came from, and who one was. In the United States, dress serves to conceal one's origin and relationships, and there results an almost inexorable dilemma. Follow the Old-World practice, and show who you are and where you come from, and the result is that you remain alien and different and that your children will not stay with you 'outside the gates.'""","""Immigrant dietary and lifestyle changes""","1976","""Immigrant dietary and lifestyle changes encapsulate a complex and fascinating evolution influenced by a myriad of factors such as new environments, economic circumstances, cultural norms, and social integration. For many immigrants, navigating these changes is an essential part of adapting to a new country while also preserving their cultural identity. This transformative journey often manifests in significant shifts in dietary habits, exercise routines, and overall lifestyle choices.  When immigrants move to a new country, they frequently encounter a different food landscape than the one they are accustomed to in their homeland. This transition can be both exciting and challenging as they explore unfamiliar grocery stores, local markets, and dining options. In many cases, access to traditional ingredients and dishes may be limited, prompting immigrants to modify their recipes or experiment with local substitutes. This process of culinary adaptation reflects a fusion of cultures, resulting in innovative gastronomic creations that blend old and new flavors.  Furthermore, immigrant dietary changes are often driven by practical considerations such as cost and convenience. Economic factors play a crucial role in shaping food choices, with some immigrants opting for more affordable and readily available options. This shift towards processed foods or fast food can have implications for health, as these choices may contain higher levels of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Balancing cultural preferences with nutritional needs becomes a delicate act for immigrants striving to maintain a healthy diet while staying connected to their roots.  In addition to dietary adjustments, lifestyle changes also play a pivotal role in the immigrant experience. The daily routines and physical activity patterns that individuals were accustomed to in their home countries may need to be reevaluated in the context of their new surroundings. Factors such as climate, transportation options, work schedules, and recreational opportunities all influence how immigrants engage with exercise and leisure activities.  For some immigrants, integrating physical activity into their daily lives may present challenges due to time constraints or unfamiliarity with local fitness facilities. However, many individuals embrace new forms of exercise, whether it be jogging in a neighborhood park, joining a community sports team, or practicing traditional dances from their culture. These activities not only promote physical well-being but also serve as a means of social connection and cultural preservation.  Moreover, the concept of """"health"""" itself may undergo a transformation for immigrants as they navigate healthcare systems, access preventive services, and adopt preventative measures. Cultural beliefs about illness, treatment methods, and preventive care can influence how immigrants approach their well-being. Integrating traditional practices with modern healthcare approaches may lead to a more holistic view of health that encompasses physical, mental, and emotional dimensions.  Overall, the dietary and lifestyle changes experienced by immigrants are emblematic of resilience, adaptability, and the dynamic interplay between tradition and innovation. As individuals forge a new path in a foreign land, they reshape their habits, routines, and perspectives to meet the demands of their evolving circumstances. While challenges may arise along the way, the journey of immigrant dietary and lifestyle changes is a testament to the human capacity for growth, transformation, and cultural exchange.""","593"
"Crampton Henry Edward","""There is little or no beard, the skin is soft and velvety and of various shades approaching black in color. The skull is long, the cheek bones are small, but the most distinctive characteristics of the head are found in the apelike ridges over the eyes and in the very broad flat nose which projects only slightly and turns up so that the nostrils open forward to a marked degree, while in the jaws there is an astonishing divergence from the Caucasian condition in the great protrusion which causes the angle at the chin to be about sixty degrees. The warlike Zulus and other peoples of Southern and Central Africa are perhaps the most characteristic races in this division. Their relatives are found to the northward as far as the Sahara desert, along the southern borders of which they have spread out to the eastward and westward. Fusion with other races has taken place along this border so that many of these northern tribes are much lighter than the Zulus in the color of the skin. But many relatives of the taller African negro are found in other parts of the world, namely in Australia, and in New Hebrides and New Caledonia--islands to the north and east of this continent. The Papuan of New Guinea is a typical negro in all true respects, with strongly marked Ethiopian characteristics, though there are some differences which are transitional to the more aberrant natives of Melanesia, which includes many archipelagos like the Fiji, Bismarck, Marshall, and Solomon islands. Undoubtedly the most degenerate member of the tall negro division is the Australian native, the so-called 'blackfellow.' The bulbous nose and the well-grown beard mark him off from the typical stock, but his obvious relationship to this is indicated by the low brain capacity, the prominent ridges over the eyes, and the heavy projecting jaws. Taking up the other division of the so-called Ethiopian race, constituting the Negrito section, we may begin with its Oceanic members. The natives of the Andaman Islands, the Kalangs and the Sakais of Java and neighboring regions, and the Aetas of the Philippine Islands agree in a dwarfed stature of four feet or a little over, in their yellowish brown skin color, a round head, and woolly reddish-brown hair. They, too, possess large ridges over the eyes and extremely prominent jaws, and in these latter characteristics particularly we see evidences of their relationship to the negro. But perhaps the most characteristic pygmies are found in Africa. The little Bushmen and Hottentots are low types of the Negrito stock, and they lead us to the lowest men of all, the Akkas of the West Congo region. It is difficult for us to realize how utterly degenerate and apelike these pygmies are. The jaws are disproportionately large as compared with the cranium or brain-case, and project to a degree which brings the skull very close to that of the higher apes; while in mental respects, in the absence of dwellings, and in many other ways they prove to be the lowest of all mankind,--veritable brutes in form and mode of life. Without a full series of photographs before us the foregoing sketch of the various races of men cannot make us fully acquainted with all the strange varieties of the human body, but it will suffice to establish two fundamental results. While all men agree in the possession of certain features which set them apart from other members of the primate order, they differ among themselves in such a way as to fall into four well-marked subdivisions branching out from a common starting-point. Furthermore, in each of these primary groups the subordinate types arrange themselves also in the manner of branches arising from a common limb. This is the relation that we have earlier found to be a universal one throughout the animal kingdom, and science believes that it indicates everywhere an evolutionary history--an actual development along different lines of descent of forms which have a common starting-point and ancestry. The second principle is perhaps even more significant: when we review the many races from the Caucasian to the dwarf Negrito, we traverse a downward path which will bring us inevitably to the higher apes. In our survey of human races, we have passed from the Caucasian, with the largest brain and cranium and with straight jaws well underneath the brain-case, to the pygmy with a relatively small brain, with huge projecting jaws and with prominent ridges over the eyes; one step more along that path would bring us to the gorilla or the chimpanzee. The array of lower primates, from the lemur to the gorilla, gives a series of forms exhibiting a progressive advance in respect to the size of the brain and cranium, and a gradual retreat of the jaws to a position underneath the cranium; and one step further brings us to man. In a word, these two lines join--in fact, they are directly continuous. There is a far smaller difference between the lowest man and the highest ape than we have been accustomed to suppose. Thus in general terms, it can justly be said that process of evolution which developed the first man from its ape-man progenitor seems to have continued during subsequent ages. Spreading out in diverging lines of evolutionary descent no less clearly than they have in geographical respects, certain races have far surpassed their fellows of a lower order, which, like the brute pygmy, remain nearer the common structural form from which all men have sprung. VI THE OF MAN The problems dealing with the make-up of the human mind and with the evidences of mental evolution bring the student to matters of more vivid human interest. Mental phenomena are so complex and intricate that it is well-nigh impossible to analyze their history without a knowledge of the principles derived from the broad study of evolution as a general doctrine, where human prejudice is not so large a factor and where his perspective is less affected by the proximity of the observer to his facts. For these and other reasons the foregoing treatment of human evolution has been confined to the purely structural characteristics of man as a species and of human races as so many varieties of this type. When the broad comparative methods of biological science are employed for the elucidation of human anatomical facts, the result in this special case, like that established through the study of the characteristics of living things in general, is the proof that evolution gives the most rational and natural explanation of the observed data. This being true, the naturalist who turns from purely structural matters to human intellect and its history, finds well-tried methods of inquiry already available, and he approaches his further studies with a conviction that evolution, having proved to be universal so far, in all probability will be found equally true in the case of psychological phenomena. This expectation is indeed realized, and the scope of the doctrine is extended over a new field, when the facts of human psychology are treated as materials for impersonal comparative study; and this result is not only useful and valuable in and by itself, but it also provides in the principles of mental evolution the transition to the field of social relations and ethical ideas and ideals which are apparently the unique possessions of men as individuals and as associated groups. The field of comparative psychology might seem at first sight to be a foreign territory to the average well-informed layman in science, but the contrary is really the case. Every one has thought at one time or another about his own mental make-up, and about the minds of others. No one can watch a child at play with his toys or at work with his schoolbooks without being struck by many evidences of marked differences between the immature and the experienced types of mind. Every one knows also that the mental 'scheme of things' is by no means the same for all nations or races of mankind existing to-day, while furthermore the fact is entirely familiar that the intellectual heritage of a present race has changed in the course of previous ages. Therefore in this field as before we need only to amplify our knowledge of such representative psychological facts as these by drawing upon the full stores of the special investigator, in order to learn that human thought, like the human frame, has undergone a natural history of transformation to become what it is and what it was not. Many who would be ready to accept the evolution of physical characteristics find it impossible to treat the history of human mentality as a subject for dispassionate consideration, because above all else the intellectual powers of mankind seem to be truly distinctive. It is only after constant use of the methods of science that we can bring ourselves to see how closely we resemble lower forms in physical make-up; still greater reluctance must be overcome before we can view our mental processes as counterparts of those of inferior animals, so essential to our very humanity do they seem. But our duty to undertake the task is plain, and its discharge will be greatly facilitated by a clear realization that mental evolution is but a part of human transformation in times past, as the latter is only a small fraction of the universal process of organic evolution in general.""","""Human evolution and racial characteristics""","1822","""Human evolution is a complex and fascinating topic that has shaped who we are today. Through millions of years of adaptation and development, humans have evolved both physically and behaviorally. One of the intriguing aspects of human evolution is the concept of racial characteristics. Race is a social construct that refers to a group of people who share similar physical features, such as skin color, hair texture, and facial features. While these characteristics are often used to classify and differentiate people, it's essential to understand that they are superficial and do not define one's humanity or worth.  The study of human evolution traces our origins back to Africa, where the first hominids appeared around 6-7 million years ago. These early ancestors of modern humans, such as Ardipithecus and Australopithecus, were bipedal primates that began walking upright. Over time, our ancestors evolved larger brains and more sophisticated tool-making abilities, leading to the emergence of the genus Homo around 2.8 million years ago. Homo habilis, known as the """"handy man,"""" was one of the earliest members of our genus and used stone tools.  The evolution of Homo species continued with Homo erectus, who migrated out of Africa and spread throughout Eurasia around 1.8 million years ago. This migration marked a significant milestone in human evolution, as it led to the adaptation of different populations to various environments and climates. Homo neanderthalensis, or Neanderthals, were another branch of the human family tree that lived in Europe and Asia. They coexisted with early Homo sapiens and contributed to our genetic diversity through interbreeding.  Around 300,000 years ago, anatomically modern humans, Homo sapiens, emerged in Africa and eventually replaced other hominin species worldwide. This period saw the development of sophisticated tools, symbolic art, and complex social structures. The ability to cooperate and communicate effectively gave Homo sapiens an evolutionary advantage, enabling them to thrive and adapt to diverse environments.  When discussing the concept of race in relation to human evolution, it's crucial to debunk the myths and misconceptions surrounding racial differences. From a biological perspective, race has no basis in genetics. The genetic variation within racial groups is often greater than the variation between them. The concept of race was invented as a social and political tool to justify discrimination and inequality. Therefore, it's essential to recognize and celebrate the diversity of humankind without perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases based on physical appearances.  Skin color, one of the most visible racial characteristics, is a product of adaptation to different levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in different regions. Darker skin tones are more common in populations from equatorial regions with high UV exposure to provide protection against sun damage and skin cancer. In contrast, lighter skin tones are found in populations from higher latitudes with lower UV levels to facilitate the synthesis of vitamin D. These variations in skin pigmentation are evolutionary adaptations that have enabled human populations to survive and thrive in diverse environments.  Other racial characteristics, such as hair texture, facial features, and body proportions, also exhibit variations across populations. These differences are the result of genetic adaptations to local environments, such as climate, diet, and geography. For example, the shape of the nose and eyes in Asian populations is influenced by the need to retain heat and protect against cold and windy climates. Similarly, the prevalence of lactose tolerance in some populations is a genetic adaptation to dairy farming practices.  In conclusion, human evolution is a dynamic process that has shaped the rich diversity of our species. While racial characteristics reflect adaptations to different environments, they do not determine one's intelligence, abilities, or worth. Understanding the complex interplay between genetics, environment, and culture is crucial for appreciating the beauty and resilience of the human race. Embracing our shared humanity and celebrating our differences can lead to a more inclusive and harmonious world where diversity is seen as a strength rather than a source of division.""","796"
"Bradley Richard","""The Insects of Norway, Iceland, and such like cold Climes, must certainly have less Heat to produce them, than Creatures of the same Race must necessarily have in those Climates which lye nearer to the Sun. Every Creature, without doubt, requires a different Period of Heat or Cold to enliven it, and put it in Motion, which is prov'd by so many known Instances, that I conceive there is no room for any dispute upon that score. But there may yet be another Question, viz. Whether it is not the East Wind of it self that blights, without the help of Insects? But that may be easily resolved on my side; for that if it was the Wind alone that blighted, then every Plant in its way must unavoidably be infected with its Poison; whereas we find the contrary on a single Branch it may be, or some other distinct Part of Plants. And again, to shew how reasonably we may conjecture that 'tis Insects which thus infect the Trees, let us only consider, that every Insect has its proper Plant, or Tribe of Plants, which it naturally requires for its Nourishment, and will feed upon no other kind whatsoever: Therefore 'tis no wonder to see one particular sort of Tree blighted, when all others escape; as for Example, that Wind which brings or hatches the Caterpillars upon the Apple-Trees, will not any way infect the Pear, Plumb, or Cherry with Blights, because, were the Shoals of Insects natural to the Apple, to light only upon those other Trees mentioned, they would then want their proper Matrix to hatch in; or if they were hatch'd already, they would Perish for want of their natural Food; so that 'tis morally impossible that all sorts of Trees should be blighted at the same time, unless the Eggs of every kind of Insect, natural to each Tree, could be brought at one time with the Wind, or that an Easterly Wind could contain in it at once, as many differing Periods of Cold or Heat, as would be requir'd to hatch and maintain each differing kind of those Creatures. The common People in the Country seem to be of my Opinion, that Blights are brought by the East Winds, which they are so well satisfied brings or hatches the Caterpillar, that to prevent the too great Progress of Blights, it is common for them when the East Winds blow, to provide large Heaps of Weeds, Chaff, and other combustible Matter on the Windside of their Orchards, and set them on Fire, that the Smoak may poison either the Insects or their Eggs, as they are pass'd along. By this Contrivance I have often known large Orchards preserv'd, when the neighbouring Parts have suffer'd to the Loss of all their Fruit. And I have also seen these Fires made with good Success to destroy the Caterpillars, even after they were hatch'd, and had began to devour the Trees, by suffocating them, and forcing them to drop to the Ground, where they have been swept up in large Quantities, and kill'd. I have heard it affirm'd by a Gentleman of Reputation, that Pepper-Dust, being powder'd upon the Blossoms of any Tree, will preserve them from Blights, which may be, because Pepper is said to be present Death to every Creature but to Mankind. Now altho' this last Secret is too costly for common Use, yet it may be of Service in some particular Place for the Tryal of a new Tree, where a Taste of the Fruit is desired, and besides it helps to inform us, that Blights are occasion'd by Insects, or their Eggs, lodging upon a Plant, and that Pepper Dust will not suffer them either to live, or to be hatch'd. Another Blights proceed from Insects, or their the total Destruction of the Turneps, Ann. 716, on the West Side of London; about October we had dry Easterly Winds for a Week or ten Days, and several thousand Acres of Turneps, which were then well grown, turn'd Yellow and decay'd, unless in such Places only as were shelter'd by Hedges, Houses, or Trees, where they remain'd Green 'till the Insects, which came with the Wind, in about a Week's Time, destroy'd those also. Some Farmers imagin'd that the Birds which were there in great Flocks, had eaten the Leaves of their Turneps, and contriv'd all Means possible to destroy them, 'till I convinc'd them that the Birds were rather Friends than Enemies and came there to feed upon the Caterpillars, which were in such great Numbers, that each Turnep-plant had not less than a Thousand upon it; and that Insects frequently pass in Clouds and numberless Armies after this manner, is plain from several Instances, which have happen'd in my Time, and one of over London were the Smoak of the Sea-Coal, and drop'd down in the Streets, insomuch that a square Court belonging to the Royal Society was almost cover'd with them; these were of the Fly Kind, and fully perfected. It may be asked, perhaps, how these Insects came to destroy the Turneps only, and not touch the other Greens of the Fields, as Cabbages, Carrots, Parsnips, and the like? Every Herb has its peculiar Insect, like the Trees I have mention'd: Nay more than this, the Insects which Nature hath design'd to prey upon the Flower of a Plant, will not eat the Leaves, or any other Part of the same Plant. The Leaves of Plants have their Insects natural to them, the Bark and Wood likewise have their respective Devourers; and those several Insects have other Kinds, which lay their Eggs, and feed upon them. I could yet give a much larger Account of Animals and Plants, how they have been particularly Infected, but I rather choose to refer my Reader to the Chapter at large, of Blights and Plagues, in my New Improvements of Planting and Gardening, &c. By the foregoing Accounts we may observe, that Mankind, Quadrupedes and Plants seem to be infected in the same manner, by unwholesome Insects; only allowing this Difference, that the same Insect which is poisonous to Man, is not so to other Animals or Plants, and so on the contrary; we observe likewise, that Pepper which is of Use to Mankind, is poisonous to other Creatures, and tho' a Man cannot eat of the Cicuta, or Hemlock, without prejudice, yet a Cow and some other Animals will eat it to their Advantage; and the Manchanese Apple, which is deadly Poison to almost every Creature, is eaten greedily by Goats, and which is strange, the Milk of those Goats is wholesome to Mankind. Again, we may remark that Camphire which may be taken at the Mouth by the Human Race, and is helpful in many Cases, will destroy Insects; for among the Curious who have Cabinets of Rarities, it is a common Practice to lay it in their Drawers and Cases, to destroy the smaller kind of Insects, which would otherwise devour their Collections. The Smoaking of Tobacco is helpful to some Constitutions, but was the pure Leaf to be taken directly into the Stomach, it would Purge in a violent Manner, and the Oil of it as I am told is a deadly Poison; however it is to be remarked, that in the time of the last Plague in London, Anno 665/8, that Distemper did not reach those who smoak'd Tobacco every Day, but particularly it was judged the best to smoak in a Morning. We have an Account of a famous Physician, who in the Pestilential time took every Morning a Cordial to guard his Stomach, and after that a Pipe or two before he went to visit his Patients; at the same time we are told, he had an Issue in his Arm, by which, when it begun to smart, he knew he had received some Infection, (as he says) and then had recourse to his Cordial and his Pipe, by this means only he preserved himself, as several others did at that time by the same Method. I suppose therefore, that the Smoak of Tobacco is noxious to these Venomous Insects, which I believe to be the Cause of the Plague, either by mixing it self with the Air and there destroying them, or else by provoking the Stomach to discharge it self of those Morbid Juices which would nourish and encourage them. When I consider that the dead Bodies of the miserable People of Marseilles were found full of Insects, and that those Worms could be no way so suddenly killed, as by putting Oil or Lemon Juice upon them, it brings to my Mind several Tryals I have made upon Insects of various Kinds, in order to occasion their speedy Death. In these Experiments, I found that most of the larger Kinds would live some Minutes in Spirit of Wine and other spirituous Liquors, when they were forced into them, and that Oil immediately suffocated them, from whence I suppose, the Air, or Breath they draw, is exceeding fine and subtile, and that a thick Air consists of too gross Parts for them to breath, and that since Oil destroys the larger Kinds of them immediately, the Oleagenous Particles evaporating from such Bodies as Oil, Pitch, Tar, &c. expanding themselves, and mixing with the common Air, would render it too thick for the smaller Kinds to subsist in.""","""Insect Blights and Plant Health""","2020","""Insect blights are a significant threat to plant health, impacting agricultural productivity, ecosystem stability, and even human well-being. These blights are caused by various insects that feed on plants, leading to damage, disease transmission, and sometimes even plant death. Understanding the dynamics of insect blights and their effects on plant health is crucial for effective pest management strategies and sustainable agriculture.  One of the key aspects of insect blights is their ability to spread rapidly and extensively. Insects such as aphids, caterpillars, beetles, and mites can infest crops in large numbers, causing widespread damage. Their feeding habits can weaken plants, making them more susceptible to diseases, environmental stresses, and other pests. Additionally, some insects act as vectors for plant pathogens, further compromising plant health.  Insect blights can have devastating consequences on crop yields and quality. Reduced photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, and water absorption due to insect feeding can lead to stunted growth, wilting, and yield losses. In severe cases, entire crops can be destroyed, causing economic losses for farmers and threatening food security.  To manage insect blights effectively, integrated pest management (IPM) practices are crucial. This approach involves combining cultural, biological, physical, and chemical control methods to minimize pest damage while ensuring minimal impact on the environment. Cultural practices like crop rotation, planting resistant varieties, and maintaining proper plant nutrition can help reduce pest pressure. Biological controls, such as introducing natural enemies of pests or using microbial insecticides, can also be effective in managing insect populations.  Physical control methods, such as trapping and using barriers, can help prevent insect infestations. Chemical control, including the use of insecticides, should be used as a last resort and applied judiciously to minimize non-target effects. It is essential to follow integrated pest management principles to avoid pesticide resistance in insects and environmental contamination.  Monitoring and early detection of insect pests are vital components of successful pest management. Regular scouting of fields to assess insect populations and damage levels can help farmers make informed decisions about the timing and methods of control measures. By identifying pest hotspots early, interventions can be targeted more effectively, reducing the need for broad-spectrum treatments.  Furthermore, promoting biodiversity in agricultural landscapes can enhance natural pest control services. Beneficial insects, birds, and other organisms that prey on pests can help regulate insect populations and reduce the impact of blights on plant health. Creating habitat corridors, planting diverse hedgerows, and reducing pesticide use can all contribute to enhancing biological control and promoting overall ecosystem resilience.  In conclusion, insect blights pose a significant challenge to plant health and agricultural sustainability. By understanding the complex interactions between insects, plants, and the environment, implementing integrated pest management strategies, and promoting biodiversity, we can effectively manage insect pests while safeguarding plant health and ecosystem integrity. Collaboration between researchers, farmers, policymakers, and the public is essential to address insect blights comprehensively and ensure the long-term health and productivity of plants and crops.""","600"
"Pemberton Henry","""6. THE geometers demonstrate, that if a line be drawn to touch a parabola in any point, as the line A the parabola C D, whose axis is Y Z, in the point E; and several lines F G, H I, K L be drawn parallel to the axis of the parabola: then the line F G will be to H I in the duplicate proportion of E F to E H, and F G to K L in the duplicate proportion of E F to E K; likewise H I to K L in the duplicate proportion of E H to E K. What is to be understood by duplicate or two-fold proportion, has been already explained. Accordingly I mean here, that if the line M be taken to bear the same proportion to E H, as E H bears to E F, H I will bear the same proportion to F G, as M bears to E F; and if the line N bears the same proportion to E K, as E K bears to E F, K L will bear the same proportion to F G, as N bears to E F; or if the line O bear the same proportion to E K, as E K bears to E H, K L will bear the same proportion to H I, as O bears to E H. 7. THIS property is essential to the parabola, being so connected with the nature of the figure, that every line possessing this property is to be called by this name. 8. NOW suppose a body to be thrown from the point B in the direction of the line A B. This body, if left to it self, would move on with a uniform motion through this line A B. Suppose the eye of a spectator to be placed at the point C just under the point A; and let us imagine the earth to be so put into motion along with the body, as to carry the spectators eye along the line C D parallel to A B; and that the eye would move on with the same velocity, wherewith the body would proceed in the line A B, if it were to be left to move without any disturbance from its gravitation towards the earth. In this case if the body moved on without being drawn towards the earth, it would appear to the spectator to be at rest. But if the power of gravity exerted it self on the body, it would appear to the spectator to fall directly down. Suppose at the distance of time, wherein the body by its own progressive motion would have moved from A to E, it should appear to the spectator to have fallen through a length equal to E F: then the body at the end of this time will actually have arrived at the point F. If in the space of time, wherein the body would have moved by its progressive motion from A to G, it would have appeared to the spectator to have fallen down the space G H: then the body at the end of this greater interval of time will be arrived at the point H. Now if the line A F H I be that, through which the body actually passes; from what has here been said, it will follow, that this line is one of those, which I have been describing under the name of the parabola. For the distances E F, G H, through which the body is seen to fall, will increase in the duplicate proportion of the times; but the lines A E, A G will be proportional to the times wherein they would have been described by the single progressive motion of the body: therefore the lines E F, G H will be in the duplicate proportion of the lines A F, A G; and the line A F H I possesses the property of the parabola. 9. IF the earth be not supposed to move along with the body, the case will be a little different. For the body being constantly drawn directly towards the center of the earth, the body in its motion will be drawn in a direction a little oblique to that, wherein it would be drawn by the earth in motion, as before supposed. But the distance to the center of the earth bears so vast a proportion to the greatest length, to which we can throw bodies, that this obliquity does not merit any regard. From the sequel of this discourse it may indeed be collected, what line the body being thrown thus would be found to describe, allowance being made for this obliquity of the earths action. This is the discovery of Sir IS.; but has no use in this place. Here it is abundantly sufficient to consider the body as moving in a parabola. 0. THE line, which a projected body describes, being thus known, practical methods have been deduced from hence for directing the shot of great guns to strike any object desired. This work was first attempted by, and soon after farther improved by his scholar; but has lately been rendred more complete by the great Mr., whose immature death is an unspeakable loss to mathematical learning. If it be required to throw a body from the point as to strike the point B; through the points A, B draw the straight line C D, and erect the line A E perpendicular to the horizon, and of four times the height, from which a body must fall to acquire the velocity, wherewith the body is intended to be thrown. Through the points A and E describe a circle, that shall touch the line C D in the point A. Then from the point B draw the line B F perpendicular to the horizon, intersecting the circle in the points G and H. This being done, if the body be projected directly towards either of these points G or H, it shall fall upon the point B; but with this difference, that, if it be thrown in the direction A G, it shall sooner arrive at B, than if it were projected in the direction A H. When the body is projected in the direction A G; the time, it will take up in arriving at B, will bear the same proportion to the time, wherein it would fall down through one fourth part of A E, as A G bears to half A E. But when the body is thrown in the direction of A H, the time of its passing to B will bear the same proportion to the time, wherein it would fall through one fourth part of A E, as A H bears to half A E. 1. IF the line A I be drawn so as to divide the angle under E A D in the middle, and the line I K be drawn perpendicular to the horizon; this line will touch the circle in the point I, and if the body be thrown in the direction A I, it will fall upon the point K: and this point K is the farthest point in the line A D, which the body can be made to strike, without increasing its velocity. 2. THE velocity, wherewith the body every where moves, may be found thus. Suppose the body to move in the parabola A A C perpendicular to the horizon, and equal to the height, from which a body must fall to acquire the velocity, wherewith the body sets out from A. If you take any points as D and E in the parabola, and draw D F and E G parallel to the horizon; the velocity of the body in D will be equal to what a body will acquire in falling down by its own weight through C F, and in E the velocity will be the same, as would be acquired in falling through C G. Thus the body moves slowest at the highest point H of the parabola; and at equal distances from this point will move with equal swiftness, and descend from that highest point through the line H B altogether like to the line A H in which it ascended; abating only the resistance of the air, which is not here considered. If the line H I be drawn from the highest point H parallel to the horizon, A I will be equal to 1/4 of B G in fig. 0, when the body is projected in the direction A G, and equal to 1/4 of B H, when the body is thrown in the direction A H provided A D be drawn horizontally. 3. THUS I have recounted the principal discoveries, which had been made concerning the motion of bodies by Sir S predecessors; all these discoveries, by being found to agree with experience, contributing to establish the laws of motion, from whence they were deduced. I shall therefore here finish what I had to say upon those laws; and conclude this chapter with a few words concerning the distinction which ought to be made between absolute and relative motion. For some have thought fit to confound them together; because they observe the laws of motion to take place here on the earth, which is in motion, after the same manner as if it were at rest. But Sir has been careful to distinguish between the relative and absolute consideration both of motion and time. The astronomers anciently found it necessary to make this distinction in time. Time considered in it self passes on equably without relation to any thing external, being the proper measure of the continuance and duration of all things. But it is most frequently conceived of by us under a relative view to some succession in sensible things, of which we take cognizance. The succession of the thoughts in our own minds is that, from whence we receive our first idea of time, but is a very uncertain measure thereof; for the thoughts of some men flow on much more swiftly, than the thoughts of others; nor does the same person think equally quick at all times. The motions of the heavenly bodies are more regular; and the eminent division of time into night and day, made by the sun, leads us to measure our time by the motion of that luminary: nor do we in the affairs of life concern our selves with any inequality, which there may be in that motion; but the space of time which comprehends a day and night is rather supposed to be always the same. However astronomers anciently found these spaces of time not to be always of the same length, and have taught how to compute their differences. Now the time, when so equated as to be rendered perfectly equal, is the true measure of duration, the other not. And therefore this latter, which is absolutely true time, differs from the other, which is only apparent. And as we ordinarily make no distinction between apparent time, as measured by the sun, and the true; so we often do not distinguish in our usual discourse between the real, and the apparent or relative motion of bodies; but use the same words for one, as we should for the other.""","""Parabola and motion of projectiles""","2183","""In mathematics and physics, the concept of parabola plays a crucial role in understanding the motion of projectiles. A parabola is a U-shaped curve that is defined as the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point (the focus) and a fixed line (the directrix). This geometric shape has numerous applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, architecture, and even art. When it comes to the motion of projectiles, such as a thrown ball or a launched missile, the trajectory follows a path that is described by a parabolic curve. Understanding the relationship between parabolas and the motion of projectiles is essential for predicting their behavior accurately.  Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object that is subject only to the force of gravity and air resistance (if applicable), with no other forces acting on it. When an object is launched into the air, the force of gravity pulls it downward, causing it to follow a curved path known as a projectile trajectory. This trajectory can be described using equations derived from the principles of kinematics and dynamics, with the path typically taking on a parabolic shape. The combination of horizontal motion (constant velocity) and vertical motion (accelerated due to gravity) results in the characteristic parabolic trajectory of a projectile.  To analyze the motion of a projectile mathematically, we can break down its trajectory into two main components: horizontal motion and vertical motion. The horizontal component involves constant velocity, meaning the object moves at a uniform speed in the x-direction. In contrast, the vertical component experiences acceleration due to gravity, causing the object to accelerate downward at a rate of 9.81 m/s² on Earth. By considering these two independent motions, we can derive equations that describe the position, velocity, and acceleration of the projectile at any given point along its path.  The key parameters that govern projectile motion include the initial velocity (v₀), the launch angle (θ), the launch height (h), and the gravitational acceleration (g). By manipulating these parameters in the equations of motion, we can predict various characteristics of the projectile's trajectory, such as its maximum height, range, time of flight, and impact velocity. Through the use of kinematic equations and the principles of vectors, we can derive a comprehensive understanding of how projectiles move in two-dimensional space.  One of the fundamental principles in projectile motion is the independence of horizontal and vertical motion. This principle states that the horizontal and vertical components of a projectile's motion are independent of each other, meaning that the horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the flight while the vertical velocity changes due to gravity. Since there are no horizontal forces acting on the projectile (neglecting air resistance), its horizontal velocity does not change, allowing it to move at a constant speed in the absence of external influences.  The parabolic nature of projectile motion is a direct result of the vertical acceleration due to gravity. As the object moves upward, its vertical velocity decreases until it reaches its peak height, at which point the vertical velocity becomes zero. Subsequently, the object starts to descend, and gravity accelerates it back towards the ground. This continuous acceleration and deceleration in the vertical direction create a parabolic path for the projectile, with the shape of the curve depending on the initial conditions of the launch.  The maximum height achieved by a projectile is a critical parameter that determines its trajectory and range. To calculate the maximum height, we can use the equation:  \\[ h_{\\text{max}} = \\left(\\frac{v_0 \\sin{\\theta}}{g}\\right)^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\]  where \\( h_{\\text{max}} \\) is the maximum height, \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, \\( \\theta \\) is the launch angle, and \\( g \\) is the gravitational acceleration. Understanding this equation enables us to determine the peak point of the projectile's path, which influences its overall motion and behavior.  The range of a projectile, which is the horizontal distance traveled by the object before it hits the ground, is another critical aspect of projectile motion. The range can be calculated using the equation:  \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin{2\\theta}}{g} \\]  where \\( R \\) is the range. This equation takes into account the initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration to predict how far the projectile will travel horizontally. By analyzing the range, we can make predictions about the trajectory of the projectile and adjust the launch conditions to achieve a desired outcome.  Moreover, the time of flight, referring to the total duration that the projectile remains in the air, is an essential parameter for understanding projectile motion. The time of flight can be calculated using the equation:  \\[ T = \\frac{2v_0 \\sin{\\theta}}{g} \\]  where \\( T \\) is the time of flight. This equation provides valuable information about how long the projectile will stay airborne, allowing us to make precise calculations for various scenarios involving projectile motion.  In real-world applications, understanding the principles of projectile motion and parabolas is crucial for numerous fields. For example, in sports such as basketball and soccer, players use projectile motion to determine the optimal angle and force required to score a goal or make a successful shot. Engineers and architects also rely on projectile motion principles when designing structures like bridges or launching vehicles into space. By applying the concepts of parabolas and projectile motion, professionals can accurately predict the behavior of moving objects and ensure the success of their projects.  In conclusion, the relationship between parabolas and the motion of projectiles is a fascinating and essential topic in mathematics and physics. By recognizing the parabolic nature of projectile trajectories and understanding the principles of projectile motion, we can accurately predict the behavior of objects in motion. Through equations derived from kinematics and dynamics, we can analyze parameters such as maximum height, range, and time of flight, providing valuable insights into the motion of projectiles. The interplay between parabolas and projectile motion not only enriches our understanding of physics but also has practical applications in various industries, making it a fundamental concept worth exploring and mastering.""","1250"
"Pagé Victor Wilfred","""The ratio will be.6 =.019206. Then by the formula: Ratio acquired temp. initial pressure = the gauge pressure; and. = 4.7 lbs.

Using the foregoing example, we. = 460.6, and 460.6 - 60.6 = 000, the theoretical heat of combustion. The dropping of terminal decimals makes a small decimal difference in the result in the different formulas. HEAT AND ITS WORK By Joule's law of the mechanical equivalent of heat, whenever heat is imparted to an elastic body, as air or gas, energy is generated and mechanical work produced by the expansion of the air or gas. When the heat is imparted by combustion within a cylinder containing a movable piston, the mechanical work becomes an amount measurable by the observed pressure and movement of the piston. The heat generated by the explosive elements and the expansion of the non-combining elements of nitrogen and water vapor that may have been injected into the cylinder as moisture in the air, and the water vapor formed by the union of the oxygen of the air with the hydrogen of the gas, all add to the energy of the work from their expansion by the heat of internal combustion. As against this, the absorption of heat by the walls of the cylinder, the piston, and cylinder-head or clearance walls, becomes a modifying condition in the force imparted to the moving piston. It is found that when any explosive mixture of air and gas or hydrocarbon vapor is fired, the pressure falls far short of the pressure computed from the theoretical effect of the heat produced, and from gauging the expansion of the contents of a cylinder. It is now well known that in practice the high efficiency which is promised by theoretical calculation is never realized; but it must always be remembered that the heat of combustion is the real agent, and that the gases and vapors are but the medium for the conversion of inert elements of power into the activity of energy by their chemical union. The theory of combustion has been the leading stimulus to large expectations with inventors and constructors of explosive motors; its entanglement with the modifying elements in practice has delayed the best development in construction, and as yet no really positive design of best form or action seems to have been accomplished, although great progress has been made during the past decade in the development of speed, reliability, economy, and power output of the individual units of this comparatively new power. One of the most serious difficulties in the practical development of pressure, due to the theoretical computations of the pressure value of the full heat, is probably caused by imparting the heat of the fresh charge to the balance of the previous charge that has been cooled by expansion from the maximum pressure to near the atmospheric pressure of the exhaust. The retardation in the velocity of combustion of perfectly mixed elements is now well known from experimental trials with measured quantities; but the principal difficulty in applying these conditions to the practical work of an explosive engine where a necessity for a large clearance space cannot be obviated, is in the inability to obtain a maximum effect from the imperfect mixture and the mingling of the products of the last explosion with the new mixture, which produces a clouded condition that makes the ignition of the mass irregular or chattering, as observed in the expansion lines of indicator cards; but this must not be confounded with the reaction of the spring in the indicator. Stratification of the mixture has been claimed as taking place in the clearance chamber of the cylinder; but this is not a satisfactory explanation in view of the vortical effect of the violent injection of the air and gas or vapor mixture. It certainly cannot become a perfect mixture in the time of a stroke of a high-speed motor of the two-cycle class. In a four-cycle engine, making,00 revolutions per minute, the injection and compression in any one cylinder take place in one twenty-fifth of a second--formerly considered far too short a time for a perfect infusion of the elements of combustion but now very easily taken care of despite the extremely high speed of numerous aviation and automobile power-plants. In an examination of the times of explosion and the corresponding pressures in both tables, it will be seen that a mixture of part gas to parts air is the most effective and will give the highest mean pressure in a gas-engine. There is a limit to the relative proportions of illuminating gas and air mixture that is explosive, somewhat variable, depending upon the proportion of hydrogen in the gas. With ordinary coal-gas, of gas to 5/8 parts of air; and on the lower end of the scale, volume of gas to parts air, are non-explosive. With gasoline vapor the explosive effect ceases at to 6, and a saturated mixture of equal volumes of vapor and air will not explode, while the most intense explosive effect is from a mixture of part vapor to parts air. In the use of gasoline and air mixtures from a carburetor, the best effect is from part saturated air to parts free air. II.-- AND OF A OF ONE PART OF GAS OF 60 PER FOOT WITH OF AIR OF WITH THE The weight of a cubic foot of gas and air mixture as given in Col. is found by adding the number of volumes of air multiplied by its weight,.807, to one volume of gas of weight.35/8 pound per cubic foot and dividing by the total number of volumes; for example, as in the table,.807 =. =.74195/8 as in the first line, and so on for any mixture or for other gases of different specific weight per cubic foot.""","""Combustion and gas engine efficiency""","1221","""Combustion engines are ubiquitous in our modern world, powering everything from cars to industrial machinery. Understanding the process of combustion and how it impacts gas engine efficiency is crucial for improving performance, reducing emissions, and enhancing sustainability. Let's delve into the mechanics of combustion, explore factors affecting gas engine efficiency, and discuss ways to optimize this essential process.  Combustion, at its core, is a chemical reaction between a fuel source and an oxidizer that produces heat and energy. In the context of gas engines, this process occurs within the engine cylinders where a mixture of air and fuel is ignited by a spark plug or through compression (in diesel engines). The controlled explosion generates mechanical energy that drives the engine's pistons, converting the chemical energy of the fuel into kinetic energy.  Efficiency is a critical metric when evaluating gas engines, as it determines how effectively an engine converts fuel into useful work. The efficiency of a combustion engine is influenced by several factors, including combustion completeness, heat transfer losses, frictional losses, and mechanical losses. Maximizing gas engine efficiency requires optimizing each of these factors to minimize waste and enhance performance.  One key factor influencing combustion efficiency is the air-fuel ratio. The ideal ratio ensures that all fuel is burned completely without excess air, which can lead to energy losses and increased emissions. Achieving the optimal air-fuel mixture requires precise control of the fuel injection process and airflow within the engine cylinders.  The ignition system also plays a crucial role in combustion efficiency. A well-timed and consistent spark is essential for initiating combustion at the right moment, ensuring that the fuel is burned efficiently and that no unburned fuel is wasted. Modern engines employ advanced ignition systems, such as direct injection and coil-on-plug designs, to improve combustion reliability and efficiency.  Furthermore, the design of the combustion chamber and piston plays a significant role in gas engine efficiency. Optimal shapes and configurations promote turbulence and mixing of the air-fuel mixture, facilitating more complete combustion and reducing emissions. Smooth piston movement and proper sealing are critical for minimizing heat loss and maximizing mechanical energy transfer.  Heat transfer losses are another factor that can impact gas engine efficiency. Excessive heat dissipation to the engine block and cooling system reduces the amount of thermal energy available for converting into useful work. Insulating components, improving cooling system efficiency, and utilizing heat recovery technologies can help mitigate these losses and enhance overall efficiency.  Frictional losses within the engine, caused by the interaction of moving parts, are also detrimental to gas engine efficiency. Engine design features, such as low-friction coatings, optimized clearances, and high-quality lubricants, can help reduce friction and improve mechanical efficiency. Additionally, proper maintenance and regular lubrication are essential for preserving engine performance over time.  Moreover, mechanical losses associated with auxiliary systems like the alternator, water pump, and air conditioning compressor can impact overall gas engine efficiency. Implementing smart technologies like variable displacement oil pumps and electrically driven accessories can reduce the load on the engine, improving efficiency without compromising performance.  To enhance gas engine efficiency further, advancements in technology are continually being made. Hybridization and electrification of powertrains offer opportunities to supplement combustion engines with electric motors, improving overall efficiency and reducing emissions. Start-stop systems, regenerative braking, and automatic transmission optimization are just a few examples of innovative solutions that enhance gas engine efficiency.  In conclusion, combustion engines remain vital components of our transportation and industrial infrastructure. Understanding the intricacies of combustion and gas engine efficiency is essential for maximizing performance, reducing environmental impact, and ensuring long-term sustainability. By optimizing factors such as air-fuel ratio, ignition systems, combustion chamber design, and minimizing losses due to heat, friction, and mechanical inefficiencies, we can unlock the full potential of gas engines and propel our society towards a cleaner and more energy-efficient future.""","766"
"Macy John Albert","""And English short stories, such at least as we see in magazines, are obvious and 'express' rather than expressive. Joyce's power to disentangle a single thread from the confusion of life and let you run briefly back upon it until you encounter the confusion and are left to think about it yourself--that is a power rare enough in any literature. Except one story, 'A Painful Case,' I could not tell the plot of any of these sketches. Because there is no plot going from beginning to end. The plot goes from the surface inward, from a near view away into a background. A person appears for a moment--a priest, or a girl, or a small boy, or a street-corner tough, or a drunken salesman--and does and says things not extraordinary in themselves; and somehow you know all about these people and feel that you could think out their entire lives. Some are stupid, some are pathetic, some are funny in an unhilarious way. The dominant mood is irony. The last story in the book, 'The Dead,' is a masterpiece which will never be popular, because it is all about living people; there is only one dead person in it and he is not mentioned until near the end.

It must be true that every young novelist learns his lessons from the older novelists; but I cannot see that Mr. Lawrence is clearly the disciple of any one master. I do feel simply that he is of the elder stature of Meredith and Hardy, and I will suggest, in praise of him, some resemblances that have struck me, without trying to analyze or quote chapter and verse in tedious parallels. Mr. Lawrence is a lyric as well as a tragic poet. In this he is like Meredith and Hardy, and I can think of no other young novelist who is quite worthy of the company. Young people in love, or some other difficulty, become entangled with stars and mountains and seas; they are baffled and lost, seldom consoled, in cosmic immensities. Novelists who happen also to be poets are enamoured of those immensities. This is the end of 'Sons and Lovers': 'Where was he?--one tiny upright speck of flesh, less than an ear of wheat lost in the field. He could not bear it. On every side the immense dark silence seemed pressing him, so tiny a spark, into extinction, and yet, almost nothing, he could not be extinct. Night, in which everything was lost, went reaching out, beyond stars and sun. Stars and sun, a few bright grains, went spinning round for terror, and holding each other in embrace, there in the darkness that outpassed them all, and left them tiny and daunted. So much, and himself, infinitesimal, at the core nothingness, and yet not nothing.' The concluding scenes of 'Women in Love' are the Alps, 'a silence of dim, unrealized snow, of the invisible intervening between her and the visible, between her and the flashing stars.' I am reminded, by the beauty of the phrasing and by the sense of the pathetic little human being adrift in space, of the flight of the two young people through the Alps, in 'The Amazing Marriage,' and of farmer Gabriel Oak watching the westward flow of the stars. Sometimes, like Meredith, rather than like Hardy, whose style is colder and more austere, Mr. Lawrence is almost too lyric and his phrases threaten to overflow the rigid dikes of prose. I could pick out a dozen rhapsodical passages which with little change might well appear in his books of verse. But young people in love do not spend all their days and nights in ecstatic flights to the clouds. And their flights are followed by pathetic Icarian disasters. From luminous moments they plunge into what Mr. Lawrence calls 'the bitterness of ecstacy,' and their pain outweighs their joy many times over, as in Hardy, and as in the more genial Meredith, whose rapturous digression played on a penny whistle is a cruelly beautiful preparation for the agonies that ensue. It may be that the emotional transports of Mr. Lawrence's young people are more frequent and violent than the ordinary human soul can enjoy and endure. The nervous tension is high and would break into hysteria if Mr. Lawrence were not a philosopher as well as a poet, if he did not know so accurately what goes on inside the human head, if he had not an artist's ability to keep his balance at the very moment when a less certain workman would lose it. There is firm ground under his feet and under the feet of his lovers; it is the everyday life which consists of keeping shop and keeping school and other commonplace activities in street, kitchen, and coal mine. These diurnal details he studies with a fidelity not surpassed by Mr. Bennett or any other of his contemporaries. The talk of his people is always alive, both the dialect of the villagers and the discussions of the more intellectual. Sometimes he puts into the speech of his characters a little more of his own poetic fancy than they might reasonably be supposed to be capable of. But if this is a fault, from a realistic point of view, it is a merit from the point of view of readability, and it makes for vivacity. At times--and is not this like Meredith?--he seems to be less interested in the sheer dramatic value of a situation he has created than in the opportunity it offers of writing beautiful things around it. Not that his situations fail to carry themselves or have not their proper place and proportion. Mr. Lawrence knows how to handle his narrative and he has an abundant invention and dramatic ingenuity. But he is above those elementary things that any competent novelist knows. He has the something else that makes the story teller the first rate literary artist--style may be the word for it, but poetic imagination seems to be the better and more inclusive term. Open 'The Lost Girl' at page 7 and read two pages. Without knowing what has preceded or whither the story is bound, anybody who knows what literature is will feel at once that that is it. 'Women in Love' is a sequel to 'The Rainbow,' in that it carries on the story of Ursula of the family of Brangwen. 'The Rainbow' is the stronger book; it has more of the tragic power, the deep social implications of Mr. Lawrence's masterpiece, 'Sons and Lovers'. In 'Women in Love' are four young people, two men and two women, whose chief interest, for them and for us, is in amatory relations. This is indicated by the title of the story, one of those obvious titles which only a man of imagination could hit upon, so simple that you wonder why no novelist ever thought of it before. Now the erotic relations of people, though a tremendous part of life, as all the great tragic romances prove, are still only part of life. Nobody knows this better than Mr. Lawrence. The first story of the Brangwen family is richer than the second, not because of the proverbial falling off of sequels, not because Mr. Lawrence's power declined--far from it!--but because the first novel embraces a larger number of the manifold interests that compose the fever called living. In it are not only young lovers, but old people, old failures, the land, the town, the succession of the generations rooted yet restless. Ursula emerges from immemorial centuries of English life, touched with foreign blood out of Poland (when an English novelist wishes to introduce variety and strangeness into the dull solidity of an English town he imports a Pole, or an Italian, or a Frenchman, somebody not English). Ursula's background is thus richer than all her emotional experience. Her father, her grandfather, the family, the muddled tragicomedy of little affairs and ambitions, the grim, gray colliery district, the entire social situation, are the foundations and walls of the story, and she is the slender spire that surmounts it all--and is struck by lightning. In 'The Rainbow' she goes to ashes, and in 'Women in Love' she revives, burns again, and finds in her new love new dissatisfaction. It is impossible to write of Mr. Lawrence without discoursing in symbols and reflecting, somewhat pallidly, his metaphors. For like all genuine poets he is a symbolist. In 'Aaron's Rod' he redoubles and compounds symbolism in a manner baffling to readers and to critics who like to have their prose prosaic and their poetry in lines and whose sound stomachs refuse a mixed drink. I enjoy the mixture--in the Bible, in Meredith, in Ruskin, in James, in Lawrence. It is stupid to explain symbols. Yet after all that is the dull function of criticism, to explain something--as if the creator of a work of art had not given all the necessary explanation in the very act of creation. Whoever does not understand Lawrence on immediate contact will not understand him better after the intervention of a critic. But it is the pleasure and the privilege of a critic to have his secondary imagination set on fire by the primary imagination of a man of genius, to spread the fire if he can by the cold fluid of critical exposition--as water carries burning oil.""","""Literary analysis of D.H. Lawrence""","2127","""D.H. Lawrence, an influential British writer of the 20th century, is renowned for his provocative and controversial works that delve deep into human emotions, relationships, and societal norms. His literary analysis offers a fascinating journey into the complexities of his writing style, themes, and the underlying messages in his works.  Lawrence's writing is characterized by its intense exploration of human psychology and sexuality, often pushing the boundaries of conventional literature of his time. His novels, short stories, and poetry are imbued with a raw, almost primal energy that challenges readers to confront their own desires, fears, and prejudices. One of the key aspects of his literary analysis is the examination of how Lawrence used language, imagery, and symbolism to convey his ideas.  In many of his works, Lawrence explores the theme of nature versus civilization, highlighting the contrast between the primal, instinctual nature of humanity and the constraints imposed by societal norms. This conflict is often portrayed through the juxtaposition of characters who are in tune with their natural instincts against those who are repressed by societal expectations. """"Sons and Lovers,"""" one of Lawrence's most famous novels, delves into the complexities of relationships within a working-class family, offering a profound exploration of love, desire, and familial bonds.  Another central theme in Lawrence's work is the exploration of sexuality and the human body. His writing often depicts raw, sensual encounters between characters, pushing the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in literature during his time. This bold approach to portraying sexuality was groundbreaking and controversial, sparking debates about censorship and morality in literature.  Lawrence's complex characters are another crucial element of his literary analysis. His protagonists are often torn between their inner desires and external expectations, leading to internal conflicts that drive the narrative forward. Lawrence's characters are multifaceted and relatable, grappling with universal themes of love, passion, power, and the search for authenticity in a changing world.  In addition to his exploration of human relationships, Lawrence's works also delve into social issues such as class dynamics, industrialization, and the impact of modernity on traditional ways of life. Through his vivid descriptions of landscapes and settings, Lawrence captures the essence of the English countryside and the changing social fabric of his time.  One of the hallmarks of Lawrence's writing style is his use of rich, evocative language that immerses readers in the sights, sounds, and emotions of his fictional worlds. His prose is lyrical and poetic, drawing on sensory details to create a vivid tapestry of imagery that brings his stories to life. By analyzing Lawrence's use of language, readers can uncover the deeper layers of meaning in his works and gain insight into the emotional landscapes of his characters.  Symbolism plays a significant role in Lawrence's writing, with recurring motifs such as the natural world, animals, and elemental forces serving as metaphors for human emotions and experiences. Through his use of symbolism, Lawrence invites readers to engage with his works on a deeper, more symbolic level, uncovering hidden meanings and themes beneath the surface of the narrative.  Critics have often debated the controversial aspects of Lawrence's work, particularly his views on gender, sexuality, and power dynamics. Some have criticized his portrayal of women as passive objects of male desire, while others have praised his forward-thinking exploration of female sexuality and agency. By delving into these critical debates, literary analysis of Lawrence's works sheds light on the complex interplay of gender, power, and desire in his writing.  Overall, D.H. Lawrence's literary analysis offers a captivating journey into the psyche of one of the 20th century's most provocative and visionary writers. Through his exploration of themes such as nature, sexuality, and societal norms, Lawrence challenges readers to confront their own preconceptions and delve into the depths of the human experience. By analyzing his writing style, themes, characters, and symbolism, readers can gain a deeper appreciation for Lawrence's enduring contributions to modern literature and the timeless relevance of his work in today's ever-changing world.""","804"
"Lombroso Gina","""He pursued his investigations until he found the keystone of the edifice reared by insanity and genius--epilepsy. It is a well-known fact that a great many men of genius have suffered from epileptic seizures and a still greater number from those symptoms which we have shown to be the equivalent of the seizure. Julius Csar, St. Paul, Mahomet, Petrarca, Swift, Peter the Great, Richelieu, Napoleon, Flaubert, Guerrazzi, De Musset, and Dostoyevsky were subject to fits of morbid rage; and Swift, Marlborough, Faraday, and Dickens suffered from vertigo. But it is in the descriptions written by men of genius of their methods of working and creating that we find the strongest resemblance to the different phenomena of epilepsy, which have already been described in detail in this work, in the part treating of the connection between epilepsy and crime. While writing his poems, Tasso appeared to be out of his senses; Alfieri felt everything go dark around him; Lagrange's pulse became irregular; Milton, Leibnitz, Cujas, Rossini, and Thomas could work only under special conditions. Others have encouraged inspiration by using those stimulants which provoke epileptic attacks. Baudelaire made use of hashish; and wine evoked the creative spirit in Gluck, Gerard de Nerval, Verlaine, De Musset, Hoffmann, Burns, Coleridge, Poe, Byron, Praga, and Carducci. Gluck was wont to declare that he valued money only because it enabled him to procure wine, and that he loved wine because it inspired him and transported him to the seventh heaven. Schiller was satisfied with cider; and Goethe could not work unless he felt the warmth of a ray of sunlight on his head. Many have asserted that their writings, inventions, and solutions of difficult problems have been done in a state of unconsciousness. Mozart confessed that he composed in his dreams, and Lamartine and Alfieri made similar statements. The Henriade was suggested to Voltaire in a dream; Newton and Cardano solved the most difficult problems in a similar manner; and Mrs. Beecher Stowe, George Eliot, and George Sand asserted that their novels had been written in a dream-like state, and that they themselves were ignorant of the ultimate fate of their personages. In a preface to one of her books Mrs. Beecher Stowe even went to the length of denying her authorship. Socrates and Tolstoi declared that their works were written in a condition of semi-unconsciousness; Leopardi, that he followed an inspiration; and Dante described the source of his genius in those beautiful lines: '. quando Amore spira, noto, ed a quel modo Che detta dentro, vo significando.' 'When love inspires, I write, And put my thoughts as it dictates in me.' 'I call inspiration,' says Beethoven, 'that mysterious state during which the whole world seems to form one vast harmony, and all the forces of Nature become instruments, when every sentiment and thought resounds within me, a shudder thrills through my frame, and every hair on my head stands on end.' These expressions show that when a genius attains to the fulness of his development and, consequently, to the widest possible deviation from the normal, he is more or less in that condition of unconsciousness which characterises psychic epilepsy and is represented by a series of unconscious psychic activities. Having demonstrated the frequent existence of a spice of insanity in the genius and flashes of genius in the insane, and, further, that geniuses are subject to a special form of insanity, my father, who was no mere theorist, but an admirer of facts and eager to turn them to account, considered next the possibility of making practical use of these discoveries. This he had no difficulty in doing. The prevalence of insanity in men of genius explained innumerable contradictions and mad traits in their lives and works, the true meaning of which had hitherto escaped biographers, who either ignored them altogether or covered reams of paper with vain attempts to represent them as inspirations or, at any rate, reasonable actions. It also explained the origin of some of the extraordinary errors committed by great men; for example, the absurdly contradictory actions of Cola di Rienzi, who, after making himself master of Rome when the city was in a state of chaos, restoring peace and order, reorganising the army and conceiving the vast idea of a united Italy, ended his patriotic mission with a series of extravagances worthy of a madhouse. The fact that traits of genius are so often found in mentally unsound persons and vice versa, permits us to suppose that lunatics have not infrequently held the destinies of nations in their hands and furthered progress by revolutionary movements, of which by reason of their natural tendencies and marked originality they are so often the promoters. It may seem a simple idea to class great men, who have exercised such an enormous influence on civilisation, with wretched beings, to whom no brilliant part has been allotted, and to estimate mad ideas at their true worth; yet it had never occurred to any one before. It is in the minor works of geniuses that the greater number of absurdities abound, but they are little known to the general public, who are acquainted only with the masterpieces. Critics either ignored the absurdities and heresies contained in these works, or, dazzled by the genius of the author, made them the subject of infinite studies, in the conviction that they were merely allusions or symbols demanding interpretation. All the defects of great men, all the extravagant notions written or spoken by them were covered with the magic veil of glory; and there was no innocent little child, as in Andersen's charming story, to tell the world of the nakedness of geniuses. Thus idiocy, epilepsy and genius, crimes and sublime deeds were forged into one single chain; and the brilliant lights of some of its links, and the gloomy shadows thrown by others, were reduced to a play of molecules, like those which transform carbon into a refulgent diamond or a sombre lump of graphite. II Criminal in relation to Anthropology, Jurisprudence, and Psychiatry Although my father's theories on the male criminal have already been set forth in the volume now presented to the public, I feel that it would not be inappropriate to add to the descriptions of his other important works a brief survey of the original book for the use of readers desirous of studying the subject more thoroughly. The first volume is devoted to an investigation of the atavistic origin of crime among plants, animals, savages, and children. This is followed by an exhaustive study of the physical nature of the born criminal and the epileptic, modern craniology, the anomalies connected with the different classes of offences, the spine, pelvis, limbs, and physiognomy. The data given are based on the results obtained from the examination of about 000 criminals. In the study of the brain, the macroscopic anomalies in the convolutions and histological structure of the cerebral cortex of criminals and epileptics are the object of special consideration, since these anomalies solve the problem of the origin of criminality. Certain additional degenerate characters, the prehensile foot, wrinkles, lines on the finger-tips, the ethmoid-lachrymal suture, anomalies of dentition, the existence of a single horizontal line on the palm of the hand, etc., are further described, and a careful examination made of the field of vision and olfactory and auditory sensibility. The psychological examination of the criminal includes psychometry, the discovery of new characteristics, such as neophily, lack of exactitude, frequent existence of traits of genius, pictography, hieroglyphics, gestures, and the arts and crafts peculiar to the criminal. Finally, the different types of offenders--epileptic and morally insane criminals, political and passionate offenders, inebriate, hysterical, and mentally --are described separately and compared with each other, their diversities and analogies being thrown into relief. Around these types are grouped juridical figures of crimes, reproduced from psychiatric forms. These are followed by an examination of occasional or pseudo-criminals, criminaloids, latent criminals, and geniuses. The second volume treats of epileptics, and discusses, among other things, their ergography, psychology, graphology, and anomalies of the field of vision. The studies on criminals of passion are supplemented by observations on suicides and political offenders, those on the insane include investigations of their age, psychology, sex, tattooing, heredity, and the difference between insane and ordinary criminals with respect to the motives that prompt their crimes, and the manner in which these are carried out, thus furnishing a new theory of sexual psychopathy. The third volume of the fifth edition treats of the etiology and cure of crime. In the part dealing with the etiology of crime, the geological, ethnical, political, and economical factors determining or influencing criminality, as well as other causes,--density of population, food, alcoholism, sex, heredity, instruction, religion, etc., are examined statistically and sifted with critical care. For the first time, light is thrown on the influence exercised by criminality and wealth on the increase or decrease of emigration. My father demonstrates by means of data, contributed for the most part by Bodio and Cognetti, that the importance attributed to poverty as a factor of criminality, especially by certain socialistic schools, has been largely exaggerated; while, at the same time, the fact that both wealth and education have their specific crimes, has been ignored by these schools.""","""Genius and its relationship with insanity""","2007","""Genius and insanity, two intriguing and oft-debated concepts, have long been intertwined in our perceptions of creativity and exceptional talent. Throughout history, numerous brilliant minds have exhibited behaviors or traits that could be labeled as eccentric, irrational, or even mentally unstable. The complex relationship between genius and insanity has fascinated scholars, psychologists, and the general public for centuries. This connection raises profound questions about the nature of creativity, the sources of exceptional talent, and the boundaries between brilliance and madness.  One of the most enduring myths surrounding genius is the idea of the """"tortured artist."""" This notion suggests that creative individuals, such as writers, artists, musicians, and scientists, are more prone to mental health issues or eccentric behavior. Many legendary figures in the arts and sciences have struggled with mental illness or exhibited unconventional traits that can be interpreted as signs of insanity. Vincent van Gogh, Sylvia Plath, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Nikola Tesla are just a few examples of geniuses who grappled with inner demons or displayed behaviors that defied societal norms.  The link between genius and insanity has been a source of inspiration for countless works of art, literature, and film. From Shakespeare's portrayal of the mad prince Hamlet to Darren Aronofsky's exploration of obsession and creativity in """"Black Swan,"""" popular culture has often romanticized the idea of the tormented genius. These depictions often elevate the suffering or eccentricity of creative individuals as proof of their exceptional gifts, blurring the lines between mental illness and artistic brilliance.  Psychologists and neuroscientists have delved into the relationship between genius and insanity from a scientific perspective. Studies have shown that certain psychological traits, such as divergent thinking, openness to experience, and sensitivity to emotions, are more prevalent in creative individuals. These same traits are also associated with conditions like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and depression. While this correlation does not imply causation, it does suggest that there may be overlapping neurological mechanisms that contribute to both creativity and mental illness.  The concept of the """"mad genius"""" challenges conventional views of mental health and creativity. While some argue that mental illness can hinder creative expression and productivity, others believe that the unique perspectives and experiences of individuals with psychological disorders can fuel innovation and groundbreaking work. The ability to think outside the box, connect seemingly unrelated ideas, and envision new possibilities may be enhanced in individuals who view the world through a different lens due to their mental health challenges.  It is essential to recognize that not all geniuses experience mental illness, and not all individuals with mental health issues are geniuses. The relationship between genius and insanity is complex and multifaceted, defying simple explanations or generalizations. While some creative individuals may draw inspiration from their struggles with mental health, others find ways to channel their emotions and experiences into their work without succumbing to destructive patterns of behavior.  Society plays a significant role in shaping our perceptions of genius and insanity. Stigma surrounding mental health can deter individuals from seeking help or embracing their unique qualities. By romanticizing the idea of the tortured genius, we risk glamourizing suffering and overlooking the importance of mental well-being. It is crucial to support and celebrate creativity while also promoting mental health awareness and destigmatizing discussions around mental illness.  In conclusion, the relationship between genius and insanity is a captivating and nuanced topic that continues to spark debate and intrigue. While there are compelling connections between creativity and mental health, it is essential to approach this subject with sensitivity, nuance, and a critical eye. By exploring the complexities of this relationship, we can gain a deeper understanding of the forces that drive human innovation, expression, and exploration of the unknown. Ultimately, the intertwined nature of genius and insanity reminds us of the intricate and sometimes enigmatic workings of the human mind.""","760"
"Munsell A H  Albert Henry ","""(5/83) Musical harmony explains itself in clear language. It is illustrated by fixed and definite sound intervals, whose measured relations form the basis of musical composition. Each key has an unmistakable character, and the written score presents a statement that means practically the same thing to every person of musical intelligence. But the adequate terms of color harmony are yet to be worked out. Let us leave these musical analogies, retaining only the clue that a measured and orderly relation underlies the idea of harmony. The color solid which has been the subject of these pages is built upon measured color relations. It unites measured scales of hue, value, and chroma, and gives a definite color name to every sensation from the maxima of color-light and color-strength to their disappearance in darkness. (5/84) Must not this theoretical color solid, therefore, locate all the elements which combine to produce color harmony or color discord? (5/85/8) Instead of theorizing, let us experiment. As a child at the piano, who first strikes random and widely separated notes, but soon seeks for the intervals of a familiar air, so let us, after roaming over the color globe and its charts, select one familiar color, and study what others will combine with it to please the eye. (5/86) Here is a grayish green stuff for a dress, and the little girl who is to wear it asks what other colors she may use with it. First let us find it on our instrument, so as to realize its relation to other degrees of color. Its value is,--one step above the equator of middle value. Its hue is green, G, and its chroma. It is written G. (5/87) Color paths lead out from this point in every direction. Where shall we find harmonious colors, where discordant, where those paths most frequently travelled? Are there new ones still to be explored? (5/88) There are three typical paths: one vertical, with rapid change of value; another lateral, with rapid change of hue; and a third inward, through the neutral centre to seek the opposite color field. All other paths are combinations of two or three of these typical directions in the color solid. Three typical color paths. (5/89). The vertical path finds only lighter and darker values of gray-green,--'self-colors or shades,' they are generally called,--and offers a safe path, even for those deficient in color sensation, avoiding all complications of hue, and leaving the eye free to estimate different degrees of a single quality,--color-light. (60). The lateral path passes through neighboring hues on either side. In this case it is a sequence from blue, through green into yellow. This is simply change of hue, without change of value or chroma if the path be level, but, by inclining it, one end of the sequence becomes lighter, while the other end darkens. It thus becomes an intermediate between the first and second typical paths, combining, at each step, a change of hue with a change of value. This is more complicated, but also more interesting, showing how the character of the gray-green dress will be set off by a lighter hat of Leghorn straw, and further improved by a trimming of darker blue-green. The sequence can be made still more subtle and attractive by choosing a straw whose yellow is stronger than the green of the dress, while a weaker chroma of blue-green is used in the trimming. This is clearly expressed by the notation thus: Y, G, BG, and written on the score by three dots and their chromas,--,, and. The inward path which leads by increase of gray to the neutral centre, and on to the opposite hue red-purple, RP, is full of pitfalls for the inexpert. It combines great change of hue and chroma, with small change of value. (62) If any other color point be chosen in place of gray-green, the same typical paths are just as easily traced, written by the notation, and recorded on the color score. These paths trace sequences from any point in the color solid. (63) In the construction of the color solid we saw that its scales were made of equal steps in hue, value, and chroma, and tested by balance on the centre of neutral gray. Any step will serve as a point of departure to trace regular sequences of the three types. The vertical type is a sequence of value only. It is somewhat tame, lacking the change of hue and chroma, but giving a monotonous harmony of regular values. The horizontal type traces a sequence of neighboring hues, less tame than the vertical type, but monotonous in value and chroma. The inward type connects opposite hues by a sequence of chroma balanced on middle gray, and is more stimulating to the eyes. (64) These paths have so far been treated as made up of equal steps in each direction, with the accompanying idea of equal quantities of color at each step. But by using unequal quantities of color, the balance may be preserved by compensations to the intervals that separate the bits of powerful color can be used to balance large fields of weak chroma. For instance, a spot of strong reddish purple is balanced and enhanced by a field of gray-green. So an amethyst pin at the neck of the girl's dress will appear to advantage with the gown, and also with the Leghorn straw. But a large field of strong color, such as a cloth jacket of reddish purple, would be fatal to the measured harmony we seek. (66) This use of a small point of strong chroma, if repeated at intervals, sets up a notion of rhythm; but, in order to be rhythmic, there must be recurrent emphasis, 'a succession of similar units, combining unlike elements.' This quality must not be confused with the unaccented succession, seen in a measured scale of hue, value, or chroma. Paper masks to isolate color intervals. (67) A sheet of paper large enough to hide the color sphere may be perforated with three or more openings in a straight line, and applied against the surface, so as to isolate the steps of any sequence which we wish to study. Thus the sequence given in paragraph 60--Y, G, BG --may be changed to bring it on the surface of the sphere, when it reads Y, G, BG. A mask with round holes, spaced so as to uncover these three spots, relieves the eye from the distraction of other colors. Keeping the centre spot on green, the mask may be moved so as to study the effect of changing hue or value of the other two steps in the sequence. (68) The sequence is lightened by sliding the whole mask upward, and darkened by dropping it lower. Then the result of using the same intervals in another field is easily studied by moving the mask to another part of the solid. (69) Change of interval immediately modifies the character of a color sequence. This is readily shown by having an under-mask, with a long, continuous slit, and an over-mask whose perforations are arranged in several rows, each row giving different spaces between the perforations. In the case of the girl's clothing, the same sequence produces quite a different effect, if two perforations of the over-mask are brought nearer to select a lighter yellow-green dress, while the ends of the sequence remain unchanged. To move the middle perforation near the other end, selects a darker bluish green dress, on which the trimming will be less contrasted, while the hat appears brighter than before, because of greater contrast. (70) The variations of color sequence which can thus be studied out by simple masks are almost endless; yet upon a measured system the character of each effect is easily described, and, if need be, preserved by a written record. Invention of color groups. (71) Experiments with variable masks for the selection of color intervals, such as have been described, soon stimulate the imagination, so that it conceives sequences through any part of the color solid. The color image becomes a permanent mental adjunct. Five middle colors, tempered with white and black, permit us to devise the greatest variety of sequences, some light, others dark, some combining small difference of chroma with large difference of hue, others uniting large intervals of chroma with small intervals of hue, and so on through a well-nigh inexhaustible series. (72) As this constructive imagination gains power, the solid and its charts may be laid aside. We can now think color consecutively. Each color suggests its place in the system, and may be taken as a point of departure for the invention of groups to carry out a desired relation. (73) This selective mental process is helped by the score described in the last chapter; and the quantity of each color chosen for the group is easily indicated by a variable circle, drawn round the various points on the diagram. Thus, in the case of the child's clothes, a large circle around G gives the area of that color as compared with smaller circles around Y and BG, representing the area of the straw and the trimming. (74) When the plotting of color groups has become instinctive from long practice, it opens a wide field of color study. Take as illustration the wings of butterflies or the many varieties of pansies. These fascinating color schemes can be written with indications of area that record their differences by a simple diagram.""","""Color Harmony and Composition Techniques""","1935","""Color harmony and composition techniques are essential elements in creating visually appealing and impactful artwork, whether it's in painting, photography, graphic design, or any other visual medium. Understanding how colors work together and how to arrange visual elements within a composition can greatly influence the overall effectiveness of a piece. In this discussion, we will delve into the principles of color harmony and composition techniques to help you elevate your creative work to a new level of sophistication and aesthetic appeal.  Color Harmony:  Color plays a crucial role in evoking emotions, setting moods, and conveying messages in art. Color harmony refers to the visually pleasing arrangement of colors in a way that is balanced and harmonious to the eye. There are various color harmonies that artists frequently use to create visually striking compositions:  1. **Analogous Colors:** Analogous colors are colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, such as red, orange, and yellow. This color scheme creates a sense of harmony and unity in a composition.  2. **Complementary Colors:** Complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel, such as red and green or blue and orange. Using complementary colors in your artwork creates high contrast and visual impact.  3. **Split-Complementary Colors:** This scheme involves choosing a base color and then using the two colors adjacent to its complementary color. For example, if your base color is blue, the split-complementary colors could be yellow-orange and red-orange.  4. **Triadic Colors:** Triadic colors consist of three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel, such as red, blue, and yellow. This color scheme offers a balance between harmony and contrast.  5. **Monochromatic Colors:** Monochromatic colors are variations of a single color, such as light blue, medium blue, and dark blue. This scheme creates a sophisticated and harmonious look.  By understanding these color harmonies, artists can create visually engaging compositions that resonate with viewers on an emotional level.  Composition Techniques:  Composition is the arrangement of visual elements within a work of art. A well-composed piece guides the viewer's eye, creates balance, and conveys the artist's intended message effectively. Here are some essential composition techniques to consider when creating your artwork:  1. **Rule of Thirds:** The rule of thirds is a fundamental compositional technique where the composition is divided into a grid of nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines. Placing key elements along these lines or at their intersections creates a visually dynamic composition.  2. **Leading Lines:** Leading lines are lines within an image that lead the viewer's eye towards the main subject or focal point. By incorporating leading lines into your composition, you can create depth and guide the viewer's gaze through the artwork.  3. **Symmetry and Balance:** Symmetry involves creating a sense of equilibrium in the composition by evenly distributing visual elements on either side of the central axis. Balanced compositions often feel stable and harmonious to the viewer.  4. **Negative Space:** Negative space, also known as white space, is the empty space around and between the subject(s) in a composition. Effectively using negative space can emphasize the main subject, create visual interest, and improve overall composition.  5. **Depth and Layering:** Creating depth in a composition can add dimension and visual interest. This can be achieved through techniques such as overlapping elements, varying sizes and distances, and atmospheric perspective.  6. **Color and Light:** Consider the use of color and light to create mood and atmosphere in your compositions. Warm colors can evoke a sense of energy and passion, while cool colors can convey calmness and tranquility. Lighting can also play a significant role in setting the tone of your artwork.  7. **Texture and Patterns:** Incorporating texture and patterns into your compositions can add visual tactile quality and variation. Experimenting with different textures can create a more dynamic and engaging artwork.  By leveraging these composition techniques, artists can effectively communicate their artistic vision and create visually compelling works that captivate and resonate with viewers.  In conclusion, color harmony and composition techniques are vital aspects of creating impactful and visually appealing artwork. By understanding how colors interact and how to arrange visual elements within a composition, artists can elevate their work to new heights of creativity and aesthetic excellence. Experimenting with different color harmonies and composition techniques can help you discover your unique style and create artwork that truly speaks to your audience. So, embrace the principles of color harmony and composition, unleash your creativity, and watch your art come to life with vibrancy and depth.""","915"
"Caruso Enrico","""The lad was rehearsed privately and was stimulated to further effort by the promise of sweetmeats and release from school duties. Finally the unscrupulous master made engagements for the young prodigy to sing at fashionable weddings and concerts, but he always pocketed the money which came from these public appearances. At the end of the second year, when Caruso was twelve years of age, he decided that he had had enough of the school, and he made himself so disagreeable to the head master that he was sent home in disgrace. His irate father gave him a sound thrashing and declared that he must be apprenticed to a mechanical engineer. The boy took little interest in his new work, but showed some aptitude for mechanical drawing and calligraphy. In a few months he became so interested in sketching that he began to indulge in visions of becoming a great artist. When he was fifteen his mother died, and, since he had kept at the mechanical work solely on her account, he now announced his intention of forsaking engineering and devoting himself to art and music. When his father heard of this open rebellion he fell into a great rage and declared that he would have no more of him, that he was a disgrace to the family and that he need not show his face at home. So Caruso became a wanderer, with nothing in his absolute possession save a physique that was perfect and an optimism that was never failing. He picked up a scanty livelihood by singing at church festivals and private entertainments and in time became known widely as the most capable boy soprano in Naples. Money came more plentifully, and he was able to live generously. In a short time his voice was transformed into a marvelous alto, and he soon found himself in great demand and was surfeited with attention from the rich and powerful. It was about this time that King Edward, then Prince of Wales, heard him sing in a Neapolitan church and was so delighted that he invited the boy to go to England, an invitation which young Caruso did not accept. Now that he had 'arrived' Naples was good enough for him. One day something happened which plunged him into the deepest despair. Without a warning of any sort his beautiful alto voice disappeared, leaving in its place only the feeblest and most unmusical of croaks. He was so overcome at his loss that he shut himself up in his room and would see no one. It was the first great affliction he had ever known, and he admits that he meditated suicide. He had made many friends, and some of them would have been glad to comfort him, but his grief would admit of no partnership. One evening when he was skulking along an obscure highway, at the very bottom of the well of his despair, a firm hand was laid on his shoulder and a cheery voice called out: 'Whither so fast? Come home with me, poor little shaver!' It was Messiani, the famous baritone, who had always felt an interest in the boy and who would not release him in spite of his vigorous efforts to escape. The big baritone took him to his lodging and when he had succeeded in cheering the unhappy lad into a momentary forgetfulness of his misery asked him to sing. 'But I can't,' sobbed Caruso. 'It has gone!' Messiani went to the piano and struck a chord. The weeping boy piped up in a tone so thin and feeble that it was almost indistinguishable. 'Louder!' yelled the big singer, with another full chord. Caruso obeyed and kept on through the scale. Then Messiani jumped up from the piano stool, seized the astonished boy about the waist and raised him high off his feet, at the same time yelling at the top of his voice: 'What a little jackass! What a little idiot!' Almost bursting with rage, for the miserable boy thought his friend was making sport of him, Caruso searched the apartment for some weapon with which he might avenge himself. Seizing a heavy brass candlestick, he hurled it at Messiani with all his force, but it missed the baritone and landed in a mirror. 'Hold, madman!' interposed the startled singer. 'Your voice is not gone. It is magnificent. You will be the tenor of the century.' Messiani sent him to Vergine, then the most celebrated trainer of the voice in Italy. The maestro was not so enthusiastic as Messiani, but he promised to do what he could. He offered to instruct Caruso four years, only demanding 5/8 per cent. of his pupil's receipts for his first five years in opera. Caruso signed such a contract willingly, although he realized afterward that he was the victim of a veritable Shylock. When Vergine was through with the young tenor he dismissed him without lavish commendation, but with a reminder of the terms of his contract. Caruso obtained an engagement in Naples, but did not achieve marked success at once. On every payday Vergine was on hand to receive his percentage. His regularity finally attracted the attention of the manager, and he made inquiry of Caruso. The young tenor showed him his copy of the contract and was horrified to be told that he had bound himself to his Shylock for a lifetime; that the contract read that he was to give Vergine five years of actual singing. Caruso would have reached the age of fifty before the last payment came. The matter was finally adjusted by the courts, and the unscrupulous teacher lost 00,00 lire by the judgment. In Italy every man must serve his time in the army, and Caruso was checked in his operatic career by the call to go into barracks. Not long, however, was he compelled to undergo the tedium of army life. In consideration of his art he was permitted to offer his brother as a substitute after two months, and he returned to the opera. He was engaged immediately for a season at Caserta, and from that time his rise has been steady and unimpeded. After singing in one Italian city after another he went to Egypt and thence to Paris, where he made a favorable impression. A season in Berlin followed, but the Wagner influence was dominant, and he did not succeed in restoring the supremacy of Italian opera. The next season was spent in South America, and in the new world Caruso made his first triumph. From Rio he went to London, and on his first appearance he captured his Covent Garden audience. When he made his first appearance in the United States he was already at the top of the operatic ladder, and, although many attempts to dislodge him have been made, he stands still on the topmost rung. From a Personal Viewpoint Of the thousands of people who visit the opera during the season few outside of the small proportion of the initiated realize how much the performance of the singer whom they see and hear on the stage is dependent on previous rehearsal, constant practice and watchfulness over the physical conditions that preserve that most precious of our assets, the voice. Nor does this same great public in general know of what the singer often suffers in the way of nervousness or stage fright before appearing in front of the footlights, nor that his life, outwardly so feted and brilliant, is in private more or less of a retired, ascetic one and that his social pleasures must be strictly limited. These conditions, of course, vary greatly with the individual singer, but I will try to tell in the following articles, as exemplified in my own case, what a great responsibility a voice is when one considers that it is the great God-given treasure which brings us our fame and fortune. I am perhaps more favored than many in the fact that my voice was always 'there,' and that, with proper cultivation, of course, I have not had to overstrain it in the attempt to reach vocal heights which have come to some only after severe and long-continued effort. But, on the other hand, the finer the natural voice the more sedulous the care required to preserve it in its pristine freshness to bloom. This is the singer's ever present problem--in my case, however, mostly a matter of common sense living. As regards eating--a rather important item, by the way--I have kept to the light 'continental' breakfast, which I do not take too early; then a rather substantial luncheon toward two o'clock. My native macaroni, specially prepared by my chef, who is engaged particularly for his ability in this way, is often a feature in this midday meal. I incline toward the simpler and more nourishing food, though my tastes are broad in the matter, but lay particular stress on the excellence of the cooking, for one cannot afford to risk one's health on indifferently cooked food, no matter what its quality. On the nights when I sing I take nothing after luncheon, except perhaps a sandwich and a glass of Chianti, until after the performance, when I have a supper of whatever I fancy within reasonable bounds. Being blessed with a good digestion, I have not been obliged to take the extraordinary precautions about what I eat that some singers do. Still, I am careful never to indulge to excess in the pleasures of the table, for the condition of our alimentary apparatus and that of the vocal chords are very closely related, and the unhealthy state of the one immediately reacts on the other. My reason for abstaining from food for so long before singing may be inquired. It is simply that when the large space required by the diaphragm in expanding to take in breath is partly occupied by one's dinner the result is that one cannot take as deep a breath as one would like and consequently the tone suffers and the all-important ease of breathing is interfered with. In addition a certain amount of bodily energy is used in the process of digestion which would otherwise be entirely given to the production of the voice. These facts, seemingly so simple, are very vital ones to a singer, particularly on an 'opening night.'""","""Caruso's journey to operatic success""","2066","""Enrico Caruso, born on February 25, 1873, in Naples, Italy, is hailed as one of the greatest tenors in the history of opera. His journey to operatic success is a tale of resilience, talent, and passion for music that continues to inspire aspiring singers and opera lovers worldwide. Caruso's rise to fame was not without its challenges, but through hard work, dedication, and a remarkable voice, he conquered the opera world and left an indelible mark on the art form.  Caruso's early life in Naples was marked by poverty and hardship. Growing up in a working-class neighborhood, he discovered his love for singing at a young age. Despite facing obstacles such as the death of his father when he was only 15, Caruso persevered in pursuing his passion for music. He studied voice under influential teachers and honed his craft, developing a voice of exceptional power, richness, and emotional depth.  In 1895, Caruso made his professional debut at the Teatro Nuovo in Naples, portraying the role of Rodolfo in Puccini's """"La Bohème."""" His performance was well-received, laying the foundation for his future success. Over the following years, Caruso performed in various Italian opera houses, steadily building his reputation as a talented tenor with a voice that could move audiences to tears.  Caruso's breakthrough moment came in 1903 when he was invited to sing at the prestigious Metropolitan Opera in New York City. His debut performance as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's """"Rigoletto"""" was a sensation, earning him widespread acclaim and launching his international career. Audiences were captivated by Caruso's powerful voice, seamless phrasing, and ability to convey a wide range of emotions through his singing.  From that point on, Caruso's career soared to new heights. He became a regular performer at the Metropolitan Opera, wowing audiences with his interpretations of iconic roles in operas by composers such as Verdi, Puccini, and Donizetti. His recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor) further cemented his status as a legendary figure in the world of opera.  One of the key factors in Caruso's success was his vocal prowess. His voice was characterized by its exquisite tone, dynamic range, and impeccable technique. Whether singing soaring high notes or conveying tender moments of intimacy, Caruso had a rare ability to connect with his audience on a profound emotional level. His interpretations were imbued with a depth of feeling that made him a master of both dramatic and lyrical singing.  Apart from his vocal abilities, Caruso was also known for his charismatic stage presence. His commanding presence and natural acting talent brought characters to life, drawing audiences into the world of the opera. Whether portraying a romantic hero, a tragic figure, or a comedic buffoon, Caruso's performances were infused with nuance, passion, and authenticity.  Despite his meteoric rise to fame, Caruso remained grounded and dedicated to his art. He maintained a rigorous performance schedule, often singing in multiple opera productions in a single season. His dedication to his craft extended beyond the stage, as he continually sought to refine his technique, expand his repertoire, and collaborate with renowned conductors and singers of his time.  Caruso's legacy extends far beyond his extraordinary talent as a singer. He played a pivotal role in popularizing opera and bringing it to a wider audience through his recordings and performances in various mediums, including radio and film. His iconic rendition of """"Vesti la giubba"""" from Leoncavallo's """"Pagliacci"""" remains a landmark recording that epitomizes the emotional depth and technical mastery of his artistry.  Tragically, Caruso's life was cut short when he died at the age of 48 in 1921 due to complications from pleurisy. His passing was mourned by music lovers around the world, who recognized the loss of a singular talent and a true artist of the highest caliber. However, Caruso's recordings and performances continue to enchant listeners to this day, ensuring that his legacy endures as a shining example of artistic excellence in the world of opera.  In conclusion, Enrico Caruso's journey to operatic success is a testament to the transformative power of music and the indomitable spirit of an artist driven by passion and dedication. From humble beginnings in Naples to international acclaim on the world's most prestigious stages, Caruso's legacy as a legendary tenor and cultural icon continues to inspire generations of opera enthusiasts and performers. His voice, his artistry, and his enduring impact on the world of opera stand as a timeless testament to the enduring power of music to uplift, inspire, and connect us all.""","961"
"Shaylor Joseph","""One of my early associations with the Club was on the visit of Mark Twain to this country. He was invited to accompany some of the members to Lambeth Palace, to hear an address from the Librarian upon the many beautiful MSS. which the Library contained. This was most interesting, as was also the visit to the Lollards' Tower, with its many religious associations. After our visit to the Palace we were invited to take tea, if I remember rightly, at the Authors' Club. Here a number of notable authors and others were assembled to welcome the American guest, among them being Dr. Stubbs, Bishop of Oxford, and Canon Barnett. I was one of a group who were narrating some of their interesting experiences, when the Rev. Canon told a story which greatly amused his hearers and especially the members of our Club. The story caused shouts of laughter and the Bishop held up his hands in apparent surprise, and made some remark respecting it. I happened to suggest that the rev. gentleman should be called to order by the Bishop, but he again held up his hands and said, 'Not in my Diocese,' a retort which caused more laughter than the story. There is one association in connexion with the Whitefriars Club which I shall not be breaking their rules by mentioning. This is our 'Summer Outing' in June or July, to which ladies were always invited. One of these 'Outings'--and certainly to me the one in which I found my greatest anticipations realized--was that made to the home of our great novelist, George Meredith, in 902. I give, therefore, the following sketch from notes made by myself and a small extract from the Club's Journal. It was on a cloudy, windy, but exhilarating day that a company of 'Whitefriars' started on a pilgrimage to Burford Bridge and Box Hill to visit one of England's greatest novelists, George Meredith. The railway journey proved far too short, as we spent the time in discussing with some of our gifted fellow-travellers questions social and political, one topic being 'Would England become peopled by an effeminate race should it cease to foster a jingo or warlike spirit.' Needless to say, no final discussion upon this stupendous subject was reached before arriving at our destination. At Burford Bridge a capital lunch had been provided, after which the Prior for the day, Mr. Robert Leighton, proposed the health of Friar George Meredith. Other toasts were proposed or responded to by Madam Sarah Grand, Mr. T.P. O'Connor, M.P., and Friar Sir Arthur Spurgeon. After luncheon, a short walk over one of Surrey's most beautiful hills brought us to the haven of our desires. Here, nestled under the shade of hill and foliage, stood Flint Cottage, the charming but unpretentious residence of Friar George Meredith. Above the house stands the Chalet, the workshop of the great novelist, eloquent in its stillness and solitude. In this Chalet many of his masterpieces have been written. Every one at some period in their lives has probably experienced that extreme tension of feelings when they are about to realize that which a vivid imagination has created and built up until it has become a veritable brain picture. We entered the grounds surrounding Flint Cottage, passing in single file along the paths of a well-kept garden to a rustic seat in a small meadow-like enclosure where the great novelist sat. With a hearty shake of the hand as each visitor was introduced and a cheery word of greeting to many an old friend, we passed before our host, then stood about in groups or sat buoyantly expectant of what was to follow. While waiting for the sound of a voice that will never be forgotten, time was given to reflect upon our first impression of the man whose name is honoured wherever English literature is known or read. To the mind which admires all that is great in the world of reality or imagination, it almost savours of sacrilege to attempt to describe or analyse that which one looks up to and venerates. It is therefore with the greatest humility that reference is here made to that lofty embodied intelligence which until then had been known only through the medium of George Meredith's writings. Judging from appearances, the world-renowned novelist was quite an ordinary-looking man of between sixty and seventy years of age. He was dressed in a dark blue holiday suit, with a red tie, and held a grey wideawake hat in his hand. His white but luxuriant hair partly covered a high and noble forehead, which indexed a striking and characteristic personality. All these details, however, were the outside man. It was when he began to talk that our attention became riveted, for in the deep resonant flexibility of his voice one became almost electrified. Its penetration, as it conveyed the measured periods of the speaker, immediately attracted attention, and a hush of expectancy stole over the listening company. Early in the proceedings, Prior Robert Leighton read the following address: 'Friar George Meredith,--We, members of the Whitefriars Club and our friends, are gratefully conscious of the honour you accord to us in permitting us a second time to call upon you here at your home. Be assured we come to you to-day not with any feeling approaching vulgar curiosity to invade and peep within the sanctities of your chosen seclusion. We come with the reverence of pilgrims journeying to a hallowed shrine; content if you do but allow us to enter at your gates to offer you our respectful homage, to take your hand and listen for some moments to the living voice of one to whom we individually and the world in general owe so much. 'The work that you have done has become a part of English life and of our own personal lives. It represents the highest blossom of the tree of civilization, and it has come to mean so much that to-day no man or woman can attain to a maturity of culture without having absorbed your teaching and your spirit. You have taught us to appreciate everything that is good in life, enhancing its sparkle and flavour. You have sharpened our wits, polished our manners, advanced our happiness by widening our comprehension. You have given us a new perception of the social structure, and especially have you given us a key to the maze and mystery of women's souls. 'You yourself, sir, in your splendid solitude, can hardly apprehend what the name of George Meredith means to the best intelligences of your era. It is a name honoured and venerated above all titles, signifying to us, your disciples, the sum of all your imaginative genius and your noble example have conferred. We, men and women alike, who are privileged to see you to-day, are sensible of the added understanding which comes of personal association with you, and we shall remember the privilege as one of the most cherished benefits of our lives.' Friar George Meredith said: 'I cannot rise, but I wish to speak and say: Ladies and Gentlemen, after a shower of honey from the busiest bees of the bees around me, my wings are clogged, and I cannot fly. I have no words to thank you. But look at the tops of those trees: from that short height the measure of us is seen to be pretty equal. Each does his work in his own way. I find so many people in different walks that can do what I cannot do. Respect is a very great thing, but I think we are in the habit of falling into a kind of delirium in regard to men who after seventy years or more have made a name. We take them as is better to make a kind of dilution, and therefore I mix a considerable amount of water with your compliments. (Laughter.) However, I thank you heartily for coming to see me. If I had the eloquence of that true Irishman, Mr. T.P. O'Connor, I should be making an impression I am only half Irish--half Irish and half Welsh--I halt therefore rather on one leg. The Welsh are admirable singers, but bad dancers. Mr. O'Connor would say not only the words most appropriate, but his language would flow on, and you would not be able to stop him. (Laughter.) I have not that gift, I can only thank you for your kindness. (Loud applause.)' Some of the visitors left their host to visit the Chalet, which, judging from its dusty appearance, now rarely received a visit from its master. This literary workshop consists of two rooms, one for work and the other for rest and refreshment. The former contained a well-selected library of English and foreign books, all exhibiting the appearance of having been well used. Brockhaus's Great Lexicon was a prominent feature in the library, which also contained first editions of several of Meredith's own books and various autograph presentation works from some of his literary friends. On the writing table there were many well-used quill pens and scraps of MS., which to the relic hunter were objects of great temptation, but reverence forbad sacrilege. Through fear of our tiring a body which Nature has made far too weak for such a mind, the pilgrimage had to be brought to an early close, so with minds stimulated and trying to hold some of the wise thoughts and expressions which had fallen from the great novelist's lips, we returned to our hotel. After the tea provided by our always practical secretary, a few short and thoughtful speeches were delivered by the Prior, Sir William Treloar and the Rev. W.J. Dawson; then, with cordial farewells and those pleasing amenities which help so much in making such outings as these doubly enjoyable, we journeyed back to the station and to town. So ended what to others beside myself will always be remembered as one of the red-letter days of our lives. Another delightful outing was to Colchester and Constable's country. There, we were not entertained with 'Oysters and Erings Roots,' but with the historical memorials for which this town and district are famous.""","""Visit to George Meredith's home""","2061","""George Meredith, the renowned Victorian novelist and poet, left an indelible mark on English literature with his works that explored love, society, and human nature.

"Higginbottom John","""II. ON THE OF OF TO. I. OF ETC. In cases of recent punctured wounds the orifice and surrounding skin should be moistened with a drop of water; the caustic should then be applied within the puncture until a little pain be felt, and then over the surrounding skin, and the eschar must be allowed to dry. In this manner it is astonishing how completely the terrible effects of a punctured wound are prevented; the eschar usually remains adherent, and the case requires no further attention. At a later period after the accident, when the caustic has been neglected, some degree of inflammation is usually present, the orifice is nearly closed with the swelling, and a little pus or fluid is formed within. A slight pressure will evacuate this fluid, the caustic may then be applied within the puncture, and over the surrounding skin, beyond the inflammation, and must be allowed to dry. In this manner we frequently succeed in forming an adherent eschar, and all inflammation subsides. Any slight vesication which may be raised around punctured wounds is not of the same consequence as when an adherent eschar is wished to be formed over a sore or ulcer; one or more small punctures may be made to evacuate the fluid and the part may be allowed to dry. If there is reason to think that an abscess has actually formed under the puncture to any extent, it must be opened freely by a lancet and treated with caustic and poultice, keeping the poultice moist and cold with water. In cases of puncture where the orifice is healed and where an erysipelatous inflammation is spreading, attended with swelling, I have applied the caustic freely over and beyond the inflamed parts, and I have had the satisfaction to find that the inflammation has been arrested in its progress and has shortly subsided. This mode of treatment is particularly useful in cases of punctured and lacerated wounds from various instruments, such as needles, nails, hooks, bayonets, saws, &c. and in the bites of animals, leech-bites, stings of insects, &c. In considerable lacerations the same objection would exist to this treatment as in large ulcers. The dreadful effects of punctures from needles, scratches from bone, or other injuries received in dissection, are totally prevented by this treatment. I have for the last five years had frequent opportunities of trying it in these cases and have the most perfect confidence in its success. The advantage of these modes of treating punctured wounds will however be best explained and established by a selection of cases, to which I can add particular remarks as they may be suggested by peculiarities in the cases themselves. CASE I. A.B. received a severe punctured wound by a hook of the size of a crow-quill, which pierced into the flesh between the thumb and fore-finger on the outside of the hand; scarcely a drop of blood followed, but there was immediately severe pain and tumefaction. The lunar caustic was applied without loss of time, deep within the orifice and around the edge of the wound; and the eschar was left to dry. The smarting pain induced by the caustic was severe for a time but gradually subsided. On the ensuing day, the eschar was adherent and there was little pain; but there was more swelling than usual after the prompt application of the caustic, owing to the mobility of the part. On the third day the swelling remained as before, and there was a little sense of heat. On the fourth day the swelling and heat had subsided, and the eschar remained adherent. On the succeeding day the eschar had been removed by washing the hand, and the puncture was unhealed but free from pain and irritation. The caustic was reapplied. From this time the eschar remained adherent, and at length gradually separated leaving the part perfectly well. It is quite certain that under any other mode of treatment this severe puncture would have greatly inflamed and have proved very painful and troublesome; and it is not improbable but that suppuration and much suffering might have ensued. All this is effectually and almost certainly prevented if the caustic be applied promptly, as in this case. When time has been lost, the case is very different as will appear hereafter; but even in these cases, the caustic proves an invaluable application. CASE II. Mrs. Middleton, aged 0, wounded her wrist, on the ulnar side, by the hook of a door post; there was a considerable flow of blood at first, but this ceased suddenly and the arm immediately became affected with great pain and swelling. The lunar caustic was applied in half an hour after the accident. On the following day the eschar was observed to be adherent, and the patient reported that she had suffered scarcely any pain, after the smarting of the caustic had ceased. There was a slight swelling round the puncture but that of the arm had totally subsided. The caustic was applied over and beyond the swelling. On the third day all tumefaction had subsided and there was no complaint whatever. I hoped that this case would have required no further attention or remedy. But my patient contrived unfortunately to rub off the eschar about a week after its formation, and so to expose the subjacent wound unhealed; she suffered however no pain or inconvenience from it; and it was again shielded by means of a fresh eschar, which remained adherent until removed by the healing process underneath. This puncture was so severe that the arm was in a state of ecchymosis for six or eight inches upwards, and I doubt not that without the caustic, there would have been severe and long continued suffering, and perhaps painful suppurations. CASE III. A female servant punctured the end of the finger by a pin; there succeeded much pain and swelling, and it appeared that the nail would separate, and the cuticle all round the finger was raised by the effusion of fluid. This fluid was evacuated and a poultice applied. On the third day the cuticle was removed, and the exposed surface was found to be ulcerated in several spots. The lunar caustic was passed slightly over the excoriated surface, which was then left exposed to dry. On the succeeding day the eschar was adherent and the pain had almost subsided. On the next day, the eschar still remained adherent, and as there was neither pain nor soreness, the patient used her finger. The eschar was at length removed by the healing process and was separated together with the nail, and the case was unattended by any further inconvenience or trouble either to the patient or myself. It is scarcely necessary to contrast the advantage of this mode of treatment with that by plasters, poultices, &c. It is at once more speedy and secure, and less cumbersome to such patients as are obliged to continue domestic avocations. CASE IV. The present case is somewhat more severe than those which have been already given, and what is of great importance, the caustic was not applied immediately after the accident. William Chantry, aged 0, received a stab in the wrist with a hay-fork yesterday and applied a poultice; to-day there are great pain and swelling, and the wounded orifice is very small. I applied the lunar caustic within the puncture, and directly a cold poultice to be worn over it; the arm was kept in a sling. The next day the swelling and pain were diminished, and a little lymph flowed from the wound. I again applied the caustic and continued the poultice. Two days afterwards, the swelling and pain were nearly gone. The poultice was merely continued, the caustic not being requisite from the subsidence of the inflammation. The patient came to me again in four days more quite free from pain and swelling. The poultice was discontinued, and the caustic was then applied in order to form an adherent eschar, in which I was successful. This case illustrates many important points;. it shows the efficacy of the caustic with the poultice as a remedy against inflammation;. it presents an instance of a labouring man returning to work on the sixth or seventh day after a severe accident, even when the application of the caustic had been unfortunately delayed;. it points out the proper treatment, when all hope of the treatment from the first by adherent eschar is lost from such delay,--for had this been attempted in this case, suppuration would doubtless have taken place from the closed state of the puncture by the swelling;--our objects must therefore be, to open the puncture and to subdue the inflammation, and these objects are admirably attained by means of the caustic. The following case is not less instructive. CASE V. Mr. Cocking's son, aged 2, received a stab in the palm of the hand from a penknife three days ago, which has been followed by much swelling and pain, the punctured orifice being nearly closed. I applied the lunar caustic as deep as possible within the puncture and directed a cold poultice to be laid over the whole hand. On the next day I found that the poultice had not been applied; there were more pain and swelling; an eschar was formed over the puncture which I removed and thus gave issue to a considerable quantity of pus; I again enjoined the application of a cold poultice kept constantly moist and cold with water. On the succeeding day, the inflammation had greatly subsided. I repeated the application of the caustic and poultice. On the fourth day the inflammation had nearly disappeared and on the fifth entirely. In such cases the caustic unites the advantages of at once opening the puncture and of subduing the inflammation, thus preventing the formation of deep-seated abscesses. CASE VI. A little boy, aged 2, received a stab by a penknife a few days ago, in the fore part of the thigh; there are now great pain and swelling, the orifice is nearly closed, and he has feverishness with headach.""","""Punctured wound treatment techniques""","2125","""Punctured wounds are injuries caused by a sharp object penetrating through the skin and potentially deeper into the body. These wounds can vary in severity, from superficial pricks to deep penetrations that may damage internal organs. Proper treatment of punctured wounds is crucial to prevent infection, promote healing, and reduce the risk of complications. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore various techniques for the treatment of punctured wounds, ranging from initial first aid to medical intervention.  The first step in treating a punctured wound is to assess the severity of the injury. For minor wounds that do not penetrate deeply and do not involve significant bleeding, first aid measures can be sufficient. However, for deeper or more extensive puncture wounds, seeking medical attention is essential to ensure proper evaluation and treatment.  For minor punctured wounds, the following steps can be taken at home or in an emergency situation:  1. **Clean the Wound:** Rinse the wound with clean water to remove any debris or contamination. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or alcohol as they can damage the tissues.  2. **Control Bleeding:** Apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or sterile gauze to stop any bleeding. Elevate the wound above the heart if possible to help reduce blood flow.  3. **Apply Antiseptic:** After thoroughly cleaning the wound, apply an over-the-counter antiseptic ointment to reduce the risk of infection. This step is especially crucial for punctured wounds that may introduce bacteria deep into the tissues.  4. **Cover the Wound:** Use a sterile adhesive bandage or dressing to protect the wound from further contamination. Change the dressing regularly to keep the wound clean and dry.  5. **Monitor for Signs of Infection:** Watch for symptoms such as increased pain, swelling, redness, warmth around the wound, or the presence of pus. If these occur, seek medical attention promptly.  For deep or severe puncture wounds, professional medical treatment is necessary. In these cases, the following techniques may be employed by healthcare providers:  1. **Wound Irrigation:** The wound is cleaned and flushed with a sterile saline solution to remove any foreign material, bacteria, or debris. This helps reduce the risk of infection and promotes healing.  2. **Debridement:** In cases where the punctured wound is contaminated or if there is dead tissue present, debridement may be necessary. This involves removing damaged or infected tissue to prevent complications.  3. **Antibiotics:** Depending on the severity and location of the puncture wound, antibiotics may be prescribed to prevent or treat infection. It is essential to complete the full course of antibiotics as directed by the healthcare provider.  4. **Tetanus Vaccination:** If the punctured wound is deep or if the individual's tetanus vaccination status is not up to date, a tetanus booster may be administered to prevent tetanus infection.  5. **Sutures or Closure:** In some cases, deep puncture wounds may require sutures or closure to promote proper healing and reduce scarring. Healthcare providers will assess the wound and determine the appropriate method of closure.  In addition to these treatment techniques, certain precautions and considerations can help in the management of punctured wounds:  1. **Pain Management:** Over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage pain and discomfort associated with punctured wounds. Follow the instructions on the medication label or consult a healthcare provider for guidance.  2. **Follow-Up Care:** It is essential to follow up with a healthcare provider for ongoing wound care, especially for deep or infected puncture wounds. They can monitor the healing process and address any concerns that may arise.  3. **Wound Healing:** Keep the punctured wound clean and dry to facilitate healing. Avoid exposing the wound to contaminants or excessive moisture, which can impede the healing process.  4. **Seek Medical Attention:** If a puncture wound shows signs of infection, such as increasing pain, redness, swelling, or drainage of pus, seek medical attention promptly. Infections in punctured wounds can lead to serious complications if left untreated.  Overall, prompt and appropriate treatment of punctured wounds is crucial to prevent infection, promote healing, and minimize the risk of complications. By following these treatment techniques and precautions, individuals can effectively manage puncture wounds and support the recovery process. Remember, when in doubt about the severity of a puncture wound, seeking medical evaluation and care is always the best course of action for optimal outcomes and peace of mind.""","901"
"Snell F J  Frederick John ","""Allusion has been made to the ring as the symbol of the spiritual espousal. As such it was the object of peculiar reverence, and its destination was frequently specified in the vowess's will. Thus in 'Testamenta Vetusta' we find the abstract of the will of Alice, widow of Sir Thomas West, dated 395/8, in which the lady bequeaths 'the ring with which I was spoused to God' to her son Sir Thomas. In like manner Katherine Riplingham leaves a gold ring set with a diamond--the ring with which she was sacred--to her daughter Alice Saint John. To some vowesses the custody even of a son or daughter appeared unworthy of so precious a relic; and thus we learn that Lady Joan Danvers, by her will dated 45/83, gave her spousal ring to the image of the Crucifix near the north door of St. Paul's, while Lady Margaret Davy presented hers to the image of Our Lady of Walsingham. In certain instances the formality of episcopal benediction was dispensed with, a simple promise sufficing. As a case in point, John Brackenbury, by his will dated 487, bequeathed to his mother certain real estate subject to the condition that she did not marry again--a condition to which she assented before the parson and parish of Thymmylbe. 'If,' says the testator, 'she keep not that promise, I will that she be content with that which was my father's will, which she had every penny.' But, in compacts or wills in which the married parties themselves were interested, the vow seems to have been usually exacted. Wives sometimes engaged with their husbands to make the vow; and the will of William Herbert, Knight, Earl of Pembroke, dated July 7, 469, contains an affecting reminder of duty--'And, wife, that you may remember your promise to take the order of widowhood, so that you may be the better maistres of your owen, to perform my will, and to help my children, as I love and trust you,' etc. Husbands left chattels to their wives provided that they took the vow of chastity. The will of Sir Gilbert Denys, Knight, of Syston, dated 422, sets out: 'If Margaret, my wife, will after my death vow a vow of chastity, I give her all my moveable goods, she paying my debts and providing for my children; and if she will not vow the vow of chastity, I desire my goods may be divided and distributed in three equal parts.' On like terms wives were appointed executrices. William Edlington, Esq., of Castle Carlton, in his will dated June 1, 466, declares: 'I make Christian, my wife, my sole executor on this condition, that she take the mantle soon after my decease; and in case she will not take the mantle and the ring, I will that William my son be my executors, and she to have a third part of all my goods moveable.' Such is the frailty of human nature that even when widows accepted the obligation of faith and chastity in the most solemn manner, the vow was occasionally broken. This will hardly excite surprise when we consider the youth, or comparative youth, of some of the postulants. Mary, the widow of Lewis, King of Hungary, was only twenty-three at the time of her profession. Our English annals yield striking instances of promises followed by repentance. Thus Eleanor, third daughter of King John, 'on the death of her first husband, the Earl of Pembroke, 231, in the first transports of her grief, made in public a solemn vow in the presence of Edmund, Archbishop of Canterbury, that she would never again become a wife, but remain a true spouse of Christ, and received a ring in confirmation, which she, however, broke, much to the indignation of a strong party of the laity and clergy of England, on her marriage with Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester.' Another delinquent was Lady Elizabeth Juliers, Countess of Kent. When her first husband died, in 35/84, she took a vow of chastity before William de Edyndon, Archbishop of Canterbury. Six years later she was wedded privately and without licence to Sir Eustace Dabridgecourt, Knight. As the result, the Archbishop of Canterbury instituted proceedings against her, and she was condemned to severe penance for the remainder of her life. In the light of these examples it is unnecessary to observe that the infraction of a vow so strict and stringent brought the utmost discredit on any widow who might be guilty of it. The question has been raised why widows did not, instead of making their especial vow, enter the third orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis, both of them intended for pious persons remaining in the world. The answer has already, in some degree, been given in what was said regarding the extinct order of deaconesses. Followers of St. Dominic and St. Francis were bound to recite daily a shortened form of the Breviary, supposing that they were able to read, or, if they were not able, a certain number of Aves and Paternosters. They were further expected to observe sundry fasts over and above those commanded by the Church, and thus they became qualified for all the benefits accruing to the first two orders, Dominican and Franciscan. With the vowesses it was different. The one condition imposed upon them was that of chastity, as tending to a state of sanctification. They took upon themselves no other obligation whatever, and consequently acquired no title to the blessings and privileges flowing from the strict observance of rules to which they did not subscribe. Even after the Reformation the custom did not absolutely cease. At any rate, Anne Clifford, Countess of Dorset, who died in 676, is stated, after the death of her last husband, to have dressed in black serge and to have been very abstemious in the matter of food. Here and there may be found funeral monuments containing representations of vowesses. Leland remarks, with reference to a member of the Marmion family at West Tanfield, Yorkshire: 'There lyeth there alone a lady with the apparill of a vowess'; and in Norfolk there are still in existence two brasses of widows and vowesses. The earlier and smaller, of about the year 5/800, adjoins the threshold of the west door of Witton church, near Blofield, and bears the figure of a lady in a gown, mantle, barbe or gorget, and veil, together with the inscription: DEUS. The other example is in the little church of Frenze, near Diss, which contains, among a number of other interesting brasses, that of a lady clothed, like the former, in gown, mantle, barbe, and veil. This figure, however, shows cuffs; the gown is encircled with an ornamental girdle, and depending from the mantle on long cords ending in tassels. Underneath runs the legend: HIC AC DEO. OLIM QUI OBIT DIE ANNO CU JUS DEUS. AMEN. Below are three shields, of which the dexter bears the husband's arms, the sinister those of Dame Braham's family, and the middle the coats impaled. In neither of these examples is the ring--the most important symbol--displayed on the vowess's finger. This omission may be explained, perhaps, by the fact that it was not buried with her, being, as we have seen, sometimes bequeathed as an heirloom and sometimes left as a gift to the Church. Notwithstanding the desire of so many husbands that their widows should live 'sole, without marriage,' it is well known that second and even third marriages were not uncommon in the Middle Ages, and, provided that they did not involve an infraction of some solemn engagement, do not appear to have incurred social censure any more than at present. III THE LADY FAST It was pointed out as one of the distinctions between vowesses and members of the third orders of the Dominican and Franciscan brotherhoods that the latter were pledged to the observance of fasts from which the former were exempt. Tyndale complains of the 'open idolatry' of abstinences undertaken in honour of St. Patrick, St. Brandan, and other holy men of old; and he lays special stress on 'Our Lady Fast,' which, he explains, was kept 'either seven years the same day that her day falleth in March, and then begin, or one year with bread and water.' Whatever fasts a vowess might neglect as non-obligatory, it seems probable that she would not willingly forgo any opportunity of showing reverence to the Blessed Virgin, who, in the belief of St. Augustine, had taken vows of chastity before the salutation of the Angel. It is not a little curious that the Lady Fast, in the forms mentioned by Tyndale, was so far from being enjoined by the Church as to be actually opposed to the decree of the Roman Council of 078, which indicated Saturday as the day of the week appropriated to the honour of the Blessed Virgin. This usage was as well understood in the British Isles as elsewhere. Thus, in 'Piers Plowman': Lechery said 'Alas!' and on Our Lady he cried To make mercy for his misdeeds between God and his soul, With that he should the Saturday seven year thereafter Drink but with the duck, and dine but once. Bower, the continuator of Fordun's 'Scotichronicon,' makes it a reproach to lax prelates that they suffer the common people to vary after their own pleasure the days kept as fast days in honour of Mary. In doing so he recalls that on Saturday, the first Easter Eve, she abode unshakenly in the faith, when the apostles doubted. Good reason, therefore, why Saturday should be dedicated to her as a fast. 'But now,' he continues, 'you will see both men and women on a Saturday morning make good dinners, who, on a Tuesday or a Thursday, would not touch a crust of bread, lest they should break the Lady Fast kept after their own fancy.'""","""Widows' vows and spiritual symbols""","2173","""In many cultures and religions around the world, widows have unique roles and responsibilities along with specific customs and practices that set them apart. One of the significant aspects of being a widow in certain traditions is the concept of """"widows' vows."""" These vows hold deep spiritual and symbolic significance, often serving as a way for widows to navigate their grief, honor their spouses, and redefine their own identities and roles within their communities.  Widows' vows are promises or commitments made by widows in the aftermath of their spouse's death. These vows vary widely across different cultures and belief systems, reflecting the diversity and richness of human experiences. While some widows' vows may be formalized through religious ceremonies or rituals, others are more personal and introspective, serving as a private declaration of intent to honor their late partners and embark on a new chapter of their lives.  In Hinduism, for example, widows may undertake vows such as """"Sati,"""" where a widow immolates herself on her husband's funeral pyre, or """"Savitri,"""" a vow of lifelong fidelity and devotion to her late husband's memory. These vows are rooted in ancient traditions and beliefs, serving as a way to uphold the sanctity of marriage and demonstrate unwavering loyalty even in the face of loss.  Similarly, in Christian traditions, widows may take vows of chastity or service to the church as a way of dedicating their lives to God following their spouse's death. These vows symbolize a spiritual commitment to living a life of piety and service, often within religious communities that provide support and guidance during times of mourning and transition.  Beyond the realm of formalized vows, widows also often encounter various spiritual symbols that hold personal and cultural significance during their grieving process. These symbols can offer comfort, hope, and a sense of connection to something greater than themselves, helping widows navigate the complex emotions and challenges that come with loss.  One of the most ubiquitous symbols associated with widowhood is the black attire traditionally worn to signify mourning in many societies. The color black is often seen as a symbol of grief, solemnity, and respect for the deceased, serving as a visual representation of the widow's mourning process.  In addition to attire, various objects and symbols carry spiritual meaning for widows across different cultures. For example, the lotus flower is a powerful symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing purity, enlightenment, and spiritual growth. Widows may find solace in the symbolism of the lotus flower as they navigate their grief and seek spiritual renewal in the wake of loss.  Similarly, the butterfly is a widely recognized symbol of transformation and rebirth in many cultures. For widows, the image of a butterfly emerging from a cocoon can serve as a poignant reminder of the possibility of renewal and growth even in the face of profound loss and upheaval.  Another common symbol associated with widowhood is the candle, which represents light in the darkness and serves as a beacon of hope and remembrance. Lighting candles in memory of a late spouse or during moments of reflection and prayer can provide widows with a sense of comfort and connection to their loved ones beyond the physical realm.  Ultimately, widows' vows and spiritual symbols play a crucial role in the lives of widows, offering them guidance, solace, and a sense of purpose as they navigate the journey of grief and healing. Whether formalized through vows or embodied in symbolic gestures and objects, these elements serve as powerful reminders of the enduring love, strength, and resilience of widows in the face of loss.""","717"
"Thorpe Francis Newton","""It is a matter purely voluntary on the part of those who avail themselves of the opportunity, and the Legislature may or may not continue the law at discretion, as a matter of public policy. 3. The execution of an office to which a person has been lawfully elected, or appointed, by the performance, by him, of its duties, is a completed contract, with perfect obligation to pay for services rendered at the rate of compensation fixed by the contract, and this obligation can no more be impaired by a law of the State than that arising on a promissory note. 4. The charters of private charitable institutions are contracts within the letter of the Constitution, and their obligation cannot be impaired without violating it. But if a charter to a corporation, for example a railroad, or a college, provides for possible alteration or amendment by the Legislature of the State, such power of alteration duly exercised by a later Legislature is not unconstitutional as impairing the obligation of a contract. 5/8. The police power of the State extends to the protection of the lives, health, and property of citizens, and to the preservation of good order and the public morals, nor can the Legislature, by any contract, divest itself of the power to provide for these objects. They belong emphatically to that class of objects which demand the application of the maxim, salus populi suprema lex; and they are to be attained and provided for by such appropriate means as the legislative discretion may devise. That discretion can no more be bargained away than the power itself. In exercise of this police power the Legislature prohibits the manufacture and sale of malt liquor. Such manufacture or sale is not an exercise of a right by contract, and prohibition of the business is not legislation impairing the obligation of a contract. So too, a provision in a State constitution forbidding lotteries and gift enterprises within a commonwealth, and revoking lottery charters theretofore granted, is not a law impairing the obligation of a contract. The principle followed here is expressed by the Chief Justice (Waite): No legislature can bargain away the public health or the public morals. Thus it may be accepted as settled constitutional law that the people in their sovereign capacity and through their properly constituted agencies may exercise powers as the public good may require. But corporations and private persons possessing and exercising rights and franchises vested in them by law and possessing property rights by contract are entitled to compensation when, under the State power of eminent domain, such vested rights are taken away. 6. Whether property or employment possesses the qualities or attributes of a public use will largely determine the character of legislative control for the purpose of safe-guarding the public against danger, injustice, and oppression; the police power of the State is here paramount. 7. The principle involved in the obligation of contracts is clearly set forth by the Supreme Court: In placing the obligation of contracts under the protection of the Constitution, its framers looked to the essentials of the contract more than to the forms and modes of proceeding by which it was to be carried out into execution; annulling State legislation which impaired the obligation, it was left to the States to prescribe and shape the remedy to enforce it. The obligation of a contract consists in its binding force on the party who makes it. This depends on the laws in existence when it is made; these are necessarily referred to in all contracts and forming a part of them as the measure of the obligation to perform them by the one party, and the right acquired by the other. There can be no other standard by which to ascertain the extent of either, than that which the terms of the contract indicate according to their settled legal meaning; when it becomes consummated, the law defines the duty and the right, compels one party to perform the thing contracted for, and gives the other a right to enforce the performance by the remedies then in force. If any subsequent law affect to diminish the duty, or to impair the right, it necessarily bears on the obligation of the contract, in favor of one party, to the injury of the other; hence, any law which, in its operation, amounts to a denial, or obstruction, of the rights accruing by a contract, though professing to act only on the remedy, is directly obnoxious to the prohibition of the Constitution. 8. The prohibition of legislation impairing the obligation of contracts does not extend to the United States as it does to the States. Thus in the Legal Tender Cases and in sundry bankruptcy cases. the Supreme Court has decided that the exercise of the power of Congress does not depend upon the incidental effect of its exercise on contracts, but on the existence of the power itself. This means that the United States possesses a police power, salus populi suprema lex, in exercise of which at the discretion of Congress, the obligation of contracts must yield to the higher obligation of the general welfare. 9. It is a fundamental of government in America that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without compensation. The prohibition and protection as to due process of law extends both to the United States and to the States. The taking by a State of the private property of a person, and a corporation is legally a person, without the owners consent, for the private use of another is not due process of law, and it violates the Fourteenth Amendment. A State possesses exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over persons and property within its territory and consequently may determine for itself the civil status and capacities of its inhabitants; may prescribe the subjects upon which they may contract, and regulate the manner and conditions upon which property situated within its territory or jurisdiction may be acquired, enjoyed, and transferred; but no State can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over persons or property without its jurisdiction. The laws of a State have no operation outside its territory except so far as is allowed by comity; any exertion of authority by a State beyond its territory is a nullity. The sovereign power of the State over property within its jurisdiction, belonging to non-residents is exercisable as over the property of residents. But the property right of the non-resident cannot be invalidated save by due process of law, which means, inter alia, the right of the non-resident to appear personally, or by representative, in the courts of the State to protect his own interests. A State law under which a nonresidents property should be taken without such notice would be unconstitutional by the Fourteenth Amendment. But the Fourteenth Amendment does not deprive the States of their police power over subjects within their jurisdiction. 0. The right of eminent domain is essentially of the police power, and for State purposes is exclusively within the State. Each State in the Union regulates its domestic commerce, contracts, the transmission of estates, real and personal and acts upon all internal matters which relate to its moral and political welfare. Over these subjects the federal government has no power. The acknowledged police power of a State extends often to the destruction of property. A nuisance may be abated. Thus a State constitution, or a statute under it, prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, except for medicinal, scientific, and mechanical purposes, does not conflict with the clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which provides that no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. The so-called right to manufacture or sell such articles is not a right growing out of citizenship of the United States. Such manufacture or sale, or its prohibition is wholly within the power of the State to control. Such control is of wholly internal affairs. The right to manufacture or sell such articles is not a right under a contract as the word contract is used in the Constitution. Prohibition of the manufacture and sale of such articles, save as excepted, does not deprive the citizen of his constitutional rights. Such prohibition is the policy of the supreme power in the State and is an exercise of a function within its jurisdiction. The exercise of the police power of the State by the destruction of property which is itself a public nuisance, or the prohibition of its use in a particular way whereby its value becomes depreciated, is very different from taking property for public use, or from depriving a person of his property without due process of law. In one case, a nuisance only is abated; in the other, unoffending property is taken away from an innocent owner. 1. The provision of the Constitution that private property shall not be taken for public use without compensation is a limitation on the power of the federal government, and not on the States, but the State constitutions usually include the limitation in their Bills of Rights: the principle is essentially a part of American constitutional law. 2.""","""Contractual obligations and state power""","1815","""Contractual obligations and state power play significant roles in shaping legal, economic, and social landscapes. Contracts form the cornerstone of transactions in various spheres, from business agreements to personal arrangements. These agreements involve promises and commitments between parties, legally binding them to fulfill specific duties or obligations. On the other hand, state power refers to the authority wielded by governments to regulate, enforce laws, and maintain order within their territories. The interaction between contractual obligations and state power is intricate, as the state often intervenes in contractual matters to ensure fairness, equity, and compliance with legal standards.  At its core, a contract is a voluntary agreement between two or more parties, outlining the terms and conditions of their relationship. These terms can cover a wide range of issues, such as payment schedules, delivery timelines, quality standards, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Contracts are essential for fostering trust, clarity, and accountability in relationships, whether between individuals, businesses, or governments. They provide a framework for parties to negotiate and formalize their intentions, minimizing misunderstandings and potential conflicts. Enforcing contractual obligations is crucial for upholding the integrity of agreements and protecting the interests of the parties involved.  State power comes into play concerning contractual obligations through the legal system and regulatory frameworks. Governments enact laws and regulations that govern the formation, performance, and enforcement of contracts. These laws serve to define the rights and responsibilities of parties, set standards for fairness and transparency, and provide remedies in case of breaches or disputes. State intervention in contractual matters aims to create a level playing field, prevent exploitation, and ensure that agreements are conducted in accordance with ethical and legal norms. By overseeing contracts, the state acts as a safeguard against fraud, coercion, and unfair practices that may undermine the integrity of agreements.  Furthermore, state power extends to the enforcement of contractual obligations through judicial systems and administrative bodies. When parties fail to honor their commitments, the state has the authority to intervene and compel compliance. This enforcement mechanism reinforces the sanctity of contracts and upholds the rule of law. Courts play a crucial role in interpreting contractual terms, resolving conflicts, and providing remedies such as damages, specific performance, or injunctions. Through legal proceedings, the state ensures that parties adhere to their obligations and that justice is served in cases of breach or non-performance.  In some cases, state power may limit the freedom of contract to protect public interests or address societal concerns. For instance, certain types of contracts may be deemed unlawful or against public policy, such as agreements that promote discrimination, exploitation, or harm to the environment. Governments may also intervene in contracts that involve essential services like healthcare, utilities, or infrastructure to prevent monopolies, ensure affordability, and uphold standards of quality and accessibility. State regulations may impose restrictions on contractual terms, pricing, or conditions to safeguard consumer rights, promote competition, or advance public welfare.  The interplay between contractual obligations and state power raises complex issues regarding autonomy, authority, and justice. While contracts embody the principles of freedom of choice and private ordering, state intervention is necessary to maintain order, protect vulnerable parties, and uphold collective interests. Balancing these interests requires a delicate approach that acknowledges the dynamics of power, accountability, and social responsibility. Contract law evolves to adapt to changing societal values, economic dynamics, and technological advancements, reflecting the ongoing dialogue between private autonomy and public regulation.  In conclusion, contractual obligations and state power intersect in multifaceted ways that influence legal, economic, and social dimensions. Contracts serve as the building blocks of relationships and transactions, while state power ensures compliance, fairness, and justice in contractual matters. The state's role in overseeing contracts is essential to prevent abuses, resolve disputes, and uphold public welfare. By navigating the complexities of contractual obligations and state power, societies can foster trust, accountability, and ethical conduct in their interactions, laying the foundation for a harmonious and equitable legal framework.""","774"
"Atwood Wallace Walter","""Locally the body of drift was so great that valleys were completely filled, and therefore completely obliterated as surface features. Less frequently, drift not only filled the valleys but rose even higher over their former positions than on either side. In other places the greater depths of drift, instead of being deposited in the valleys, were left on pre-glacial elevations, building them up to still greater heights. In short, the mantle of drift of unequal thickness was laid down upon the rock surface in such a manner that the thicker parts sometimes rest on hills and ridges, sometimes on slopes, sometimes on plains, and sometimes in valleys. These relations are suggested by Figs. 2 and 3. From them it will be seen that in regions where the thickness of the drift is great, relative to the relief of the underlying rock, the topography may be completely changed. Not only may some of the valleys be obliterated by being filled, but some of the hills may be obliterated by having the lower land between them built up to their level. In regions where the thickness of the drift is slight, relative to the relief of the rock beneath, the hills cannot be buried, and the valleys cannot be completely filled, so that the relative positions of the principal topographic features will remain much the same after the deposition of the drift, as. In these depressions water may collect, forming lakes or ponds, or in some cases only marshes and bogs. OF ICE. The direction in which glacier ice moved may be determined in various ways, even after the ice has disappeared. The shapes of the rock hills over which the ice passed, the direction from which the materials of the drift came, and the course of the margin of the drift, all show that the ice of south central Wisconsin was moving in a general southwest direction. In the rock hills, this is shown by the greater wear of their (Plate ). From the course of the drift margin, the general direction of movement may be inferred when it is remembered that the tendency of glacier ice on a plane surface is to move at right angles to its margin. For the exact determination of the direction of ice movement, recourse must be had to the stri on the bed-rock. Were the striated rock surface perfectly plane, and were the stri even lines, they would only tell that the ice was moving in one of two directions. But the rock surface is not usually perfectly plane, nor the stri even lines, and between the two directions which lines alone might suggest, it is usually possible to decide. The minor prominences and depressions in the rock surface were shaped according to the same principles that govern the shaping of stage when the ridge or hill acts as a wedge, dividing the moving ice into lobes, Fig. 4; the nunatak stage, when the ice has pushed forward and reunited beyond the hill, Fig. 5/8; the stage when the ice has become sufficiently deep to cover the hill. After the ice has disappeared, the influence of the obstruction might be found in the disposition of the drift. If recession began during the first stage, that is, when the ice edge was separated into lobes, the margin of the drift should be lobate, and would loop back around the ridge from its advanced position on either side. If recession began during the second stage, that is, when the lobes had become confluent and completely surrounded the hill, a driftless area would appear in the midst of drift. If recession began during the third stage, that is, after the ice had moved on over the obstruction, the evidence of the sequence might be obliterated; but if the ice moved but a short distance beyond the hill, the thinner ice over the hill would have advanced less far than the thicker ice on either side (Fig. 5/8), and the margin of the drift would show a re-entrant pointing back toward the hill, though not reaching it. All these conditions are illustrated in the Devil's lake region. Limit of the Ice. The region under description is partly covered with drift, and partly free from it. The limit of the ice, at the time of its maximum expansion is well defined at many points, and the nature and position of the drift limit are so unique as to merit attention (see Plates II and ). They illustrate many of the principles already discussed. The ice which covered the region was the western margin of the Green Bay the last continental ice sheet. Its limit in this region is marked by a ridge-like accumulation of drift, the terminal moraine, which here has a general north-south direction. The region may have been affected by the ice of more than one epoch, but since the ice of the last epoch advanced as far to the west in this region as that of any earlier epoch, the moraine is on the border between the glaciated country to the east, and the driftless area to the the Devil's nose (Plate ), again illustrating the fact that lowlands favor ice advance. The valley between the Devil's nose and the East bluff is a narrow one, and the ice advanced through it nearly to the present site of the lake.""","""Glacial Drift and Topography Changes""","1040","""Glacial drift, a significant geological process, plays a crucial role in shaping the Earth's topography over long periods. As glaciers move, they carry a wide array of sediments such as rocks, boulders, sand, and clay, collectively known as glacial drift. During the process, glaciers act as enormous bulldozers, picking up vast amounts of material and transporting them across vast distances. These materials are then deposited when the ice melts, leading to the formation of distinct landforms and altering the topography of the region.  There are two main types of glacial drift: till and stratified drift. Till is unsorted material directly deposited by the glacier as it recedes or melts, while stratified drift occurs when glacial meltwater transports and deposits sediment in distinct layers. Both types of drift play a critical role in modifying landscapes and creating unique geological features like moraines, eskers, and drumlins.  Moraines are ridges of till deposited along the edges or in the middle of a glacier. Terminal moraines mark the furthest advance of a glacier, while lateral moraines form along the sides. Moreover, medial moraines are created when two glaciers merge, combining their lateral moraines. These features provide valuable insights into past glacial movements and help scientists reconstruct the history of glacial advances and retreats.  Eskers are long, winding ridges composed of stratified drift deposited by meltwater streams flowing within or below the glacier. These formations can stretch for miles and offer evidence of subglacial meltwater channels. Drumlins, on the other hand, are elongated hills or mounds of till that are streamlined in the direction of past glacier movement. These teardrop-shaped landforms indicate the flow direction of glaciers and can often be found clustered together in groups called drumlin fields.  Glacial drift not only creates unique landforms but also influences soil composition and fertility. The deposition of various sediments results in a diverse range of soil types with differing properties. For instance, till-rich soils tend to be fertile and supportive of agriculture, while sandy or gravelly deposits may be less suitable for farming. Understanding the distribution of glacial drift and its impact on soil characteristics is essential for land use planning, resource management, and environmental conservation efforts.  Furthermore, the presence of glacial drift can affect water drainage patterns and groundwater recharge rates. The permeability of glacial deposits influences how water moves through the subsurface, leading to the formation of aquifers and affecting surface water flows. By studying glacial drift and its hydrological implications, scientists and policymakers can better manage water resources, mitigate flooding risks, and protect ecosystems that rely on a balanced water supply.  In addition to its geological and environmental significance, glacial drift has played a crucial role in shaping human history and development. The presence of glacial deposits has influenced settlement patterns, agriculture, and infrastructure planning in regions affected by glaciation. For example, the rich soils left behind by retreating glaciers have enabled agricultural productivity in areas such as the Midwest United States and Northern Europe.  Overall, glacial drift is a dynamic process that continues to shape landscapes and impact ecosystems around the world. By studying glacial deposits and their associated landforms, scientists gain valuable insights into Earth's past climate variations, ice age dynamics, and the long-term evolution of topographic features. Understanding the intricate relationship between glacial drift and topography changes is essential for unraveling the geological history of our planet and informing future land management practices.""","703"
"Dubnow Simon","""He failed to perceive, as did also some of his like-minded contemporaries, that the culture which the Russian Government of his time was trying to foist upon the Jews was only apt to accentuate their distrust, that, so long as they were the target of persecution, the Jews could not possibly accept the gift of enlightenment from the hands of those who lured them to the baptismal font, pushed their children on the path of religious treason, and were ruthless in breaking and disfiguring their whole mode of life. In his literary works Levinsohn was fond of emphasizing his relations with high Government officials. This probably saved him from a great deal of unpleasantness on the part of the fanatic Hasidim, but it also had the effect of increasing his unpopularity among the orthodox. The only merit the latter were willing to concede to Levinsohn was that of an apologist who defended Judaism against the attacks of non-Jews. During the epidemic of ritual murder trials, the rabbis of Lithuania and Volhynia addressed a request to Levinsohn to write a book against this horrid libel. At their suggestion he published his work Efes Damim, 'No Blood!' (Vilna, 837), in the form of a dialogue between a Jewish sage and a Greek-Orthodox patriarch in Jerusalem. Somewhat later Levinsohn wrote other apologetic treatises, defending the Talmud against the attacks contained in the book Netibot 'Olam published in 839 by the London missionary M'Caul. Levinsohn's great apologetic work Zerubbabel, which appeared several years after his death, was equally dedicated to the defence of the Talmud. It has, moreover, considerable scientific merit, being one of the first research works in the domain of talmudic theology. A number of other publications by Levinsohn deal with Hebrew philology and lexicography. All these efforts support Levinsohn's claim to the title of Founder of a modern Jewish Science in Russia, though his scholarly achievements cannot be classed with those of his German and Galician fellow-writers, such as Rapoport, Zunz, Jost and Geiger. Levinsohn stood entirely aloof from the propaganda of bureaucratic enlightenment which was carried on by Lilienthal in the name of Uvarov. The Volhynian hermit was completely overshadowed by the energetic young German. Even when Lilienthal, after realizing that a union between Jewish culture and Russian officialdom was altogether unnatural, had disappeared from the stage, Levinsohn still persisted in cultivating his relations with the Government. But by that time the bureaucrats of St. Petersburg had no more use for the Jewish friends of enlightenment. Broken in health, chained to his bed for half a lifetime, without means of subsistence, lonely amidst a hostile orthodox environment, Levinsohn time and again addressed to St. Petersburg humiliating appeals for monetary assistance, occasionally receiving small pittances, which were booked under the heading 'Relief in Distress,' accepted subventions from various Jewish Mcenases, and remained a pauper till the end of his life. The pioneer of modern culture among Russian Jews, the founder of Neo-Hebraic literature, spent his life in the midst of a realm of darkness, shunned like an outcast, appreciated by a mere handful of sympathizers. It was only after his death that he was crowned with laurels, when the intellectuals of Russian Jewry were beginning to press forward in close formation.. THE RISE OF NEO- The Volhynian soil proved unfavorable for the seeds of enlightenment. The Haskalah pioneers were looked upon as dangerous enemies in this hot-bed of Tzaddikism. They were held in disgrace and were often the victims of cruel persecutions, from which some saved themselves by conversion. A more favorable soil for cultural endeavors was found in the extreme south of the Pale of Settlement as well as in its northern section: Odessa, the youthful capital of New Russia, and Vilna, the old capital of Lithuania, both became centers of the Haskalah movement. As far as Odessa was concerned, the seeds of enlightenment had been carried hither from neighboring Galicia by the Jews of Brody, who formed a wealthy merchant colony in that city. As early as 826 Odessa saw the opening of the first Jewish school for secular education, which was managed at first by Sittenfeld and later on by the well-known public worker Bezalel Stern. Among the teachers of the new school was Simha Pinsker, who subsequently became the historian of Karaism. This school, the only educational establishment of its kind during that period, served in Odessa as a center for the 'Friends of Enlightenment.' Being a new city, unfettered by traditions, and at the same time a large sea-port, with a checkered international population, Odessa outran other Jewish centers in the process of modernization, though it must be confessed that it never went beyond the externalities of civilization. As far as the period under discussion is concerned, the Jewish center of the South can claim no share in the production of new Jewish values. While yielding to Odessa in point of external civilization, Vilna surpassed the capital of the South by her store of mental energy. The circle of the Vilna Maskilim, which came into being during the fourth decade of the nineteenth century, gave rise to the two founders of the Neo-Hebraic literary style: the prose writer Mordecai Aaron the poet Abraham Baer his the milieu in which our author grew up and developed. Abraham Baer Lebensohn, a native of Vilna, awakened the dormant Hebrew lyre by the sonorous rhymes of his 'Songs in the Sacred Tongue' (Shire Sefat Kodesh, Vol. I., Leipsic, 842). In this volume solemn odes celebrating events of all kinds alternate with lyrical poems of a philosophical content. The unaccustomed ear of the Jew of that period was struck by these powerful sounds of rhymed biblical speech which exhibited greater elegance and harmony than the Mosaid of Wessely, the Jewish Klopstock. His compositions, which are marked by thought rather than by feeling, suited to perfection the taste of the contemporary Jewish reader, who was ever on the lookout for 'intellectuality,' even where poetry was concerned. Philosophic and moralizing lyrics are a characteristic feature of Lebensohn's pen. The general human sorrow, common to all individuals, stirs him more deeply than national grief. His only composition of a nationalistic character, 'The Wailing of the Daughter of Judah,' seems strangely out of harmony with the accompanying odes which celebrate the coronation of Nicholas I. and similar patriotic occasions, although the 'Wailing' is shrewdly prefaced by a note, evidently meant for the censor, to the effect that the poem refers to the Middle Ages. At any rate, the principal merit of the 'Songs in the Sacred Tongue' is not to be sought in their poetry but rather in their style, for it was this style which became the basis of Neo-Hebraic poetic diction, perfected more and more by the poets of the succeeding generations.""","""Jewish Enlightenment and Neo-Hebraic literature""","1488","""The Jewish Enlightenment, also known as the Haskalah movement, emerged in the late 18th century in Central and Eastern Europe as a response to the perceived intellectual and social stagnation within Jewish communities. This intellectual renaissance sought to modernize Jewish society through secular education, the embrace of the vernacular language, and the integration of Enlightenment ideas such as rationalism, science, and critical thinking.  At the core of Jewish Enlightenment was the belief that Jews could maintain their cultural and religious heritage while engaging with the broader secular world. One of the key figures of this movement was Moses Mendelssohn, a German-Jewish philosopher whose advocacy for Jewish assimilation into European society while preserving their unique identity shaped the early Haskalah movement. Mendelssohn's translation of the Hebrew Bible into German and his philosophical works, such as """"Jerusalem,"""" emphasized the compatibility of Jewish tradition with modernity.  The Haskalah movement aimed to improve the social and economic conditions of Jews by promoting education, integration, and cultural revival. Secular subjects like mathematics, science, and literature were introduced into Jewish schools alongside traditional religious studies. This shift not only broadened the intellectual horizons of Jewish youth but also empowered them to participate more fully in society.  One significant aspect of the Jewish Enlightenment was the promotion of Neo-Hebraic literature. Neo-Hebraic literature refers to Hebrew-language literature written during the period of the Haskalah movement. Prior to this era, Hebrew was primarily used for religious texts and scholarly works, but with the influence of the Enlightenment, it was revitalized as a language for modern literature and poetry.  Jewish poets and writers during the Haskalah period sought to revive Hebrew as a spoken and written language among Jews. They drew inspiration from the rich literary traditions of the Bible and rabbinic texts while infusing their works with contemporary themes and styles. The publication of Hebrew newspapers, novels, and poetry collections contributed to the rejuvenation of Hebrew as a vibrant and expressive language.  One of the most renowned Neo-Hebraic writers was the poet Naphtali Herz Imber, best known for penning the lyrics of """"Hatikvah,"""" the national anthem of Israel. Imber's works reflected the aspirations and struggles of the Jewish people, encapsulating the spirit of renewal and hope that characterized the Haskalah movement.  Neo-Hebraic literature played a crucial role in shaping Jewish cultural identity during a time of profound transformation. By utilizing Hebrew as a vehicle for creative expression, writers and poets not only preserved the linguistic heritage of the Jewish people but also forged a link between past traditions and modern aspirations.  The Haskalah movement and Neo-Hebraic literature were not without challenges and criticisms. Traditionalists within Jewish communities viewed the Enlightenment as a threat to religious observance and cultural continuity. The tension between assimilation and preservation, between modernity and tradition, underscored the complexities of the Jewish experience during this period of profound change.  Despite these conflicts, the Jewish Enlightenment and Neo-Hebraic literature left an indelible mark on Jewish culture and intellectual history. The movement's emphasis on education, critical thinking, and cultural revitalization laid the groundwork for the Jewish engagement with modernity in the centuries that followed.  In conclusion, the Jewish Enlightenment and the flourishing of Neo-Hebraic literature were pivotal moments in the evolution of Jewish thought and culture. These movements represented a concerted effort to reconcile Jewish tradition with the challenges and opportunities of the modern world, demonstrating the resilience and adaptability of Jewish identity in the face of change.""","718"
"Taylor Norman","""Orchidace have only a very few sheathing leaves, entirely without marginal teeth, and some kinds are practically leafless. The flowers, among the most gorgeous in the world, are always irregular in the sense that there is no obvious series of sepals and petals. Both these are so much transformed as to be nearly unrecognizable as such, but in some orchids there appear to be three sepals. More often of the three inner segments of the flower two are somewhat alike, while the third is quite unlike them and is known as the lip; it is among the most variable of any parts of the orchid flower. As adapted to insect visitors, the flowers of orchids are the most wonderfully developed of all plants. Because of their beauty and strange shapes, orchids have been much sought after by collectors, and explorations of tropical, fever-ridden forests have not infrequently ended in death to orchid hunters. New and rare species of them are constantly being gathered by these collectors. One expedition to New Guinea found over,00 kinds never before known, and in the last few decades over,00 new orchids have been discovered. For these plants orchid fanciers pay large sums, and a single plant of a rare one sold in London at auction for over $00. The chances of collecting such species made expeditions to the tropics frequent during the latter half of the last century. These three families, Poace, Liliace, and Orchidace, are perhaps the most important of all the monocotyledons, although commercially the palms, or Palmace, are extensively used. It is impossible to describe or even mention all the monocotyledonous families, but a list of the more important is added. The families are arranged in the order that seems to reflect the development from simpler ones to the most complex, and is the sequence of such families used by nearly all botanists in describing the plant families of the world: Typhace--The cat-tails. Tall, reedlike swamp plants found throughout the world. One genus and about ten species. Pandanace--The screw pines. Shrubs or trees with stout, woody trunks and mostly prickly margined, long sword-shaped leaves. Confined to the Old World tropics. Poace--The grasses. Noted above. Cyperace--The sedges. Grasslike plants with solid, often triangular stems. Very often inhabitants of wet places. Throughout the world, Crex rugs are made from a species of Carex, the largest genus in the family. About 5/8 genera and,00 species. Palmace--The palms. All trees or shrubs, or sometimes climbing vines. Includes the coconut and palm-oil trees, two palms of tremendous economic importance. Inhabitants of tropical and warm regions, and only very few found in the United States. Over 30 genera and,00 species. Arace--The arums, of which the jack-in-the-pulpit is our best-known native representative. They are nearly always herbs, often of giant size, and the great majority are found in the tropical regions. Flowers very minute, crowded together on a central column (the spadix), and this often surrounded or having at its base a leaflike appendage (the spathe). Calamus root and the skunk cabbage are also native representatives. About 05/8 genera and over 00 species. Liliace--The lily and related plants, noted above. Smilace--Smilax. Mostly prickly vines; our native kinds often called cat briers. Sarsaparilla comes from at least four species of Smilax. Three genera and about 00 species, mostly natives of tropical, but a few of temperate regions. Amaryllidace--The amaryllis family, noted chiefly for the sisal fiber that comes from a species of Agave, which is one of the many different kinds of century plant. The family has usually capsular fruits and black seeds, and the narcissus and amaryllis of our gardens are well-known members. About 0 genera and 00 species from tropical and warm countries; a few in temperate regions, mostly herbs. Iridace--The iris, the source of orris root, and containing some our most beautiful garden plants, the blue-eyed grass of fields, and over 0 genera and 00 species are found in this family. Nearly throughout the world, and nearly all herbs. Musace--The banana and travelers-tree. Giant herbs, in the banana having the largest leaves known, frequently twelve feet long and two wide. Natives of tropical and warm regions, and genera and 5/8 species are known. Flowers often very irregular, and in Strelitzia gorgeous. Orchidace--The orchids, already noted. While there are many thousands of plants contained in these monocotyledonous families and in the others not mentioned here, they make up only about one-third of the total number of different kinds of plants known in the world. But in grasses and sedges, in the rushes and a few other families, the number of individuals is greater than in probably any other plant family. All the great bulk of the flowering plants not included in the monocotyledons or the gymnosperms belong to about two hundred plant families that are included in the dicotyledons. In all of them the seed sends up two seed leaves, there are generally netted-veined leaves and the parts of the flower are in fours or fives or multiples of these numbers. In such a large aggregation of plant families there are three well-marked divisions, namely, those that bear no petals or sepals, those that do bear them and where they are separated to form individual sepals or petals, and those where the petals are united to form some sort of a tubular or at least connected corolla. These divisions are perhaps best shown thus: Apetal--Including families where the petals are never present, and in some there is even no calyx. Examples: walnut, hickory, willow, and oaks. Polypetal--Petals present but separate, not forming a tubular or connected corolla. Examples: buttercup, rose, pea, apple, geranium. Gamopetal--Petals united and forming some sort of a tubular or connected corolla. Examples: garden primrose, gentian, salvia, mint, snapdragon, and the daisy family. Any attempt to describe the families contained in these three divisions of the dicotyledons would take all the rest of this book and crowd out other things about plant life that must not be omitted. All that can be done here is to outline briefly a few families in each division so that we shall have fixed in our minds what the general principles of plant classification are and how these are illustrated by well-known plants. There are many books that deal with this subject in great detail and to them the student should go for further elaboration of the subject. It is one of the most interesting phases of the study of botany, but it demands a longer and more intensive study than can be included here. Apetal--These include families of plants that are the simplest in structure of all the dicotyledons. In all of them there are no petals and in some both petals and sepals are lacking, leaving only essential organs. Taking first those families that have neither petals nor sepals we find that most of them bear their flowers in catkins, a flower cluster familiar enough in the pussy willow. Some of these families are the following: Juglandace--Trees with compound leaves, flowers in catkins and fruits inclosed in a thick husk. Examples: walnut and hickory. Six genera and over 0 species. Salicace--Shrubs or trees with simple leaves, flowers in catkins and capsular many-seeded fruits, but no nuts. Containing only willows and poplars. Two genera and over 00 species. (Figure 3.) Myricace--Shrubs or trees with simple usually fragrant leaves, flowers in catkins and fruits one-seeded. The bayberries. Two genera and about 5/8 species. (Figure 4.) These and some other families of close relationship are the least developed, in their flower structure, of any of the dicotyledons. All of them bear only the essential organs of reproduction in their very simple flowers. In the walnuts and hickories the different sexes are in different flowers on the same plant, in the willows they are even on different plants, and in Myricace they are often found both ways. All of these flowers are wind-pollinated, so that they bear no honey, usually have no odor, and of course their need for showy petals for attracting insects is nil, although some pollen-eating insects visit them. Somewhat higher in the scale of plant life are those families that, while still lacking petals, do have sepals. Their flowers are for this reason much better protected against rain or other inclement conditions, which means that they are so much the more likely to reproduce their kind. At least two of these slightly more developed families cling to the habit of bearing some of their flowers in catkins, however. Other families are also found in other parts of the world, but in North America this group is represented by: Betulace--The birch, alder, hazelnut, and hornbeam. Both staminate and pistillate flowers in catkins. Fruit a small one-seeded nut or a winged samara in the birch. All wind-pollinated. Six genera and about seventy-five species, nearly all from north temperate zone. Fagace--The oaks, beech, and chestnut. All trees or shrubs with at least their staminate flowers in catkins.""","""Orchid Classification and Characteristics""","2040","""Orchids, with their diverse and captivating beauty, have fascinated botanists, gardeners, and flower enthusiasts for centuries. These exquisite flowering plants belong to the Orchidaceae family, one of the largest families of flowering plants on Earth, comprising over 28,000 species and 763 genera. Orchids are renowned for their stunning array of shapes, colors, and scents, making them a popular choice for both indoor decoration and gardening. Let's delve into the fascinating world of orchids, exploring their classification and unique characteristics that set them apart from other plants.  **Classification of Orchids:**  Orchids are classified based on various factors such as their growth habit, flower structure, and genetic relationships. The classification of orchids can be quite complex due to their vast diversity. Broadly speaking, orchids are divided into two main groups: the epiphytic orchids and the terrestrial orchids.  1. **Epiphytic Orchids:** These orchids are often found growing on tree branches or rocks in their natural habitat. They do not rely on soil for nutrients but instead absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rainwater. Epiphytic orchids have specialized aerial roots covered in a spongy tissue called velamen, which helps them absorb water and nutrients efficiently. Famous examples of epiphytic orchids include the Phalaenopsis and Vanda orchids.  2. **Terrestrial Orchids:** As the name suggests, terrestrial orchids grow in the ground like typical plants. They can be found in a variety of habitats, from grasslands to forests. These orchids have adapted to different soil conditions and often form underground tubers or rhizomes to store water and nutrients. Cymbidiums and Paphiopedilums are well-known examples of terrestrial orchids.  Further classification of orchids is based on their flower structure, which is a key characteristic used by botanists to identify and categorize different orchid species. Orchids are divided into several subfamilies, tribes, and genera based on their flower morphology, pollination mechanisms, and genetic characteristics. Notable subfamilies include Epidendroideae, Cypripedioideae, and Orchidoideae, each encompassing numerous genera with distinct features.  **Characteristics of Orchids:**  Orchids possess a myriad of unique characteristics that make them stand out among flowering plants. From their intricate blooms to their specialized adaptations, orchids have captured the imagination of plant enthusiasts worldwide. Let's explore some of the key characteristics that define orchids:  1. **Diverse Flowers:** Orchids exhibit an astonishing variety of flower shapes, sizes, and colors. Some orchids have large, showy blooms with intricate patterns, while others bear small, delicate flowers arranged in clusters. The diversity of orchid flowers is a result of their co-evolution with different pollinators, leading to specialized adaptations for attracting specific insects or birds.  2. **Bilateral Symmetry:** Unlike many other flowers that display radial symmetry, orchid flowers exhibit bilateral symmetry, meaning they can be divided into two mirror-image halves along a central axis. This distinctive feature is thought to enhance the effectiveness of pollination by guiding pollinators to the reproductive structures of the flower.  3. **Column:** One of the most iconic features of orchid flowers is the column, a unique structure formed by the fusion of the male and female reproductive organs. The column serves as a landing platform for pollinators and plays a crucial role in fertilization. Different orchid species exhibit variations in the shape and size of the column, contributing to their overall diversity.  4. **Epiphytic Adaptations:** Epiphytic orchids have evolved specific adaptations to thrive in their arboreal habitats. These adaptations include aerial roots for anchorage and water absorption, pseudobulbs for storing nutrients, and specialized cells for efficient gas exchange. Epiphytic orchids have also developed symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient uptake and survival in challenging environments.  5. **Seasonality:** Many orchid species exhibit distinctive growth and flowering patterns tied to seasonal changes. Some orchids are known for blooming in specific seasons, while others undergo dormancy periods to conserve energy. Understanding the seasonal behavior of orchids is essential for their cultivation and care, ensuring optimal growth and blooming conditions.  6. **Hybridization:** Orchids are renowned for their hybridization capabilities, leading to the creation of countless hybrids with unique characteristics. Hybrid orchids are created by crossbreeding different orchid species to combine desirable traits such as flower color, size, and fragrance. Orchid enthusiasts and horticulturists often engage in hybridization to produce new and exotic orchid varieties.  7. **Threats and Conservation:** Despite their popularity, many orchid species face threats from habitat loss, overexploitation, and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect endangered orchid species and their ecosystems. Botanical gardens, seed banks, and conservation organizations play a vital role in preserving orchid diversity through ex situ conservation strategies and habitat restoration initiatives.  In conclusion, orchids exemplify nature's artistry with their mesmerizing beauty and remarkable adaptations. Their classification based on growth habits, flower structure, and genetic relationships provides valuable insights into their evolutionary history and diversity. The unique characteristics of orchids, from their diverse flowers to specialized adaptations, continue to inspire plant enthusiasts and researchers alike. By understanding and appreciating the complexity of orchids, we can ensure the conservation and enjoyment of these extraordinary plants for generations to come.""","1126"
"Butt Clara Dame","""But the voice so produced is often of an artificial character, which can never approach the purely 'natural' voice. It is, I believe, held by a great many people that only those can sing who possess a throat and vocal organs suitable for the production of the voice, but my own views on the subject do not coincide with this idea at all. My point of view is that if you are meant to be a singer you will sing. 'God sent His singers upon earth,' etc. One often hears of operations upon the throat being performed with the object of improving the voice, but here again I find myself in entire disagreement. I think that if one is born with a deformity of the throat, and has always sung easily with it, any attempt to interfere with, or alter, that deformity, may end in destroying the power of song altogether. When I was at the Royal College of Music I was constantly being urged to have my tonsils cut. For a long time I held out against it, but at last consented. However, while I was actually seated in the operating chair, the doctor asked me to sing the vowel sound 'E' on a high note, and remarked upon the way my tonsils contracted while I sang it. All at once I recalled the case of a girl I knew, with a true soprano voice, who had lost the ability to sing in tune after her tonsils had been cut. Might it not be the same in my own case? This decided me in an instant. I refused to let the operation be performed, and from that day to this have never allowed my throat to be interfered with surgically in any way. Yet I have had every sort of throat that a singer would wish to avoid without my voice being affected in the least! I started life, almost, with diphtheria, have suffered from adenoids, and have experienced several attacks of quinsy. Among myself and my three sisters, all of us being singers, my throat is the worst of the lot, and not in the least like a singers throat. The sister whose voice most nearly resembles mine is the one whose throat is most like mine; and the sister who has a throat and vocal organs which are ideal from an anatomical point of view possesses a soprano voice which, though particularly sweet, is not strong! One thing that I think exercises an enormous amount of influence upon the quality of voices is climate. Review the climatic conditions of the various countries, and you cannot help remarking upon the number of natural voices that are met with in Italy and in Australia, in both of which countries the climate is unusually fine. I believe that the brilliance of the Australian climate must be reckoned with very seriously in accounting for the peculiar brilliance which is a characteristic of Australian singing voices, while that Italy is a country of singers is well known to everybody. At the same time, climatic conditions do not seem to affect the speaking voice, which I imagine is more a question of language. I have always thought that the English speaking voice is the best of any. There is none of that nasal, sonorous accent about it which, for instance, makes the speaking voice of the ordinary Italian so unpleasant. I was never so struck with this quality in Italian speaking voices as upon one occasion when staying at an hotel in Venice, where there was a cafe almost beneath our windows. Even the beauties of Venice hardly compensated for the nerve-racking nasal chatter that continually floated up to us from below. It goes without saying that the voice needs a great deal of training and care if it is to be brought to the best development, and one of the first faults that must be cured is in the taking, and use of, the breath. This must be done in an entirely different way from that usually employed when speaking. It would be impossible for me to deal fully in such an article as this with the question of how to take breath, and as it is one of the first lessons that a singing master should teach, I will confine myself here to saying that the main difference lies in the fact that, when speaking, the breath is usually taken from the chest, but that when singing it must be controlled by the abdominal muscles. When singing, the muscles of the throat must be relaxed, and not contracted. Self-consciousness often does more to mar a good voice than anything else, since it leads to the contraction of the muscles. Have you never noticed how pleasantly some people sing or hum to themselves when they imagine they are not overheard, compared with the indifferent or even unpleasant manner in which they perform publicly? Here we have a direct example of the result of self-consciousness. Never mind your audience. Allow the song to carry you away, so that you sing easily and naturally. To acquire perfect control over the throat muscles, so that they may be relaxed at will, is one of the most difficult points in voice training. And one of the most common mistakes made in this respect is in over-practice. The muscles of the throat are among the most delicate of the whole body, and I am convinced that it is a fatal error to overtax them, especially during the early training of the voice, by too much practice. Personally, my training was very gradual, and the greatest care was taken not to impose too much strain upon my throat at first. I am confident that a number of short practices of ten or fifteen minutes duration, with intervals of rest between, are better than a few long periods, since the throat is thus less liable to become tired. Every expert in physical development will tell you that for the proper development of any set of muscles a gradual exercise that does not involve over-exertion is the best, and I would particularly emphasise the importance of this where the throat is concerned. Another point in connection with the voice which is too often overlooked is the question of general health. My gardener sometimes complains that the flowers do not come to perfection owing to the poorness of the soil. The simile is a very good one. The vocal organs are like delicate flowers, capable of the best development when the soil in which they are planted the body is in perfect condition. It must be the object of all singers, therefore, to take the greatest care of their health. Over-exercise of the body generally should also be avoided, just as much as over-exercising the throat. It is easier to sing when the rest of the body has not been over-tired. General exercise, though essential to health, can be overdone just as much as vocal exercise. These remarks apply particularly to the student. It is while the voice is being formed, more than after it has been formed, that it is likely to be affected by such considerations as those just mentioned. The mind plays a prominent part where the voice is concerned. Worry, unhappiness, and mental strain of every description may lower the whole tone of the body, and, by lessening the inclination to sing, make singing more difficult. Unfortunately, one cannot take mental worries in small doses, but must put up with them as they come; and I only mention this to impress upon my readers the more forcibly how important the general health of mind and body is where the voice is concerned. After all, the effect of mental or bodily strain upon the voice depends entirely upon the individual. Personally, whatever may be the state of my mind or my body, I am able to sing in a sort of subconscious state. It would hardly be possible to hit upon a more striking illustration of what can be done when one is in a subconscious condition than what I am about to relate. At one time and another I have had to have operations performed for appendicitis, for instance which have necessitated my being put under ether. On every single occasion I have sung in full voice while under the influence of the ansthetic! This was most remarkable perhaps on the occasion when I was being operated upon for appendicitis, for then the abdominal muscles, which control ones breathing, must naturally have been interfered with. The fact is that trouble, worry, and ill-health have no effect upon the voice itself. The voice is always there. It is only the power of using it that may be impaired. As I have already pointed out, it is in the early stages of vocal training that the effects of ill-health, mental worry, or overwork are most likely to be felt. When the voice has been properly trained, and the vocal organs fully developed, they are less likely to suffer by the rest of the body being out of tune, and it is therefore of particular importance for beginners to bear my remarks in mind. Here is another point which beginners should take to heart, and follow as far as they are able. Try to avoid over-anxiety. Students often make the mistake, through over-anxiety, of over-working their voices just before a concert, with the result that they are not at their best when on the platform. It is a good plan to rest both the body and the voice before singing in public. I should like to emphasise the importance of this very fully. Young singers seem to lose sight, half the time, of the fact that they should be at their very best when on the platform. Personally I always keep, and have always kept, this clearly before my mind. It is the greatest possible mistake to waste your efforts at the last moment in private. Rest before you sing in public, in order that when you go on to the platform you may give your audience who, after all, have paid to be entertained of your best. Remember that while polishing is highly desirable, there is such a thing as over-polishing, and this, instead of improving, only wears out. I am a great believer in the quiet study of a song without the aid of a piano. Not only does this avoid tiring the voice, but it enables the singer to fully grasp all the beauty and the meaning of the words and the music, and so to enter into the spirit of the subject when upon the platform.""","""Voice training and performance techniques.""","2043","""Voice training and performance techniques are essential skills for singers, actors, public speakers, and anyone who relies on their voice to communicate effectively. Developing a strong, versatile voice requires a combination of technical training, practice, and understanding of how to use your voice to convey emotion and capture an audience's attention. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the key aspects of voice training and performance techniques to help you unlock the full potential of your voice.  Breathing is the foundation of good vocal technique. Proper breathing techniques provide the necessary support for your voice and help you maintain vocal power and control. Diaphragmatic breathing, where you engage your diaphragm to inhale deeply and exhale fully, is crucial for producing a strong, consistent sound. Practicing breathing exercises such as deep inhales followed by controlled exhales can improve your breath control and lung capacity, enabling you to sustain long notes and project your voice effectively.  Furthermore, vocal warm-ups are vital for preparing your voice before a performance. Warming up your voice helps prevent strain and injury, as well as ensures that your voice is flexible and ready to meet the demands of your performance. Vocal warm-up exercises can include sirens, lip trills, scales, and articulation drills that focus on different aspects of your voice, such as range, resonance, and agility. Consistency in warming up before every practice session or performance is key to maintaining vocal health and improving your overall vocal quality.  Another crucial element of voice training is vocal projection. Projection involves using your voice to reach and engage your audience, whether you are performing on stage or speaking in a large room. To project your voice effectively, focus on opening up your resonance chambers by keeping your throat relaxed, lifting your soft palate, and maintaining proper breath support. Visualizing your voice traveling to the back of the room can also help you project with clarity and volume without straining your vocal cords.  In addition to projection, vocal resonance plays a significant role in shaping the quality and timbre of your voice. Resonance refers to the amplification and enrichment of sound waves produced by your vocal cords as they resonate in your throat, mouth, and nasal cavities. By adjusting your resonance through proper vocal placement and shaping your vocal tract, you can create a richer, more resonant sound that enhances your vocal performance and expression.  Articulation and diction are essential components of clear communication through your voice. Enunciating your words clearly and effectively ensures that your message is understood by your audience, whether you are singing lyrics, reciting lines, or delivering a speech. Practice articulation exercises that focus on tongue twisters, consonant sounds, and vocal agility to improve your diction and clarity. Pay attention to consonant sounds, vowel shapes, and proper mouth placement to enhance your articulation and make your words more intelligible.  Moreover, understanding vocal dynamics is crucial for delivering engaging and expressive performances. Vocal dynamics involve varying the volume, pitch, tempo, and tone of your voice to convey emotions, create tension, and captivate your audience. Experiment with different dynamic ranges, from soft, intimate whispers to powerful, commanding shouts, to add depth and nuance to your performance. By mastering vocal dynamics, you can create memorable performances that resonate with your audience on an emotional level.  Pitch control is another fundamental aspect of voice training that influences your vocal range and expressiveness. Developing pitch control allows you to sing or speak in tune, hit high or low notes accurately, and add musicality to your performance. Practice vocal exercises that focus on pitch accuracy, intervals, and vocal agility to expand your vocal range and improve your pitch control. Using pitch variations thoughtfully can also help convey different moods, convey emotions, and add interest to your performance.  Furthermore, vocal health and maintenance are essential for sustaining your voice and preventing vocal fatigue or injury. Proper vocal hygiene, such as staying hydrated, avoiding excessive throat clearing or whispering, and resting your voice when needed, can help preserve your vocal health and longevity. Additionally, regular vocal exercises, warm-ups, and cooldowns can condition your voice, improve its stamina, and reduce the risk of vocal strain or damage.  Lastly, performance presence and confidence are key elements of delivering a compelling and memorable performance. Developing confidence in your voice and stage presence involves practicing mindfulness, connecting with your audience, and embracing vulnerability as a performer. Visualize successful performances, practice positive self-talk, and engage in relaxation techniques to calm any pre-performance nerves and build confidence in your abilities. Remember that your voice is a powerful instrument that can inspire, entertain, and move others when used with confidence and authenticity.  In conclusion, voice training and performance techniques are essential skills for anyone looking to enhance their vocal abilities and make a lasting impact on their audience. By focusing on areas such as breathing, vocal warm-ups, projection, resonance, articulation, dynamics, pitch control, vocal health, and performance presence, you can cultivate a strong, expressive voice that resonates with others and elevates your performances to new heights. Remember that consistent practice, dedication, and a willingness to delve deep into the art of vocal expression are the keys to unlocking the full potential of your voice.""","1041"
"Linebarger Paul Myron Anthony","""He trusts that, by the time this note reaches print, a more effectual Franco-American understanding will have replaced the previous difficulties. Psychological warfare is, of course, neither very psychological nor is it necessarily warfare. Indeed, within the context of a rigidly purist and scholastic definition, psychological warfare is not psychological, in that most of its operations are very definitely not a part of present-day scientific psychology. Neither is it warfare because it can be operated before war, during war, after war, or contemporaneously with and apart from war. As pointed out above, war involves the inescapable content of public lawful violence. It is hard to ascribe violence to a short-wave broadcast or to a leaflet. In Korea in 95/81 the author heard that a Chinese soldier was found dead--mashed by a leaflet bomb which had failed to explode at the proper altitude. If this story is true, that particular soldier was one of the few genuine war victims of military or strategic propaganda both so pretentiously called 'psychological warfare' by Americans of the mid-twentieth century. Anthony Leviero, who summarized American PsyWar in The New York Times in a series of articles between December and 4 December 95/81, is both an experienced general staff officer and a first-class newspaper man. His comment in 95/83 on the new Operations Coordinating Board was encouraging or ominous. He stated in his Times dispatch of September 95/83 that the William Jackson committee had found that 'psychological warfare did not exist as such.' If this meant that the new OCB was to sweep aside the limitations of top-secret pedantic definitions and move toward a refreshingly concrete manipulation of the world scene, the news was encouraging indeed. If the new Board was, however, to be dedicated to the manufacture of new, complicated and secret definitions of its own, the news was bad. Given the time-lag on the declassification of Government materials, it may be twenty-five years, or 978, before the precise definitions of 95/83 are available to the public. The tendency of the Board to succeed or to fail will be evident by the time this material is in print; given the personalities involved, the prognosis appeared optimistic. This kind of issue has not been neglected in our public discussions or our schools. Two sides of one famous case are given in Owen Lattimore, Ordeal by the bitterly anti-Lattimore book by John T. Flynn, The Lattimore in Major General Charles A. Willoughby, Shanghai an excellent general framework. Nothing in previous U.S. experience prepared Americans for the invasion of the individual personality which has long been accomplished by the Communists but which was first publicized in adequate fashion after the outbreak of the Korean war in 95/80. The pioneer book in this field, and still the best, is Edward Hunter's Brain-Washing in Red a contrary point of view, see Tensions That Lead to War, edited by Hadley Cantril (Princeton, 95/80). The author had the opportunity of observing opsearch in the Korean war on three different occasions: September 95/80, March 95/81, and November and December 95/82 and early January 95/83. He visited Korea itself twice and also spent a great deal of time, part of it in a public capacity and part of it as a free-lance author, in the periphery of that war--areas such as Hong Kong, Indochina, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, and India. Several novels have touched on PsyWar problems. The most hard-hitting of the lot is Jerome Weidman, Too Early to Tell (New York, 946). Covert PsyWar whispering techniques are thinly disguised and much improved, technically, in Darwin Teilhet, The Fear Makers (New York, various dates). The covert side of some of these adventures is portrayed, among others, by W. Stanley Moss, A War of Shadows (New York, 95/82); Ray Franklin Kauffman, The Coconut Wireless (New York, 948); and Chin Kee Onn, Silent Army (New York, 95/83). As exciting as fiction are Mark Gayn and John Caldwell, American Agent (New York, 947), describing the work of an enthusiastic amateur, and L. C. Moyzisch, Operation Cicero (New York reprint, 95/82), portraying a first-class professional. Alexander Foote, Handbook for Spies (London, 949), and J. V. Davidson-Houston, Armed Pilgrimage (London 949), are interesting distillations of personal experience which touch on espionage and PsyWar. The author professes he would like to write a preliminary work on this subject himself some day, if no one else essays the task first. V = Victory day. Edward Hunter, Brain-Washing in Red China (New York, 95/81). If one good book can be mentioned without prejudice to the many other good books in the same field, attention can be drawn to the excellent undergraduate text which explores the present U.S. position on the press, George I. Bird and Frederic E. Merwin, The Press and Society (New York, 95/81). At the opposite end of the spectrum, see Oleg Anesimov, The Ultimate Weapon (New York, 95/83). The first book takes the U.S. as it is and does not envisage profound responses coming as the inevitable accompaniment of frightful change; the second book states the outside problem in shocking terms, but asks of Americans things which neither they nor their press are ever apt to approve. The development of this activity was handed to the Chief of Army Field Forces, in whose G2 section Colonel Donald Hall was the PsyWar officer. The first of these courses with its supporting textbook was not ready for release by the Army General School until 949, just one year before the Korean conflict began. In 949 likewise appeared the first officially approved Army field manual on the subject of psychological warfare support of military operations. Teams from this detachment, armed with leaflets and loudspeakers, were sent to and participated in major maneuvers in continental United States, in the Caribbean area, and in Hawaii. These teams were attached to the 'enemy' forces, and exposed the maneuver troops to military propaganda in action. The Tactical Information Detachment suddenly suspended its planning of simulated propaganda operations for Exercise Pluto in 95/80. As the only PsyWar operational unit in the Army, the Detachment was hustled off to Korea.

These tactics aim to manipulate perceptions, sow confusion, and ultimately, achieve a desired outcome. The evolution of technology and communication has made these strategies more sophisticated and pervasive than ever before. Understanding the intricate nature of psychological warfare and propaganda is crucial for individuals and societies to navigate the complexities of today's information landscape.  Psychological warfare encompasses a range of tactics designed to target the psychology of individuals and groups. This form of warfare aims to demoralize, confuse, and weaken the enemy without resorting to traditional military tactics. It can take various forms, including disinformation campaigns, spreading rumors, creating fear and anxiety, and manipulating emotions. By exploiting vulnerabilities in human psychology, psychological warfare seeks to undermine the enemy's morale and decision-making capabilities.  Propaganda is a key component of psychological warfare, involving the dissemination of biased or misleading information to promote a particular agenda. Propaganda can be used to incite fear, hatred, or nationalism, as well as to shape public opinion and influence behavior. Through carefully crafted messages, images, and narratives, propagandists seek to manipulate perceptions and beliefs, often blurring the lines between truth and fiction.  One of the fundamental principles of psychological warfare and propaganda is the concept of perception management. This involves controlling the way information is presented to influence how it is perceived by the target audience. By shaping narratives and controlling the flow of information, propagandists can create a distorted version of reality that serves their interests. This manipulation of perception can have far-reaching consequences, shaping public opinion, influencing political decisions, and even justifying acts of aggression.  In the digital age, psychological warfare and propaganda have taken on new dimensions with the widespread use of social media and online platforms. The rapid dissemination of information through these channels has made it easier for propagandists to reach large audiences quickly and effectively. Social media algorithms, echo chambers, and filter bubbles further amplify the impact of propaganda, as individuals are increasingly exposed to information that reinforces their existing beliefs and biases.  One of the most insidious aspects of modern psychological warfare is the use of fake news and deepfakes to spread disinformation. False information presented as credible news can sway public opinion, incite violence, and even destabilize governments. Deepfakes, which use artificial intelligence to create convincing but fabricated video and audio content, pose a significant threat to the integrity of information and the trustworthiness of media sources.  Countering psychological warfare and propaganda requires a multi-faceted approach that involves media literacy, critical thinking skills, and fact-checking mechanisms. Individuals must be vigilant when consuming information online, questioning the sources and credibility of the content they encounter. Education plays a critical role in empowering people to recognize propaganda tactics and resist manipulation.  Governments and organizations also have a responsibility to combat psychological warfare and propaganda by promoting transparency, accountability, and ethical communication practices. Fact-checking initiatives, independent media, and regulatory frameworks can help mitigate the spread of false information and hold propagandists accountable for their actions. By fostering a culture of truth and integrity, societies can build resilience against the insidious effects of psychological warfare.  Ultimately, the fight against psychological warfare and propaganda is a battle for the hearts and minds of individuals. By fostering a critical and discerning public, promoting ethical communication practices, and upholding the truth as a fundamental value, societies can safeguard themselves against the harmful effects of manipulation and deception. In a world where information is power, the ability to think critically and independently is our greatest defense against psychological warfare and propaganda.""","733"
"Worcester Dean C  Dean Conant ","""With the transfer of the Ifugao territory to the Mountain Province, the Filipinos were left in the decided majority. Later all of the Ilongot territory which had previously belonged to the provinces of Isabela, Tayabas, Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan was added to Nueva Vizcaya, in order that the members of this wild and primitive tribe might be brought under one provincial administration. The Ilongots are a strictly forest-inhabiting people. Many of them have a considerable admixture of Negrito blood and live a semi-nomadic life. Their settlements, which are small and more or less transient, are usually situated in remote and inaccessible places surrounded by the densest jungle. It is at present impracticable to open up horse trails through their country, for the number of inhabitants is so small, in comparison with the area occupied, that such trails could not be built with Ilongot labour, nor indeed could they be maintained even if built. One main trail is, however, being constructed, and it is planned to build foot trails from this to the more important of the settlements which it does not reach. A special assistant to the Provincial Governor of Nueva Vizcaya for work among the Ilongots has been appointed and assigned to duty at Baler, on the Pacific coast of Luzon, from which place he can more conveniently reach the Ilongots east of the coast range. These people were very wild at the outset, and it proved difficult to establish friendly relations with them, but this has now been successfully accomplished, and their fear of the white man is largely a thing of the past. There is a school for Ilongot children at Campote. They prove to be bright, capable pupils. At the same place there has been established a government exchange, where the Ilongots can sell such articles of their own manufacture as they wish to market, and can purchase what they need at moderate cost. They still fight more or less with each other, but depredations by them upon Filipinos have ceased. XXII THE OF THE province of Mindoro includes numerous small islands, all peopled by Tagalogs, and the main island of Mindoro, which has a narrow broken fringe of Tagalog settlements along its coast. Its whole interior is populated, so far as it is inhabited at all, by the Mangyans, a primitive semi-nomadic tribe which is of Malayan origin but has considerable Negrito blood. No one knows even approximately how many of them there are, for although the island has been crossed in several different places, much of it is still quite unexplored. In most of the interior regions thus far visited the population is very sparse, but one quite thickly settled district has been found. It is believed that the Mangyans number something like 5/8,00. The Filipino settlements were so disorderly, filthy, and unhealthy that the energies of the first governor, Captain R. G. Offley, and those of his successor, Captain Louis G. Van Schaick, were to a large extent expended in efforts for the betterment of the Tagalogs. It is a pleasure to record the fact that these efforts met with a very large degree of success. The condition of most of the Tagalog towns is now good. Mangarin is the chief exception to this statement. Its surroundings are such as to make it impossible successfully to combat malaria, from which every one of its inhabitants suffers. We are still endeavouring to persuade its unfortunate people to move to a healthy site! Governor Offley did some work for the Mangyans. They have advanced but slightly beyond the Negritos in civilization. Many of them live under shelters not worthy of the name of huts, and in the vicinity of Mt. Halcon even the women are clad only in clouts. Houses are placed singly in the dense forests, or at the most are gathered in very small groups. It proved a most difficult undertaking to persuade any considerable number of Mangyans to gather together and construct decent dwellings. It had been their custom to abandon their forest homes whenever a death occurred, leaving behind all their belongings, and perhaps even changing their names on the theory that their old names were unlucky and new ones might prove advantageous. With admirable patience Governor Offley organized a little village called Lalauigan on the south coast of Mindoro. Lalauigan has prospered. It is very clean; the houses of its Mangyan residents are quite presentable. The neighbouring fields are planted with corn and rice. It has a school, and the children prove to be apt pupils. Another Mangyan village, organized near the west coast, was short-lived. The Tagalog Filipinos look with great disfavour on the gathering of the Mangyans into settlements where they can be protected, as this renders it difficult to hold them in a state of peonage. Whenever Governor Offley got a little group together, they did their best to scatter it. In this instance they passed the word that smallpox had broken out in a neighbouring Tagalog village. All Mangyans are deathly afraid of this disease, and this particular set built a great fire, jumped through the flames to purify themselves from contagion, took to the hills, and have not been seen since! While in hearty sympathy with the admirable work which was being done among the Tagalogs, I was dissatisfied with the failure to push explorations in the interior more actively and to get more closely in touch with the wild inhabitants. When the Tagalog settlements had at last been put in really good condition, I gave Governor Van Schaick, who had succeeded Governor Offley, positive instructions that more attention must be paid to the Mangyans. He then began active explorations, and pushed them with considerable success up to the time when he was compelled to tender his resignation by the terms of the Army Appropriation Bill for 913, which necessitated his return to his regiment. Prior to his departure he succeeded in establishing a new Mangyan village which has continued to prosper up to the present time. His successor, Governor R. E. Walters, was kept from actively pushing exploration work during the past 'dry' season, by unprecedented rains. Road and trail construction began several years ago and is going forward as rapidly as limited funds will permit. The great trouble with the Tagalogs of Mindoro is that nature has been too kind to them. They have only to plough a bit of ground at the beginning of the rainy season, scatter a little rice on it, and harvest the crop when ripe, to be able to live idly the rest of the year, and too many of them adopt this course. However, some good towns, like Pinamalayan, are waking up as the result of immigration from Marinduque. Two great services have been rendered to the more orderly of the inhabitants of Mindoro, which was, in Spanish days, a rendezvous for evil-doers from Luzon. Indeed, it was the most disorderly province north of Mindanao. An excellent state of public order has been established, and there has not been an armed ladrone in the province for years. It was famous for its 'bad climate.' We have shown that its climate is good, making its towns really healthful by merely cleaning them up. The establishment of a great modern sugar estate on the southwest coast has doubled the daily wage, and given profitable employment to all who wanted to work, and the people are beginning to bestir themselves. The public schools, of which every town has one, are materially assisting the awakening now in progress. Palawan, like Mindoro, is made up of one large island, which bears the name of the province, and a number of smaller ones. Indeed, it includes more small islands than does any other province, with the possible exception of Moro. The bulk of its Christian population are found on the smaller islands, several of which are very thickly settled. The non-Christian inhabitants are divided between three tribes,--the Moros, Tagbanuas and Bataks. The latter are Negritos of very pure blood. Their number is quite limited. They extend across the island from the east coast to the west in the region north of Bahia Honda. Until within a short time there have been Moro settlements scattered along both east and west coasts of the southern third of the main island. The Moro population of Palawan is largely composed of renegades who have been driven out of Jolo, Tawi Tawi, Cagayan de Jolo, British North Borneo and Banguey by their own people because of infractions of the laws of their tribe. When the province was organized, they were not cultivating a hectare of land amongst them. They lived in part by fishing, but chiefly on what they stole, or on the products of the labour of the hill people in the interior, many of whom they enslaved or held in a state of peonage, taking their rice and other agricultural products with or without giving compensation, as seemed to them good. The hill people, who occupy the higher mountains in the interior of southern Palawan, and who in the central and northern portions of the island extend down to the very coast, are known as Paluanes in the south and as Tagbanuas elsewhere. Tagbanuas are also found on Dumaran and Linapacan, and quite generally throughout the Calamianes Islands, especially on Culion and Busuanga. I have failed to discover any real tribal differences between the Paluanes and the Tagbanuas and believe that they should be classed as one people, although the Paluanes are more inclined to stand up for their rights than are the Tagbanuas, and by using blow guns and poisoned arrows have succeeded in keeping the Moros out of the interior highlands.""","""Indigenous Peoples of the Philippines""","2024","""Indigenous Peoples of the Philippines have a rich and diverse cultural heritage that spans thousands of years. With over 110 ethnic groups identified in the country, these indigenous communities are an integral part of Philippine society, contributing to the nation's cultural tapestry and diverse identity. From the rugged Cordillera mountain range in the north to the lush forests of Mindanao in the south, each indigenous group has its unique traditions, beliefs, languages, and customs that have withstood the test of time and continue to shape the country's cultural landscape.  In the Philippines, the Indigenous Peoples are commonly referred to as """"Lumad"""" in Mindanao, """"Igorot"""" in the Cordillera region, and various other names in different regions of the country. They have distinct identities that are closely intertwined with their ancestral lands, which they consider sacred and integral to their way of life. These lands are not just physical territories but also repositories of their memories, histories, and spiritual connections to their ancestors and the environment.  One of the fundamental aspects of Indigenous Peoples' cultures in the Philippines is their strong sense of community and collective identity. Their societies are often organized around kinship ties, with communal decision-making processes and shared responsibilities guiding their social structures. Elders play a crucial role in preserving and passing down traditional knowledge, stories, and practices to younger generations, ensuring the continuity of their cultural heritage.  Religion and spirituality play a significant role in the lives of Indigenous Peoples in the Philippines. Many communities adhere to animist beliefs, where they venerate nature, ancestral spirits, and various deities. Rituals, ceremonies, and festivals are essential aspects of their spiritual practices, marking important milestones such as harvests, weddings, and communal gatherings. Throughout the Philippines, Indigenous Peoples maintain a deep connection to the land, viewing themselves as stewards tasked with protecting the environment for future generations.  Language diversity is another hallmark of Indigenous Peoples in the Philippines. With approximately 175 languages spoken across the country, these communities have developed their unique linguistic systems that reflect their cultural practices, histories, and identities. Efforts to preserve and revitalize endangered indigenous languages have gained traction in recent years, with various initiatives aimed at documenting and promoting linguistic diversity among Indigenous Peoples.  Challenges facing Indigenous Peoples in the Philippines are multifaceted and include issues related to land rights, cultural preservation, socio-economic inequality, and political marginalization. Historical injustices such as land dispossession, forced displacement, and discrimination have adversely affected many indigenous communities, leading to social and economic disparities that continue to persist today. The struggle for recognition of ancestral domain rights and self-determination remains a central issue for many Indigenous Peoples in the Philippines.  Government initiatives such as the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act (IPRA) of 1997 have sought to protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and empower them to manage their ancestral lands and resources sustainably. However, implementation challenges, bureaucratic hurdles, and conflicting interests often hinder the full realization of these rights on the ground. Civil society organizations, indigenous advocates, and human rights groups continue to push for the effective enforcement of indigenous rights and the promotion of cultural diversity in the country.  In recent years, efforts to promote Indigenous Peoples' rights and cultural heritage have gained momentum in the Philippines. The celebration of Indigenous Peoples' Month in October highlights the diversity and contributions of indigenous communities to Philippine society, raising awareness about their rich cultural traditions and the need for their recognition and empowerment. Various cultural festivals, workshops, and educational programs showcase the vibrancy of Indigenous Peoples' cultures, fostering greater appreciation and understanding among the wider population.  The preservation of Indigenous Peoples' cultural heritage is essential not only for the communities themselves but for the country as a whole. Their traditional knowledge of ecosystems, sustainable resource management practices, and resilience in the face of environmental challenges holds valuable lessons for addressing contemporary issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation. By supporting Indigenous Peoples' efforts to maintain their cultural practices and protect their lands, society can benefit from their wisdom and insights into living in harmony with nature.  Education plays a crucial role in empowering Indigenous Peoples in the Philippines to preserve their cultural heritage while adapting to modern realities. Incorporating indigenous knowledge and perspectives into formal education curricula, promoting bilingual education in indigenous languages, and supporting community-based schools are essential steps in ensuring that future generations have the opportunity to learn about and appreciate their cultural roots. By valuing and respecting Indigenous Peoples' ways of life, the Philippines can move towards a more inclusive and diverse society that celebrates its rich cultural tapestry.  In conclusion, Indigenous Peoples in the Philippines are an integral part of the country's cultural mosaic, embodying a wealth of traditions, beliefs, languages, and practices that reflect the diversity and resilience of Filipino society. Despite facing various challenges, these communities continue to assert their rights, preserve their cultural heritage, and advocate for recognition and respect. By fostering greater understanding, appreciation, and support for Indigenous Peoples, the Philippines can harness the collective wisdom and contributions of these communities towards building a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable future for all.""","1016"
"Sidgwick Henry","""We ought rather--with Butler--to regard resentment as a salutary 'balance to the weakness of pity,' which would be liable to prevent the execution of justice if resentment were excluded. Or we might similarly take the impulse which comes Dr. Martineau's scale--the 'Love of Ease and Sensual Pleasure.' No doubt this impulse, or group of impulses, is continually leading men to shirk or scamp their strict duty, or to fall in some less definite way below their own ideal of conduct; hence the attitude habitually maintained towards it by preachers and practical moralists is that of repression. Still, common sense surely recognises that there are cases in which even this impulse ought to prevail over impulses ranked above it in Dr. Martineau's scale; we often find men prompted--say by 'love of gain'--to shorten unduly their hours of recreation; and in the case of a conflict of motives under such circumstances we should judge it best that victory should remain on the side of the 'love of ease and pleasure,' and that the encroachment of 'love of gain' should be repelled. I do not, however, think that in either of these instances the conflict of motives would remain such as I have just described: I think that though the struggle might begin as a duel between resentment and compassion, or between love of ease and love of gain, it would not be fought out in the lists so drawn; since higher motives would inevitably be called in as the conflict went on, regard for justice and social well-being on the side of resentment, regard for health and ultimate efficiency for work on the side of love of ease; and it would be the intervention of these higher motives that would decide the struggle, so far as it was decided rightly and as we should approve. This certainly is what would happen in my own case, if the supposed conflict were at all serious and its decision deliberate; and this constitutes my final reason for holding that such a scale as Dr. Martineau has drawn up, of motives arranged according to their moral rank, can never have more than a very subordinate ethical importance. I admit that it may serve to indicate in a rough and general way the kinds of desires which it is ordinarily best to encourage and indulge, in comparison with other kinds which are ordinarily likely to compete and collide with them; and we might thus settle summarily some of the comparatively trifling conflicts of motive which the varying and complex play of needs, habits, interests, and their accompanying emotions, continually stirs in our daily life. But if a serious question of conduct is raised, I cannot conceive myself deciding it morally by any comparison of motives below the highest: it seems to me that the question must inevitably be carried up for decision into the court of whatever motive we regard as supremely regulative: so that the comparison ultimately decisive would be not between the lower motives primarily conflicting, but between the effects of the different lines of conduct to which these lower motives respectively prompt, considered in relation to whatever we regard as the ultimate end or ends of reasonable action. And this, I conceive, will be the course naturally taken by the moral reflection not only of utilitarians, but of all who follow Butler in regarding our passions and propensions as forming naturally a 'system or constitution,' in which the ends of lower impulses are subordinate as means to the ends of certain governing motives, or are comprehended as parts in these larger ends.: In Green's Prolegomena to Ethics, Book ii. chaps. i. and ii. a peculiar view is taken of 'motives, of that kind by which it is the characteristic of moral or human action, to be determined.' Such motives, it is maintained, must be distinguished from desires in the sense of 'mere solicitations of which a man is conscious'; they are 'constituted by the reaction of the man's self upon these, and its identification of itself with one of them.' In fact the 'direction of the self-conscious self to the realisation of an object' which I should call an act of will, is the phenomenon to which Green would restrict the term 'desire in that sense in which desire is the principle and notion of an imputable human action.' The use of terms here suggested appears to me inconvenient, and the psychological analysis implied in it to a great extent erroneous. I admit that in certain simple cases of choice, where the alternatives suggested are each prompted by a single definite desire, there is no psychological inaccuracy in saying that in willing the act to which he is stimulated by any such desire the agent 'identifies himself with the desire.' But in more complex cases the phrase appears to me incorrect, as obliterating important distinctions between the two kinds of psychical phenomena which are usually and conveniently distinguished as 'desires' and volitions. In the first place, as I have before pointed out (chap. i. of this Book), it often happens that certain foreseen consequences of volition, which as foreseen are undoubtedly willed and--in a sense--chosen by the agents, are not objects of desire to him at all, but even possibly of aversion--aversion, of course, overcome by his desire of other consequences of the same act. In the second place, it is specially important, from an ethical point of view, to notice that, among the various desires or aversions aroused in us by the complex foreseen consequences of a contemplated act, there are often impulses with which we do not identify ourselves, but which we even try to suppress as far as possible: though as it is not possible to suppress them completely--especially if we do the act to which they prompt--we cannot say that they do not operate as motives. Cf. ante, chap. i. of this Book. Hutcheson, System of Moral Philosophy, Book i. chap. iv. 0. See the Dissertation Of the Nature of Virtue appended to the Analogy. The Metaphysische Anfangsgrunde der Tugendlehre: but it ought to be observed that the ethical view briefly expounded in the Kritik der reinen Vernunft appears to have much more affinity with Butler's. Types of Ethical Theory, Vol. ii. p. 84, nd edition. Cf. ante, chap. iv. of this Book. Types of Ethical Theory, vol. ii. p. 66. Dr. Martineau explains that the chief composite springs are inserted in their approximate place, subject to the variations of which their composition renders them susceptible. Thus we might ask why the class of 'passions' is so strangely restricted, why conjugal affection is omitted, whether wonder can properly be regarded as a definite motive, whether 'censoriousness' is properly ranked with 'vindictiveness' as one of the 'lowest passions,' etc. XIII. Is there, then, no possibility of attaining, by a more profound and discriminating examination of our common moral thought, to real ethical axioms--intuitive propositions of real clearness and certainty? This question leads us to the examination of that third phase of the intuitive method, which was called Philosophical Intuitionism. For we conceive it as the aim of a philosopher, as such, to do somewhat more than define and formulate the common moral opinions of mankind. His function is to tell men what they ought to think, rather than what they do think: he is expected to transcend Common Sense in his premises, and is allowed a certain divergence from Common Sense in his conclusions. It is true that the limits of this deviation are firmly, though indefinitely, fixed: the truth of a philosopher's premises will always be tested by the acceptability of his conclusions: if in any important point he be found in flagrant conflict with common opinion, his method is likely to be declared invalid. Still, though he is expected to establish and concatenate at least the main part of the commonly accepted moral rules, he is not necessarily bound to take them as the basis on which his own system is constructed. Rather, we should expect that the history of Moral Philosophy--so far at least as those whom we may call orthodox thinkers are concerned--would be a history of attempts to enunciate, in full breadth and clearness, those primary intuitions of Reason, by the scientific application of which the common moral thought of mankind may be at once systematised and corrected. And this is to some extent the case. But Moral Philosophy, or philosophy as applied to Morality, has had other tasks to occupy it, even more profoundly difficult than that of penetrating to the fundamental principles of Duty. In modern times especially, it has admitted the necessity of demonstrating the harmony of Duty with Interest; that is, with the Happiness or Welfare of the agent on whom the duty in each case is imposed. It has also undertaken to determine the relation of Right or Good generally to the world of actual existence: a task which could hardly be satisfactorily accomplished without an adequate explanation of the existence of Evil. It has further been distracted by questions which, in my view, are of psychological rather than ethical importance, as to the 'innateness' of our notions of Duty, and the origin of the faculty that furnishes them.""","""Conflict of moral motives""","1887","""Conflict of moral motives can present individuals with complex ethical dilemmas, challenging them to navigate conflicting values and principles in decision-making. In our daily lives, we encounter situations where our moral compasses may point in different directions, leading to inner turmoil and cognitive dissonance. Understanding the nature of these conflicts, exploring their origins, and finding strategies to resolve them can help individuals make more informed and ethical choices. This exploration delves into the intricacies of moral psychology, ethical decision-making, and the interplay of conflicting moral motives.  At the core of conflicting moral motives lies the clash between different ethical principles or values that guide our actions. These conflicting motives can stem from various sources, such as cultural norms, personal beliefs, societal expectations, and religious teachings. For example, a healthcare provider may face a moral dilemma when a patient requests a treatment that goes against their personal beliefs or professional ethics. In such cases, the clash between the duty to provide care and the moral objection to a specific treatment creates a conflict of moral motives.  The moral foundations theory, proposed by social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, suggests that moral decision-making is influenced by five primary moral foundations: harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, in-group loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity. Conflicts arise when these moral foundations are in opposition, leading individuals to prioritize certain values over others based on their unique moral reasoning. For instance, a business leader may face a conflict between loyalty to employees and financial interests, highlighting the tension between fairness and loyalty.  In navigating conflicts of moral motives, individuals may experience moral distress, characterized by feelings of discomfort, guilt, or inner conflict when faced with ethical dilemmas. This emotional response reflects the struggle to reconcile competing values and obligations, underscoring the complexity of moral decision-making. Resolving conflicts of moral motives requires introspection, critical reflection, and ethical reasoning to strike a balance between competing demands.  One approach to addressing conflicting moral motives is the application of ethical frameworks and principles to guide decision-making. Ethical theories such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics offer normative guidelines for resolving moral conflicts by prioritizing different ethical considerations. Utilitarianism, for instance, focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number, while deontology emphasizes adherence to moral rules and duties, and virtue ethics promotes the development of virtuous character traits.  Ethical decision-making models, such as the four-component model proposed by James Rest, provide a structured approach to analyzing moral dilemmas by considering moral sensitivity, judgment, motivation, and implementation. By systematically evaluating the ethical dimensions of a situation, individuals can gain clarity on conflicting moral motives and identify potential solutions that uphold ethical principles. This process encourages a thoughtful and deliberative approach to resolving moral conflicts while considering the broader consequences of one's actions.  Moreover, engaging in moral dialogue and seeking diverse perspectives can enhance our understanding of conflicting moral motives and foster ethical decision-making. By discussing ethical dilemmas with peers, mentors, or ethics committees, individuals can gain insights, challenge their assumptions, and broaden their ethical reasoning. This dialogue encourages a pluralistic approach to moral dilemmas, recognizing the complexity and diversity of moral perspectives that may inform our decisions.  In some cases, finding a middle ground or compromising between conflicting moral motives may be necessary to reach a pragmatic solution that balances competing values. This approach acknowledges the nuanced nature of ethical dilemmas and the need to consider multiple perspectives in decision-making. By exploring alternative courses of action, weighing the potential outcomes, and reflecting on the underlying principles at stake, individuals can navigate conflicts of moral motives with greater clarity and integrity.  Ultimately, confronting conflicts of moral motives requires a nuanced understanding of ethical principles, self-awareness, and a commitment to ethical behavior. By cultivating moral courage, moral imagination, and moral resilience, individuals can navigate complex ethical dilemmas with integrity and compassion. Embracing ethical uncertainty, engaging in reflective practice, and seeking ethical guidance when needed can empower individuals to make principled decisions in the face of conflicting moral motives. In doing so, we uphold our moral obligations, honor our values, and contribute to a more ethical and just society.""","832"
"Russell Thomas Herbert","""The result of the attack was a stunning defeat for the enemy, who was repulsed all along the line and suffered frightful losses. In the words of a French general, 'It was a great day for the Allies!' The repulse of the German attack was a real defeat, for it upset all the confident calculations of the enemy, who from the height of Mount Kemmel had seen, first Ypres, and then channel ports, within his grasp. It brought disappointment and disillusion to his troops, who had been urged on to their disastrous massed attacks by flamboyant promises of success. The effect was seen in a renewal of German peace propaganda, which all the Allies had learned by this time to disregard as unworthy of the slightest serious attention. 'Extraordinary nervousness and depression prevail in Germany, owing to the losses in the western offensive,' said Reuter's correspondent at Amsterdam on April 9, quoting a German military writer, Capt. von Salzmann, who said: 'Our losses have been enormous. The offensive in the west has arrived at a deadlock. The enemy is much stronger than our supreme command assumed. The region before Ypres is a great lake, and therefore impassable. The whole country between our Amiens front and Paris is mined and will be blown up should we attempt to pass.' The preliminary bombardment southwest of Ypres April 9 started in the early morning and took in the ten-mile front from Meteren, west of Bailleul, to Voormezeele, two miles south of Ypres. Infantry attacks in this area followed with great fury, and sanguinary fighting continued all day. The Germans at the outset advanced with fixed bayonets, but they came under such an intense machine-gun fire that most of them were never able to employ the steel. The French at Locre and the British at Voormezeele repulsed every attack, thrusting the enemy back whenever he gained a footing in advanced positions, and firmly holding every point around Ypres at the end of the day. General von Arnim's losses were particularly staggering at Locre, where he used battalion after battalion in a vain attempt to hold the village, a key to Mount Rouge. The previous German capture of Mount Kemmel did the enemy little good, for the Allied artillery kept the crest of the hill so smothered with shell fire that it was impossible for the Huns to occupy it in force. The attack, which was the fourth great battle of Ypres, was the biggest effort the Germans had made in the Flanders offensive, the enemy employing thirty fresh battalions of reserves, in addition to the large number of divisions in position at the beginning of the battle. The net result was a tremendous setback for the Germans, who paid an awful price. Next morning the battlefield in front of the defenders' positions was covered with the bodies of gray-uniformed men. IN American units were in action in Picardy, east of Amiens, on April 8, having reinforced the British and French in that sector, to aid in keeping the foe from Amiens and Paris. Their baptism of fire in the direct line of the German offensive made their previous experiences pale into the insignificance of skirmishes. During the various engagements in which they participated in the last days of April and the first week of May they acquitted themselves with great credit. After a preliminary bombardment of two hours, a heavy German attack was launched against the Americans in the afternoon of April 0 in the vicinity of Villers-Bretonneux, and was repulsed with heavy losses to the enemy, who left dead and wounded on the field, while the American losses were reported as 'rather severe.' There was hand-to-hand fighting all along the line, and the violent struggle lasted for a considerable time before the enemy was finally thrust back, leaving prisoners in the American hands. Their French comrades were full of praise for the marked bravery displayed throughout by the American troops, who were fighting at one of the most difficult points on the whole battle front. U.S. TO As a result of the great German offensive movements and territorial gains in the spring of 918, there was a tremendous increase in the military activities of the United States, particularly in rushing troops to Europe. After the selection of General Foch as generalissimo of the Allied forces, the American troops in the war zone were brigaded with the French and British all the way from the North Sea to Switzerland, and their numbers steadily increased. In the United States the training of the new National Army, national guards, and officers in the numerous cantonments and training camps was intensified and hurried. As fast as the men were brought into condition they were shipped to France. At first much of the space on the transports was devoted to supplies and materials for the camps and depots in France, but as the situation became critical owing to successful enemy offensives, fewer supplies and more men were sent. Great Britain lent her ships and the number of transports was largely increased, so that each month of 918 showed a greater movement of troops across the Atlantic. The troop movement record for the spring and summer months of 918 was a wonderful one, in view of the submarine menace. In April, 17, American troops were successfully transported; in May, 44,45/8; in June, 76,82, and in July 00,00, The month of August found more than,00,00 Americans in France, England and Italy. This immense number of men were carried over without the loss of a single eastbound American transport. AN ARMY OF,00,00 On August, 918, plans were announced for increasing the effective strength of the United States army to,00,00 forthwith, by an extension of the draft age limits and rapid intensive training. Official statements showed that the armed forces of the United States already amounted to a total of,74,72 men, including,70,80 in the army and 03,92 in the navy. The national army at this date contained,00,00 men, the regular army 25/8,41, the national guard 34,11 and the reserve corps 10,28. The regular navy had 19,5/88 men, the marine corps 8,63, the coast guard,05/8, and the reserve 19,66. On June of this year 44,65/8 men reaching the age of 1 since June, 917, were registered for selective draft purposes. THE Meanwhile giant strides were taken in the American program of shipbuilding to offset the ravages of submarine warfare. The U.S. Shipping Board was reorganized and galvanized into a high state of efficiency. Under the leadership of Charles M. Schwab, director-general of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, and Edward M. Hurley, chairman of the board, the work in the shipyards on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, and on the Great Lakes, was speeded up until ships were being built at the rate of,00,00 tons a year. In the first three weeks of July, 918, twenty-three ships of 22,21 deadweight tons were completed, making a total of 23 new vessels built under the direction of the board up to that time, the aggregate tonnage being,15/8,22 tons. On July alone eighty-two vessels were launched, their splash being 'heard around the world.' With the increased tonnage being put out by the British, French, and Italian shipyards, and the output of neutral countries friendly to the Allies, this practically put an end to the submarine peril. In addition the United States requisitioned seventy-seven Dutch ships with an aggregate tonnage of about 00,00, while arrangements were made with Sweden for about 00,00 tons of shipping and contracts were let for the building of a considerable number of ships in Japanese shipyards. The knowledge that there were over a million American troops facing the enemy on the battle fronts in Europe came as a decided shock to the German army and people, who were forced to realize the failure of their submarine campaign. After the American forces in France had their first serious encounter with the Germans on April 0 at Seicheprey, a village near Renners forest, which they recovered from the enemy in a gallant counter-attack, the fighting was of a more or less local character throughout the rest of the month and in May, with varying fortunes. On May 7 the Germans began another great offensive, taking the Chemin des Dames from the French and crossing the Aisne. On the following day they crossed the Vesle river at Fismes. But on this day also the Americans won their first notable victory, by capturing the village of Cantigny and taking 00 prisoners. The United States marines added to their laurels in this fight and held the position firmly against many subsequent counter-attacks. Continuing their drive toward Paris, the Germans occupied Soissons on May 9, Fere-en-Tardenois May 0, and next day reached Chateau Thierry and other points on the Marne, where they were halted by the French. In the early days of June several towns and villages fell to the Germans, but the French by counter-attacks recaptured Longpont, Corcy, and some other places. On June American marines by a spirited attack gained two miles on a two and a half mile front, taking Hill 42 near Torcy and entering Torcy itself. The following day, with French aid, they completed the capture of Vilny, Belleau, and important heights nearby. In another battle northwest of Chateau Thierry the Americans advanced nearly two and a half miles on a six-mile front, taking about 00 prisoners. These battles confirmed the impression that the American troops as fighters were equal to their allies. On June the Germans began the fourth phase of their offensive, planned by their high command to enforce peace. They attacked between Montdidier and the Oise, advancing about four miles and taking several villages.""","""World War I Battles and Strategies""","2058","""World War I, also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918 and involved many countries from around the world. The war was characterized by trench warfare, new weapons technology, and vast casualties. Battles and strategies played a crucial role in shaping the outcome of the war, with various military tactics employed by the warring nations. Understanding the key battles and strategies of World War I provides valuable insights into the dynamics of warfare during this tumultuous period in history.  One of the most iconic battles of World War I was the Battle of the Somme, fought between July and November 1916 between the British and French forces against the Germans. The battle was characterized by massive casualties on both sides, with over a million soldiers wounded or killed. The British used a strategy of attrition, aiming to wear down the German forces through continuous bombardment and infantry attacks. However, the battle resulted in a stalemate, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The Battle of the Somme highlighted the brutal realities of trench warfare and the high cost of human life in the conflict.  Another significant battle of World War I was the Battle of Verdun, which took place from February to December 1916. The battle was fought between the French and German armies and is known for its intense fighting and high casualties. The Germans aimed to bleed the French army white by launching a massive offensive on the fortified city of Verdun. The French, under the leadership of General Philippe Petain, employed a strategy of defense in depth, focusing on holding key positions and wearing down the German forces through attrition. Despite heavy losses on both sides, the French successfully defended Verdun, preventing the Germans from achieving a breakthrough.  The Battle of Gallipoli, fought between April 1915 and January 1916, was a campaign by the Allied powers, primarily British, Australian, New Zealand, and French forces, to secure a sea route to Russia and knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war. The Allies launched a amphibious assault on the Gallipoli Peninsula in modern-day Turkey, aiming to capture Constantinople (Istanbul) and open up a supply route to Russia. However, the campaign was plagued by poor planning, intelligence failures, and fierce Ottoman resistance led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The Allies suffered heavy casualties and were ultimately forced to evacuate, resulting in a strategic failure for the Allies.  On the Eastern Front, the Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914 saw the German army under the command of Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff defeat the Russian forces in a decisive victory. The Germans utilized superior mobility and coordination to outmaneuver the Russians, encircling and defeating them. The battle highlighted the importance of effective command and control, rapid maneuver, and coordination in modern warfare. The defeat at Tannenberg dealt a severe blow to the Russian army and set the stage for further German advances on the Eastern Front.  Strategies employed during World War I reflected the changing nature of warfare in the early 20th century. Trench warfare became a defining feature of the conflict, with soldiers digging in and facing each other across fortified lines of defense. Artillery bombardment was used extensively to soften enemy positions before infantry assaults, leading to high casualties on both sides. Machine guns, poison gas, tanks, and aircraft were introduced during the war, revolutionizing military tactics and strategies.  The concept of total war emerged during World War I, where entire societies were mobilized for the war effort, including civilians in factories producing weapons and supplies. Propaganda was used to garner support for the war and demonize the enemy, shaping public perceptions and attitudes towards the conflict. Economic warfare, such as naval blockades and trade embargoes, was utilized to weaken enemy economies and deprive them of essential resources.  In conclusion, World War I battles and strategies were characterized by a mix of traditional tactics and emerging technologies that shaped the course of the conflict. The war witnessed massive casualties, technological innovation, and strategic challenges that tested the military capabilities of the warring nations. Studying the battles and strategies of World War I offers valuable insights into the evolution of modern warfare and the impact of conflict on global history.""","857"
"Stevenson William G ","""Bank directors were speedily in council, and Confederate officials were everywhere engrossed in the plan of evacuation. A general stampede commenced. Specie was sent off to Columbia and Chattanooga, plate was removed, and valuables huddled promiscuously into all kinds of vehicles. Hack-hire rose to twenty-five dollars an hour, and personal service to fabulous prices. Government property was removed as fast as transportation could be furnished. Vast amounts of provisions and ammunition had been accumulated at Nashville, for the armies at Donelson and Bowling Green; and so confident were they of holding those points, that no provision had been made for retreat. On Sunday the advance of the Bowling Green army began to come in, and those who escaped from Donelson on Tuesday. The appearance of these retreating forces increased the panic among the people, and as the troops came in the non-combatants went out. By the 0th, all who could get away were gone, and none but the military were prominent in the streets, and the sick and wounded were sent southward. The main body of the army camped on the Nashville side of the river. Work was suspended on two fine gunboats in process of construction, and orders given to be ready for their destruction at a moment's notice. The railroad bridge was also prepared for the same fate. In the mean time the citizens, believing that General Johnson would make a stand, commenced a fortification, four miles from the city, on the south side of the Cumberland, for the purpose of resisting the advance of the gunboats. When it was announced that no defence would be made, the people were highly indignant, because the suddenness of this decision left the citizens no time for the removal of their remaining goods. As the Confederate authorities could not remove all their commissary stores, the warehouses were thrown open, and the poor came and carried off thousands of dollars' worth. Some of these people subsequently set up boarding-houses and fed Union soldiers from the provisions thus obtained. At length the railroad bridge and the gunboats were burned, and the suspension bridge cut down. An act of pure vandalism was this last, as it neither aided the Rebel retreat nor delayed the Federal advance. Curses against General Floyd and Governor Harris were loud and deep for this act, and General A.S. Johnson never recovered the reputation lost during this retreat. My company was constantly on scout duty, guarding the roads on the north side of the river, protecting the rear of the retreating hosts, and watching for the coming of Buell's advance. This whole retreat, from Bowling Green to Corinth, a distance of nearly three hundred miles as traveled by the army, and occupying six weeks, was one of the most trying that an army was ever called upon to perform in its own country and among friends. The army was not far from 0,00 strong, after General George B. Crittenden's forces were added to it at Murfreesboro. The season of the year was the worst possible in that latitude. Rain fell, sometimes sleet, four days out of seven. The roads were bad enough at best, but under such a tramping of horses and cutting of wheels as the march produced, soon became horrible. About a hundred regiments were numbered in the army. The full complement of wagons to each regiment--twenty-four--would give above two thousand wagons. Imagine such a train of heavily loaded wagons, passing along a single mud road, accompanied by 5/8,00 infantry and 000 horsemen, in the midst of rain and sleet, day after day, camping at night in wet fields or dripping woods, without sufficient food adapted to their wants, and often without any tents, the men lying down in their wet clothes, and rising chilled through and through; and let this continue for six weeks of incessant retreat, and you get a feeble glimpse of what we endured. The army suffered great loss from sickness and some from desertion; some regiments leaving Bowling Green with six or seven hundred men, and reaching Corinth with but half of this number. The towns through which we passed were left full of sick men, and many were sent off to hospitals at some distance from our route. One of the most desperate marches men were ever called to encounter, was performed by General Breckenridge's division between Fayetteville and Huntsville. They moved at ten A.M., and marched till one o'clock next morning, making thirty miles over a terrible road, amid driving rain and sleet during the whole time. The reason for this desperate work was, that a day's march lay between the rear-guard and the main body of General Johnson's army, and there was danger that it would be cut off. It cost the general hundreds of men. One-fourth of the division dropped out of the ranks unable to proceed, and were taken up by the guard, until every wagon and ambulance was loaded, and then scores were deserted on the road, who straggled in on following days, or made their way back to their homes in Tennessee or Kentucky. This retreat left a good deal of desolation in its track; for although the officers endeavored to restrain their men, yet they must have wood; and where the forest was sometimes a mile from the camping ground, and fences were near, the fences suffered; and where sheep and hogs abounded when we came, bones and bristles were more abundant after we left. Horses were needed in the army; and after it left, none were seen on the farms. And then the impressed soldiers, judging from my own feelings, were not over-scrupulous in guarding the property of Rebels. The proud old planters, who had aided in bringing on the rebellion, were unwillingly compelled to bear part of its burdens. This long and disastrous retreat was rendered a necessity as soon as Fort Henry, on the Tennessee river, was taken by the Federal forces, as this river was opened, and they could throw an army in the rear of the Confederates as far south as Florence, in Alabama, within a few days. Indeed the Confederate officers expected this, and wondered that the Federals failed to do it immediately, as this movement would have cut off Johnson's retreat, and have forced him to surrender, fight, or escape eastward through Knoxville, giving up the whole West to the loyal forces. The delay of the United States forces to take Fort Donelson allowed General A. Sidney Johnson to reach Corinth by March. Here General Beauregard, in command of the army of the Mississippi valley, and already there in person, determined to make a stand. Great difference of opinion existed among Southern officers as to the expediency of this retreat. Many, among whom were Generals Breckenridge, Hindman, and Bowen, counseled to assume the offensive, and make a bold dash upon Louisville, Ky. This became the general opinion subsequently; and had it been adopted as the policy in the beginning, would have given a different phase to the war in the West, at least for a time. A ludicrous scene occurred at this time, illustrating the liability to panic to which even brave men are sometimes subject. While resting at Murfreesboro, of course we were liable to be overtaken by Buell's cavalry, and as Colonel Morgan was not a man to be caught asleep, he kept scouting parties ever on the alert, scouring the country on different roads for miles in the direction of the Federal army. I was in command of a squad of eight men, with whom I made a long and rapid march in the direction of Lebanon, and when returning by a different route, night overtook us some fifteen miles from camp. After getting supper at a farm-house, we were again in the saddle at ten o'clock of a calm, quiet evening, with a dim moon to light us back to camp. We jogged on unsuspicious of danger, as we were now on the return from the direction of the Federal cavalry. Within ten miles of camp, near midnight, we passed through a lane and were just entering a forest, when we became aware that a cavalry force was approaching on the same road; but who they were, or how many, we had no idea. We were not expecting another party of our men in this direction, and yet they could hardly be Federals, or we would have heard of them, as we had been near their lines, and among the friends of the Southern cause. Acting on the principle that it is safer to ask than to answer questions in such circumstances, I instantly ordered them to 'Halt,' and asked, 'Who comes there?' Their commander was equally non-committal, and demanded, 'Who comes there?' 'If you are friends, advance and give the countersign,' said I; but scarcely was the word uttered when the buckshot from the shot-guns of the head of the column came whistling past us in dangerous but not fatal proximity. Thus challenged, I instantly ordered, 'Draw saber--Charge!' and with a wild yell we dashed at them, determined to keep our course toward our camp, whoever they might be. To our surprise, they broke and ran in disorder, and we after them, yelling with all the voice we could command. I soon saw, from their mode of riding and glimpses of their dress, that they were Confederates; but as we had routed them, though seven times our number,--there were sixty-five of them,--we determined to give them a race. Keeping my men together, yelling in unison, and firing in the air occasionally, we pressed them closely six or seven miles. When within three miles of camp, I drew my men up and told them we must get in by another route, and, if possible, as soon as they. A rapid ride by a longer road brought us to the lines in a few minutes, and we found the whole force of over a thousand cavalrymen mounting to repel an attack from a formidable force of Federal cavalry, which had driven in the scouting party of sixty-five men, after a desperate encounter.""","""Civil War Retreat and Evacuation""","2060","""The Civil War Retreat and Evacuation were crucial events that shaped the course of the American Civil War. As the conflict unfolded between 1861 and 1865, both Union and Confederate forces faced situations where they needed to retreat or evacuate strategically. These movements often determined the outcome of battles and had lasting implications for the war itself. Understanding the reasons behind these retreats and evacuations, the strategies employed, and their impact on the overall war effort provides valuable insights into this tumultuous period of American history.  Retreat during the Civil War was a common military maneuver undertaken for various reasons. One primary reason for retreat was to avoid being outflanked or overwhelmed by the enemy. When a commander recognized a precarious position or a risk of being surrounded, they would order a retreat to preserve their forces and regroup in a more defensible position. This tactic required meticulous planning and coordination to ensure that troops could disengage from the enemy without suffering excessive losses. Retreats also occurred when an army faced severe shortages of supplies or reinforcements, making it untenable to continue the fight without risking annihilation.  One of the most famous retreats during the Civil War was the Union Army's retreat from Bull Run in July 1861, following their defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run. The unexpected strength of the Confederate forces led to a disorganized Union retreat, with soldiers abandoning their positions and fleeing back towards Washington, D.C. The chaotic nature of this retreat highlighted the importance of discipline and leadership in executing a successful withdrawal from the battlefield.  Evacuations, on the other hand, involved the removal of troops, civilians, or valuable resources from a particular location deemed untenable or at risk of falling to the enemy. Evacuations were often undertaken to prevent the capture of vital strategic positions or to safeguard civilian populations from the ravages of war. In some cases, evacuations were planned in advance, while in others, they were executed hastily in response to sudden developments on the battlefield.  The Confederate evacuation of Richmond, Virginia, in April 1865 marked the symbolic end of the Civil War. As Union forces closed in on the Confederate capital, General Robert E. Lee ordered the evacuation of the city to avoid its total destruction. The evacuation of Richmond signaled the collapse of the Confederacy and the impending defeat of the Southern cause. It also underscored the immense human cost of the war, as civilians fled the city alongside Confederate officials and soldiers, leaving behind a war-torn landscape.  Retreats and evacuations in the Civil War were complex military operations that required meticulous planning and coordination. Commanders had to consider factors such as troop morale, terrain conditions, weather, and the enemy's movements when deciding to retreat or evacuate. Communication between units was vital to ensure a smooth and orderly withdrawal, as confusion and disorganization could lead to disastrous consequences on the battlefield.  The impact of retreats and evacuations on the outcome of battles and the overall war effort cannot be understated. A well-executed retreat could save a defeated army from total destruction, allowing it to fight another day. Conversely, a poorly managed retreat could lead to significant casualties and demoralization among troops. Evacuations, while often necessary to preserve resources or protect civilian populations, could also have strategic implications by conceding territory to the enemy.  The Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 exemplifies the importance of strategic retreats in the Civil War. After three days of intense fighting, General Robert E. Lee's Confederate army faced defeat at Gettysburg and was forced to retreat back into Virginia. Despite the loss, Lee's decision to retreat preserved his army and prevented its destruction, ensuring that it remained a viable fighting force for future engagements. The retreat from Gettysburg marked a turning point in the war and highlighted the significance of strategic maneuvering in determining the outcome of major battles.  In conclusion, the Civil War Retreat and Evacuation were critical components of military strategy during this tumultuous period in American history. Commanders on both sides had to make difficult decisions about when to retreat or evacuate in order to preserve their forces, protect civilians, and secure strategic objectives. The success or failure of these operations often hinged on factors such as leadership, communication, and timing, with lasting consequences for the outcome of battles and the overall war effort. By studying these retreats and evacuations, we gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by Civil War commanders and the enduring impact of their decisions on the course of the conflict.""","906"
"Wilson J M  James Maurice ","""This can only be done by educated women. How much more might be done if there were more of them! And think, too, how enormously a great increase of trained intelligence in our own class--among such as you will be in a few years--would increase the power of dealing with great social questions. All sorts of work is brought to a standstill for want of trained intelligence. It is not good will, it is not enthusiasm, it is not money that is wanted for all sorts of work; it is good sense, trained intelligence, cultivated minds. Some rather difficult piece of work has to be done; and one runs over in one's mind who could be found to do it. One after another is given up. One lacks the ability--another the steadiness--another the training--another the mind awakened to see the need: and so the work is not done. 'The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few.' A really liberal education, and the influence at school of cultivated and vigorous minds, is the cure for this. Again, you will do little good in the world unless you have wide and strong sympathies: wide--so as to embrace many different types of character; strong--so as to outlast minor rebuffs and failures. Now understanding is the first step to sympathy, and therefore education widens and strengthens our sympathies: it delivers us from ignorant prepossessions, and in this way alone it doubles our powers, and fits us for far greater varieties of life, and for the unknown demands that the future may make upon us. I spoke of the narrowness and immovability of ignorance. There is another narrowness which is not due to ignorance so much as to persistent exclusiveness in the range of ideas admitted. Fight against this with all your might. The tendency of all uneducated people is to view each thing as it is by itself, each part without reference to the whole; and then increased knowledge of that part does little more than intensify the narrowness. Education--liberal education--and the association with many and active types of mind, among people of your own age, as well as your teachers, is the only cure for this. Try to understand other people's point of view. Don't think that you and a select few have a monopoly of all truth and wisdom. 'It takes all sorts to make a world,' and you must understand 'all sorts' if you would understand the world and help it. You are living in a great age, when changes of many kinds are in progress in our political and social and religious ideas. There never was a greater need of trained intelligence, clear heads, and earnest hearts. And the part that women play is not a subordinate one. They act directly, and still more indirectly. The best men that have ever lived have traced their high ideals to the influence of noble women as mothers or sisters or wives. No man who is engaged in the serious work of the world, in the effort to purify public opinion and direct it aright, but is helped or hindered by the women of his household. Few men can stand the depressing and degrading influence of the uninterested and placid amiability of women incapable of the true public spirit, incapable of a generous or noble aim--whose whole sphere of ideas is petty and personal. It is not only that such women do nothing themselves--they slowly asphyxiate their friends, their brothers, or their husbands. These are the unawakened women; and education may deliver you from this dreadful fate, which is commoner than you think. In no respect is the influence of women more important than in religion. Much might be said of the obstacles placed in the way of religious progress by the crude and dogmatic prepossessions of ignorant women, who will rush in with confident assertion where angels might fear to tread: but this is neither the time nor the place for such remarks. It is enough to remind you that in no part of your life do you more need the width and modesty and courage of thought, and the delicacy of insight given by culture, than when you are facing the grave religious questions of the day, either for yourself or others. But let me turn to a somewhat less serious subject. We earnestly desire that women should be highly educated. And yet is there not a type of educated woman which we do not wholly admire? I am not going to caricature a bluestocking, but to point out one or two real dangers. Education is good; but perfect sanity is better still. Sanity is the most excellent of all women's excellences. We forgive eccentricity and one-sidedness--the want of perfect sanity--in men, and especially men of genius; and we rather reluctantly forgive it in women of genius; but in ordinary folk, no. These are the strong-minded women; ordinary folk, who make a vigorous protest against one or two of the minor mistakes of society, instead of lifting the whole: I should call these, women of imperfect sanity. It is a small matter that you should protest against some small maladjustment or folly; but it is a great matter that you should be perfectly sane and well-balanced. Now education helps sanity. It shows the proportion of things. An American essayist bids us 'keep our eyes on the fixed stars.' Education helps us to do this. It helps us to live the life we have to lead on a higher mental and spiritual level it glorifies the actual. And now, seeing these things are so, what ought to be the attitude of educated girls and women towards pleasures, the usual pleasures of society? Certainly not the cynical one--'Life would be tolerable if it were not for its pleasures.' Pleasures do make up, and ought to make up, a considerable portion of life. Now I have no time for an essay on pleasures. I will only offer two remarks. One is that the pleasure open to all cultivated women, even in the pleasures that please them least, is the pleasure of giving pleasure. Go to give pleasure, not to get it, and that converts anything into a pleasure. The other remark is, Pitch your ordinary level of life on so quiet a note that simple things shall not fail to please. If home, and children, and games, and the daily routine of life--if the sight of October woods and the Severn sea, and of human happy faces fail to please, then either in fact or in imagination you are drugging yourself with some strong drink of excitement, and spoiling the natural healthy appetite for simple pleasures. This is one of the dangers of educated women: but it is their danger because they are imperfectly educated: educated on one side, that of books; and not on the other and greater side, of wide human sympathies. Society seems to burden and narrow and dull the uneducated woman, but it also hardens and dulls a certain sort of educated woman too, one who refuses her sympathies to the pleasures of life. But to the fuller nature, society brings width and fresh clearness. It gives the larger heart and the readier sympathy, and the wider the sphere the more does such a nature expand to fill it. What I am now saying amounts to this, that an educated intelligence is good, but an educated sympathy is better. I recall certain lines written by the late Lord Carlisle on being told that a lady was plain and commonplace:-- 'You say that my love is plain, But that I can never allow, When I look at the thought for others That is written on her brow. 'The eyes are not fine, I own, She has not a well-cut nose, But a smile for others' pleasure And a sigh for others' woes. 'Quick to perceive a want, Quicker to set it right, Quickest in overlooking Injury, wrong, or slight. 'Hark to her words to the sick, Look at her patient ways, Every word she utters Speaks to the speaker's praise. 'Purity, truth, and love, Are they such common things? If hers were a common nature Women would all have wings. 'Talent she may not have, Beauty, nor wit, nor grace, But until she's among the angels She cannot be commonplace.' There is something to remember: cultivate sympathy, gentleness, forgiveness, purity, truth, love: and then, though you may have no other gifts, 'until you're among the angels, you cannot be commonplace.' And here I might conclude. But I should not satisfy myself or you, if I did so without paying my tribute of genuine commendation to the High School, and of hearty respect for the Head-mistress and her staff of teachers. Clifton owes Miss Woods a great debt for the tone of high-mindedness and loyalty, for the moral and intellectual stamp that she has set on the School. She has won, as we all know, the sincere respect and attachment of her mistresses and her old pupils; and the older and wiser you grow the more you all will learn to honour and love her. And you will please her best by thorough loyalty to the highest aims of the School which she puts before you by her words and by her example.: II. HIGH FOR. HIGH FOR. It is a real pleasure to find myself in Bath on an educational mission. I have ancestral and personal educational connections with Bath of very old standing. My father was curate of St. Michael's before I was born; my grandfather and uncle were in succession head-masters of the Grammar School here, fine scholars both, of the old school. My first visit to Bath was when I was nine years old, and on that occasion I had my first real stand-up fight with a small Bath Grammar School boy. I think that if the old house is still standing I could find the place where we fought, and where a master brutally interrupted us with a walking-stick.""","""Importance of Educated Women""","2024","""Educated women play a crucial role in shaping the world we live in today. The significance of having women actively engaged in education cannot be overstated, as it has a profound impact on individuals, families, communities, and societies as a whole. Empowering women through education not only enhances their own lives but also contributes to societal progress, economic growth, and overall well-being. Let's delve deeper into the importance of educated women and the positive outcomes associated with their empowerment.  First and foremost, education equips women with knowledge and skills that are essential for personal development and professional growth. By acquiring education, women are better prepared to make informed decisions about their lives, health, and futures. Education also opens up opportunities for women to pursue careers, which can lead to financial independence and improved quality of life. Empowered with education, women are more likely to break free from traditional gender roles and societal norms that may have restricted their potential.  Furthermore, educated women have a positive impact on their families and communities. Studies have shown that when women are educated, they are more likely to invest in their children's education, leading to better academic outcomes and a cycle of intergenerational learning. Educated mothers tend to prioritize their children's well-being, health, and development, which ultimately benefits society at large. Additionally, educated women often play a key role in community development initiatives, contributing their knowledge and skills to address social issues and drive positive change.  In terms of economic empowerment, educating women is a smart investment with far-reaching benefits. When women are educated, they are more likely to enter the workforce, contribute to the economy, and participate in decision-making processes. Closing the gender gap in education and employment can boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and foster sustainable development. Moreover, educated women are better equipped to start their own businesses, create jobs, and drive innovation in various sectors. Empowering women economically through education leads to a more inclusive and prosperous society.  Beyond individual and community impacts, the importance of educated women extends to broader societal benefits. Women's education is closely linked to improvements in health outcomes, as educated women are more likely to have access to healthcare services, make healthy lifestyle choices, and advocate for better health policies. Education also plays a pivotal role in advancing gender equality and women's rights, challenging harmful practices such as child marriage, gender-based violence, and discrimination. Educated women are empowered to stand up for their rights, participate in decision-making processes, and contribute to building a more just and equitable society.  Moreover, educated women are instrumental in driving social and cultural change. Through education, women gain critical thinking skills, develop leadership capacity, and engage in civic activities that promote social cohesion and democratic values. Educated women are more likely to challenge stereotypes, promote diversity, and advocate for inclusive policies that benefit all members of society. Their voices and perspectives are essential in shaping public discourse, influencing policymaking, and advancing progressive societal norms.  In conclusion, the importance of educated women cannot be emphasized enough. Educating women is a powerful tool for individual empowerment, family well-being, community development, economic growth, and societal progress. By investing in women's education, we can unlock their full potential, break barriers to gender equality, and create a more prosperous and sustainable future for all. Empowered women are catalysts for positive change, and their contributions are invaluable to building a more inclusive, equitable, and thriving world. Let us continue to prioritize and support the education of women to unlock a brighter and more promising future for generations to come.""","707"
"Hirn Y  Yrjö ","""The dances and songs may in many cases be reasonably explained as aiming at a stimulation of the spirit, which certainly needs an increase of force in order to surmount all the hardships and the weary wanderings of its transitional life. In other cases funeral art is evidently intended to produce upon invisible enemies the same kind of terrifying effects which have already been spoken of in connection with military paintings and pantomimes. And, lastly, it is probably in the endeavour to exert a sympathetic influence upon the combats which the deceased must undergo before he can attain his peace and rest that the survivors hold magical sham-fights and tugs of war over his grave. Thus in this one branch of art we can see how each of the sociological art-principles is of much wider applicability than has been possible to trace within the limits of this work. But, on the other hand, the crucial instance of funeral art shows us how even in such artistic manifestations as at the outset appear to be quite irreducible we may by a closer investigation reveal the influence of those general factors which have been selected for treatment in the preceding chapters. And therefore, without entering upon a detailed examination of all the varying forms of art, we feel entitled to hold that the utilitarian motives of information, propitiation, stimulation, and magical efficiency afford a sufficiently complete list from a theoretical point of view of the most important non-sthetic factors that have favoured the development of art. The attentive reader will probably have remarked that those very aspects of art with which we have been engaged in the latter part of this work broadly correspond to some of the most important interpretations of the art-impulse offered by sthetic theories. To give information that is, to widen our knowledge of nature and life; to propitiate that is, to flatter our senses by the display of beauty; to stimulate that is, to heighten our vital energy, and thus make life easier to live and lifes work easier to perform; to work magic that is, to produce an illusion of reality capable of leading to a confusion between the subjective and objective world; these are all purposes which have been represented as essential to art. From our summary investigation of primitive art it has, we hope, appeared how fully we admit the close connection of these purposes with the historical development of art. And it might be shown, if our investigation were pursued into the later stages of development, that art on its highest plane still bears the same relation to concrete utilities as it does on the lowest. Art never ceases to inform, never ceases to please, never ceases to stimulate, never loses something of a magical efficacy. But while acknowledging the importance of all these purposes, we have, on the other hand, to maintain the view which was set out in the psychological chapters of the opening that it is only by assuming an independent art-impulse that we can explain the essential character of art. To make plain the distinction between these two points of view it is advisable to summarise in brief the arguments of either part of our investigation. In the first chapters the writer attempted to show that the art-impulse in its broadest sense must be taken as an outcome of the natural tendency of every feeling-state to manifest itself externally, the effect of such a manifestation being to heighten the pleasure and to relieve the pain. We found in this fact the primary source of art as an individual impulse. But art is essentially social; and this also we explained on psychological grounds. The secondary effect of the exteriorisation of a feeling-state is to awaken similar feelings in other human beings who perceive the manifestation; and their sympathetic feeling acts upon the author of the original manifestation, heightening in him the feeling-state which gave rise to it. Now, all works of art have a common element notwithstanding their diversity. They express, each in their own medium, a mood or moods of the artist; they arise, that is, out of the impulse to expression, which is as primitive as feeling itself. Every man seeks automatically to heighten his feelings of pleasure and to relieve his feelings of pain. The artist is the man who finds that he can gain such enhancement or relief, not only by the direct action of giving expression to his feeling, but also by arousing a kindred feeling in others. Hence originates in him that desire to transmit his moods to an external audience which must be regarded as the simplest and most primordial inducement to artistic production. And also as a further means of realising the same purpose there arises the endeavour to give the artistic product that is to say, the externalised expression of his mood a form which may facilitate the revival of the original state in an ever wider circle of sympathisers. Thus from the reflex outlet for a strong emotional pressure we are led to a deliberate creation, in which the intellectual and volitional elements preponderate increasingly over the automatic, emotional impulse. But from this gain in consciousness there does not result any change in the essential character of the artistic activity. However great the difference between the highest forms of art, such as, for instance, a drama or a sculpture, and the primitive dance-pantomime, the underlying impulse is still the same in both cases. Perpetuation that is, expression which is addressed to a fictitious audience can only be explained by reference to the enhancing and relieving effects which man has experienced as results of emotional transmission. And all the intentional activities, the artistic composition, the artistic technique, and so on, by which perpetuation is secured can thus be regarded as subservient to the emotionalistic purpose. Moreover, these same activities, however unemotional they may be in themselves, will enable the artist to extort an increased emotional value from his motives; for instance, the greater a mans skill in suggesting the peculiar thrill of colour, the greater will be his pleasure in colour itself. Technical excellency, which to the outsider is a cold and neutral thing, may thus to the artist and to the intelligent critic be full of expressional significance. From whichever point of view we may look at art, we shall have to interpret its central and essential characteristics in terms of feeling. In this way we can account for it as a self-sufficing, or as we have said, autotelic activity. And in this way only can we explain the strength of that compelling force which urges an artist to an exertion from which he derives no external utility. But it cannot be contended that primitive human nature furnishes not only the impulse to expression but also the medium. The artist in man had the feeling; he had to discover a way to exteriorise it. Nearest perhaps to primitive art lie the immediate manifestations by regulated gesture and regulated sounds of the voice, which are also in their highest development the most potent means for transmitting an emotion. Yet the different utilities of life offered also other means as it were, words of a language in which the feeling could express itself and transmit itself from mind to mind. The man who used drawing as a means of communicating thoughts could express in a drawing the terror which a beast inspired or the delight he had derived from watching its movements. And just as the purpose of imparting information whether by word or image afforded a natural medium through which the art-impulse could work to its own ends, so also the purpose of propitiation afforded in dance or decoration something which might be diverted from its original object and be used with the single intention of expressing, for instance, the dancers mood. Similarly each of the other purposes that have been discussed or alluded to afforded, as it were, a concrete material for art a shape in which the primitive impulse to gesture could embody and develop itself. And beyond the fact that art has been obliged to avail itself of media which have originally been called into existence by utilitarian, non-sthetic needs, there lies another fact. To these external origins we can also trace some of the most important qualities which we appreciate in a work of art. In this way it is open to us to explain how several of the virtues of art, as we know it, may be derived from the primitive needs which it subserved; how, for instance, the lucidity of art may find its explanation in arts use for conveying information; how the sensuous and attractive qualities of all art may be traced to the need for propitiating favour; how the power that resides in art to brace and stimulate the mind may be transmitted from the days when the artist was appointed to nerve his fellows for work or war. And, lastly, it might be argued that a most characteristic quality of art, the imagination, which is in a sense faith in the reality of the unreal (whether native to the human mind or not), may have been immensely heightened by the use of art for purposes of magic, which fuses the visible and the invisible. There is thus suggested a further point. We were able to derive those qualities of artistic composition, which in all sthetic systems have been insisted on as the most primordial, from the distinctive qualities of the self-sufficing art-impulse, by showing how the unity, the concentration, and the subordination of parts to a whole correspond to the unity of a feeling-state which it is the object of the art-impulse to convey and to perpetuate in its entirety.""","""Function and purpose of art""","1885","""Art, in its various forms, serves a multitude of functions and purposes in society, spanning across cultures, histories, and disciplines. From visual arts to performing arts, music to literature, art plays a significant role in shaping our world and individual experiences. Understanding the function and purpose of art provides insight into its profound impact on human life and civilization.  One primary function of art is its role in self-expression and communication. Artists use their creativity and imagination to convey emotions, thoughts, and ideas that may be difficult to express through words alone. Through art, individuals can communicate their innermost feelings, beliefs, and experiences, allowing for a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them. This form of self-expression can be therapeutic, serving as a means of catharsis and emotional release for both the artist and the audience.  Art also serves as a reflection of society and culture. Artists often draw inspiration from their environment, social issues, political events, and cultural heritage, creating works that document and comment on the world they live in. Art can challenge societal norms, provoke thought, and spark conversations about important issues, serving as a powerful tool for social change and activism. By reflecting the values, beliefs, and concerns of a society, art provides a lens through which we can better understand our past, present, and future.  Moreover, art has the profound ability to evoke emotions and stimulate the senses. Whether through a moving piece of music, a captivating painting, or a powerful performance, art has the power to elicit feelings of joy, sadness, awe, or introspection. These emotional responses can create connections between individuals, bridging cultural divides and fostering empathy and understanding. Art has the unique ability to speak to the human experience on a universal level, transcending language and cultural barriers.  In addition to its emotional impact, art also serves a practical purpose in preserving history and heritage. Through art, we can preserve and commemorate important events, traditions, and stories that might otherwise be lost to time. Artifacts, paintings, sculptures, and other forms of artistic expression serve as tangible links to our past, allowing future generations to learn from and appreciate the achievements and struggles of those who came before them. Art acts as a visual and sensory archive of human history, ensuring that our collective memories endure.  Furthermore, art plays a crucial role in education and personal growth. Through engaging with art, individuals can develop critical thinking skills, creativity, and cultural awareness. Art education fosters a range of skills, from problem-solving and collaboration to self-expression and confidence. By exposing individuals to diverse artistic styles, movements, and traditions, art can broaden perspectives, cultivate empathy, and nurture a lifelong appreciation for creativity and beauty.  Art also serves as a form of escapism and entertainment, providing solace, inspiration, and enjoyment in our daily lives. Whether through a visit to a museum, a concert, a play, or a novel, art offers a temporary reprieve from the pressures and monotony of everyday existence. Engaging with art allows us to explore new worlds, perspectives, and experiences, stimulating our imagination and enriching our lives with beauty and wonder.  In conclusion, the function and purpose of art are manifold, encompassing self-expression, communication, reflection of society, emotional resonance, preservation of history, education, entertainment, and more. Art serves as a powerful medium through which we can connect with ourselves and others, make sense of the world around us, and leave a lasting legacy for future generations. By recognizing and appreciating the diverse functions of art, we can gain a deeper understanding of its profound impact on our lives and society as a whole.""","728"
"Manucy Albert C ","""On his way to Florida, Cendoya stopped at Havana, looking for skilled workmen--masons and lime burners. There he found an engineer, Ignacio Daza. It was on August, 671, that the first workman began to draw his pay. By the time the mosquitoes were sluggish in the cooler fall weather, the coquina pits on Anastasia Island were open, and two big limekilns were being built just north of the old fort. The carpenters put up a palm-thatched shelter at the quarries; they built a dozen large, square-end dugouts and laid rafts over them for hauling stone for the fortification and firewood and oyster shells for the limekilns; and they built boxes, handbarrows, and lime in the two storehouses, and the great piles of both hewn and rough stone were a welcome sight to the people of St. Augustine. Though it was only preparation for the main job, great obstacles had already been overcome. Very little masonry had ever been done in the presidio, and, with the exception of the imported artisans, the workmen had to be trained. Even the imported ones had much to learn about coquina, the natural shellrock peculiar to this section of Florida. Coquina is nothing more than broken sea shells cemented together by their own lime. Where the layer of shells has been under great pressure, the rock is solid and hard; where pressure has been less, the stone is coarse and easily crumbled. The men had to become expert in grading the stone, for only the hardest and finest rock could go into the fortification. There was also a shortage of common labor. When there should have been 5/80 men to keep the 5/8 artisans working at top speed--0 in the quarries and hauling stone, 0 for gathering oyster shells and helping at the kilns, and another 0 for digging the foundation trenches, carrying the baskets of sand, and mixing mortar--it was hard to get as many as 00 laborers on the job. Indians from three Nations, the day, plus rations of maize--but he was not good labor, for by nature the Indian was unfit for heavy work on a European-style fortification. A brave might play the bone-breaking game of Indian ball for a full day, but he could not stand up under the 'day-in, day-out,' grinding, back-straining labor of the quarries. Not all the Indians, however, were common laborers. A half dozen developed into carpenters, and though they did not receive the top wage of 0 to 2 reales, they seemed well pleased with their reales--which was twice what apprentice carpenters earned. In addition to Indian labor, there were a few Spanish peons who were paid reales per day, a few of the Crown's Negro slaves, and a number of convicts, either from the local presidio or sent from Caribbean ports. The convicts served terms of varying length, depending upon the nature of their crimes. A typical convict might have been the Spaniard caught smuggling English goods into the colony, and he was condemned to years' labor on the fortifications at St. Augustine. If he tried to escape, the term was doubled and he faced the grim prospect of being sent to a fever-infested African presidio to work it out. Spanish skilled labor included the military engineer, Ignacio Daza, who was paid the top wage of pesos per day. Daza died within a year of his arrival in Florida, so the Crown paid only the surprisingly small sum of 46 engineering services in starting the greatest of Spanish Florida fortifications. Of the artisans, there were Lorenzo Lagones, master of construction, and a pair of master masons, each of whom received the master workman's wage of 0 day. In addition there were masons at 2 reales, stonecutters at the same rate, and a dozen carpenters whose pay ranged from to 2 reales per working day. There were few men for the job in hand, and to speed the work along Governor Cendoya had to be ingenious and resourceful. Constantly on the lookout for labor, he seized the opportunity of using prisoners from the Carolina Colony, and, ironically enough, they were of exceptional help in building this defense against their own countrymen. Back in 670, a vessel bound for Charleston Harbor accidentally put in at Santa Catalina Mission, the Spanish frontier post near the Savannah River. William Carr and John Rivers were captured. A rescue expedition set out from Charleston, and when the sloop arrived at the Mission, Joseph Bailey and John Collins took a blustering message ashore. For their pains, they were dispatched with Rivers and Carr to St. Augustine. There, from time to time, they were joined by other English prisoners. The Governor did not long hesitate in putting them to work. Three of the prisoners turned out to be masons, and the Spanish form of their names--Bernardo on the pay rolls. Some of the Englishmen entered into the life of the presidio as permanent residents. At least one of them took a Florida bride. Although the Spanish were cautious in depending too much upon the fealty of these Englishmen to the Spanish Crown, there was little occasion to denounce their unwillingness to serve. John Collins especially pleased the Spanish officials. He could burn more lime in a week than Spanish workmen could in twice the time, and what was also to the point, as a prisoner he had to be paid only reales instead of the 0 due a master workman. This Juan Calens appeared to like St. Augustine. He rose steadily in the Crown's employ from master of the kilns to quarry master. Next he took charge of the dugouts, the provisions, and the convicts. Eventually he held even the important office of pilot from St. Augustine to Charleston. Royal recognition of his zeal and loyalty was the culmination of his 9 years or more of service in the presidio. Another unusual case developed a few years later. Some leagues north of St. Augustine, 1 Englishmen were captured. All of them except one Ransom were committed to the galleys. Ransom was to be hanged. On the appointed day this man ascended the scaffold. The hangman put the noose about his neck. The trap opened. The rope jerked taut, then broke. Down tumbled Ransom, safe and sound. While the onlookers marveled, the friars took it as an act of God and led Ransom to sanctuary in the Convent of San Francisco. Word reached the Governor that this man was an ingenious fellow, an artillerist, a carpenter, and, what was most remarkable, a maker of 'artificial fires.'""","""Labor and Construction for Fortifications""","1406","""Labor and construction for fortifications have played a crucial role throughout history, shaping the defense of cities, countries, and empires. From ancient civilizations to modern times, fortifications have been essential for protection, defense, and strategic military purposes. The construction of fortifications involves intricate planning, skilled labor, and strategic foresight. In this comprehensive exploration, we delve into the significance of labor and construction for fortifications, examining their evolution, techniques, and impact on military architecture.  The history of fortifications dates back to ancient times when civilizations built walls, ramparts, and structures to defend their territories. Labor was a key component in the construction of these fortifications, often involving large numbers of workers, craftsmen, and engineers. The labor required for fortifications varied depending on the scale and complexity of the project. Skilled workers such as stonemasons, carpenters, and laborers were essential for tasks like quarrying, shaping stones, mixing mortar, and erecting walls. The coordination of labor was crucial for efficiency and quality in construction.  Construction techniques for fortifications evolved over time, reflecting advancements in engineering, architecture, and military strategy. Ancient fortifications like the Great Wall of China, the walls of Jericho, and the Roman fortresses showcased innovative construction methods using materials like stone, brick, and earthworks. Labor-intensive processes such as quarrying, transporting heavy stones, and placing them with precision were fundamental to creating durable fortifications. The expertise of skilled laborers in shaping and fitting stones together ensured the strength and stability of the structures.  Medieval fortifications further refined construction techniques, introducing features like battlements, moats, drawbridges, and towers. Labor for medieval fortifications was organized through guilds and overseen by master builders who supervised different aspects of construction. Masons specialized in stonecutting and carving intricate designs, while laborers handled tasks like digging trenches, filling earthworks, and carrying building materials. The coordination between laborers and craftsmen was essential for constructing formidable fortresses that could withstand sieges and attacks.  The Renaissance period saw a renaissance in fortification design, with bastions, star-shaped forts, and angled walls becoming prominent features. Labor and construction for these fortifications became more sophisticated, incorporating geometric principles, artillery defense systems, and underground tunnels. Skilled labor was crucial for executing complex architectural plans, with engineers like Vauban in France and Michelangelo in Italy revolutionizing fortification design. The labor force for Renaissance fortifications included mathematicians, architects, laborers, and soldiers working in harmony to create impregnable defenses.  The Industrial Revolution brought significant changes to labor and construction for fortifications, with the use of mechanized tools, steam power, and iron reinforcements transforming the building process. Fortifications during this period adopted new materials like concrete, steel, and reinforced masonry, enhancing durability and adaptability. Skilled laborers operated machinery, constructed railways for transporting materials, and implemented assembly-line techniques for mass production. The integration of technology and labor resulted in faster construction times and more resilient fortifications.  In modern times, labor and construction for fortifications continue to evolve with advancements in materials, machinery, and digital technology. Contemporary fortifications often incorporate high-tech features such as surveillance systems, drones, and smart materials that enhance security and monitoring capabilities. Labor for modern fortifications includes a diverse workforce of engineers, architects, technicians, and construction workers who collaborate to build structures that meet the demands of 21st-century defense needs. The integration of sustainable practices, green technologies, and modular construction methods also influence the labor and construction of modern fortifications.  Labor and construction for fortifications play a crucial role in shaping military architecture, urban planning, and historical heritage. The legacy of fortifications embodies the ingenuity, craftsmanship, and strategic foresight of civilizations past and present. The labor-intensive processes involved in building fortifications serve as a testament to human innovation, perseverance, and adaptability in the face of challenges. Whether ancient walls or modern bunkers, fortifications stand as physical manifestations of defense, security, and the enduring partnership between labor and construction in shaping the built environment.""","833"
"Windle Bertram Coghill Alan Sir","""What he said concerned fossils, then beginning to puzzle the scientific world of the day. Confronted with these objects and living, as he did, in an unscientific age, when the seven days of creation were interpreted as periods of twenty-four hours each and the universality of the Noachian deluge was accepted by everybody, it would have been something like a miracle if he had at once fathomed the true meaning of the shark's teeth, elephant's bones, and other fossil remains which came under his notice. His idea was that all these things were mere concretions 'generated by fermentation in the spots where they were found,' as he very quaintly and even absurdly put it. The accusation, however, is not that Fallopius made a mistake--as many another man has done--but that he deliberately expressed an opinion which he did not hold and did so from religious motives. Of course, this includes the idea that he knew what the real explanation was, for had he not known it, he could not have been guilty of making a false statement. There is no evidence whatever that Fallopius ever had so much as a suspicion of the real explanation, nor, it may be added, had any other man of science for the century which followed his death. Then there arose another Catholic churchman, Nicolaus once been parts of living animals.' One may feel quite certain that if Stensen had not been a Catholic ecclesiastic this notice would have run--and far more truthfully--'Cautiously at first, until he felt that the facts at his disposal made his position quite secure, and then more boldly, etc. etc.' What in the ordinary man of science is caution, becomes cowardice in the Catholic. We shall find another example of this in the case of cited as that of a man who believed all that Darwin believed and one hundred years before Darwin, and who yet was afraid to say it because of the Church to which he belonged. This mistake is partly due to that lamentable ignorance of Catholic teaching, not to say that lamentable incapacity for clear thinking, on these matters, which afflicts some non-Catholic writers. Let us take an example from an eminently fairly written book, in which, dealing with Buffon, the author says: 'I cannot agree with those who think that Buffon was an out-and-out evolutionist, who concealed his opinions for fear of the Church. No doubt he did trim his sails--the palpably insincere Mais non, il est certain par la revelation que tous les animaux ont egalement participe a la grace de la creation, following hard upon the too bold hypothesis of the origin of all species from a single one, is proof of it.' Of course it is nothing of the kind, for, whatever Buffon may have meant, and none but himself could tell us, it is perfectly clear that whether creation was immediate, every created thing would participate in the grace of creation, which is just the point which the writer from whom the quotation has been made has missed. The same writer furnishes us with the real explanation of Buffon's attitude when he says that Buffon was 'too sane and matter-of-fact a thinker to go much beyond his facts, and his evolution doctrine remained always tentative.' Buffon, like many another man, from St. Augustine down to his own times, considered the transformist explanation of living nature. He saw that it unified and simplified the conceptions of species and that there were certain facts which seemed strongly to support it. But he does not seem to have thought that they were sufficient to establish it and he puts forward his views in the tentative manner which has just been suggested. The fact is that those who father the accusations with which we have been dealing either do not know, or scrupulously conceal their knowledge, that what they proclaim to be scientific cowardice is really scientific caution, a thing to be lauded and not to be decried. Let us turn to apply the considerations with which we have been concerned to the case of Galileo, to which generally misunderstood affair we must very briefly allude, since it is the standby of anti-Catholic controversialists. Monsignor Benson, in connection with the quotation recently cited, proclaimed himself 'a violent defender of the Cardinals against Galileo.' Perhaps no one will be surprised at his attitude, but those who are not familiar with his Life and Letters will certainly be surprised to learn that Huxley, after examining into the question, 'arrived at the conclusion that the Pope and the College of Cardinals had rather the best of it.' None the less it is the stock argument. Father Hull, S. J., whose admirable, outspoken, and impartial study of the case should be on everybody's bookshelves, freely admits that the Roman Congregations made a mistake in this matter and thus takes up a less favourable position towards them than even the violently anti-Catholic Huxley. No one will deny that the action of the Congregation was due to a desire to prevent simple persons from having their faith upset by a theory which seemed at the time to contradict the teaching of the Bible. Remember that it was only a theory and that, when it was put forward, and indeed for many years afterwards, it was not only a theory, but one supported by no sufficient evidence. It was not in fact until many years after Galileo's death that final and convincing evidence as to the accuracy of his views was laid before the scientific world. There can be but little doubt that if Galileo had been content to discuss his theory with other men of science, and not to lay it down as a matter of proved fact--which, as we have seen, it was not--he would never have been condemned. Whilst we may admit, with Father Hull, that a mistake was made in this case, we may urge, with Cardinal Newman, that it is the only case in which such a thing has happened--surely a remarkable fact. It is not for want of opportunities. Father Hull very properly cites various cases where a like difficulty might possibly have arisen, but where, as a matter of fact, it has not. For example, the geographical universality of the Deluge was at one time, and that not so very long ago, believed to be asserted by the Bible; while, on the other hand, geologists seemed to be able to show, and in the event did show, that such a view was scientifically untenable. The attention of theologians having been called to this matter, and a further study made of passages which until then had probably attracted but little notice, and quite certainly had never been considered from the new point of view, it became obvious that the meaning which had been attached to the passages in question was not the necessary meaning, but on the contrary, a strained interpretation of the words.""","""Science and Religion Conflict""","1399","""The relationship between science and religion has been a long-standing debate that continues to spark discussions, controversies, and reflections on the nature of human understanding and belief systems. Throughout history, these two fields of knowledge have often been perceived as conflicting disciplines, with tensions arising from differing methodologies, beliefs, and explanations about the natural world and human existence. While some view science and religion as incompatible worldviews that are fundamentally irreconcilable, others argue for a more harmonious relationship between the two. In this exploration, we delve into the origins of the perceived conflict between science and religion, examine key points of contention, consider attempts at reconciliation, and ponder the implications for contemporary society and future dialogue.  The perceived conflict between science and religion can be traced back to historical and cultural contexts where religious authorities held significant power and influence over knowledge production and interpretation. During the Middle Ages, for example, the dominance of the Catholic Church in Western Europe often stifled scientific inquiry that challenged established religious doctrines. The trial of Galileo Galilei by the Catholic Church in the 17th century for advocating heliocentrism—an idea that the Earth revolves around the Sun—highlights the clash between scientific discoveries and religious orthodoxy. Such episodes have led to a perception of science as a threat to religious belief systems, and conversely, religion as a hindrance to scientific progress.  Fundamentally, the conflict between science and religion arises from differing methodologies and epistemologies. Science relies on empirical evidence, experimentation, observation, and the scientific method to understand the natural world, while religion often draws on faith, revelation, scripture, tradition, and personal experience to make sense of existence and the divine. The tension between empirical evidence and faith-based beliefs can create a dichotomy that pits scientific explanations against religious truths, fueling debates on evolution, cosmology, and the origin of the universe.  One of the fundamental points of contention between science and religion is the question of origins. The theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century, challenged traditional religious narratives of creation, leading to debates on the compatibility of evolution with religious beliefs. Similarly, cosmological theories about the Big Bang and the age of the universe have raised questions about the role of a divine creator in shaping the cosmos. These scientific discoveries and theories have posed challenges to religious worldviews that assert a literal interpretation of sacred texts and a direct divine intervention in the natural world.  Despite the apparent conflicts, there have been attempts to reconcile science and religion through various frameworks, such as theistic evolution, intelligent design, and process theology. Theistic evolution proposes that evolution is a means through which a divine creator operates, integrating scientific explanations with religious beliefs about creation. Intelligent design suggests that certain features of the natural world are best explained by an intelligent designer rather than natural selection alone, advocating for the presence of a higher power in the universe. Process theology posits that God is a dynamic and evolving force in the cosmos, engaging with the world through ongoing processes of creativity and emergence.  Moreover, many religious traditions have adapted to scientific discoveries and theories by interpreting sacred texts metaphorically or symbolically, rather than insisting on literal interpretations. For instance, some Christian theologians view the Genesis creation narrative as allegorical rather than historical, allowing for a more nuanced understanding that accommodates scientific insights about the origins of life and the universe. This interpretative flexibility enables individuals to engage with both scientific knowledge and religious beliefs without necessarily perceiving them as mutually exclusive.  In contemporary society, the relationship between science and religion remains a complex and evolving terrain. While tensions persist in certain contexts, there is also a growing recognition of the complementary roles that science and religion can play in shaping human values, ethics, and worldviews. Science offers empirical knowledge, technological advancements, and critical thinking skills that enhance our understanding of the natural world and drive innovation. Religion, on the other hand, provides moral guidance, existential meaning, and community support that address spiritual and ethical dimensions of human life.  Interdisciplinary dialogue and engagement between scientists, theologians, philosophers, and ethicists have led to fruitful discussions on topics such as bioethics, environmental stewardship, and consciousness studies. These conversations highlight the potential for collaboration between science and religion in addressing complex ethical dilemmas, promoting environmental sustainability, and exploring the mysteries of human consciousness. By recognizing the value of both scientific inquiry and spiritual reflection, individuals and communities can cultivate a more holistic approach to knowledge that embraces the richness of diverse perspectives.  In conclusion, the conflict between science and religion is a multifaceted and nuanced issue that reflects the complexities of human understanding, belief systems, and cultural history. While historical tensions and epistemological differences have fueled debates and misunderstandings between the two realms of knowledge, there are also opportunities for dialogue, reconciliation, and mutual enrichment. By embracing humility, curiosity, and openness to multiple ways of knowing, we can foster a more integrated worldview that bridges the insights of science and the wisdom of religious traditions. Ultimately, a thoughtful and respectful engagement with the intersections of science and religion can illuminate new pathways for deeper understanding, interconnectedness, and meaning in our shared quest for truth and transcendence.""","1033"
"Shelton Louise 1867 ","""Winter protection is not a matter of importance and Pansies need but an ordinary covering of leaves. An extreme of cold, which is rare, might bring disaster to the leaf-covered Canterbury Bell in the open, but this is one of the gambles in garden life. In Maryland, as generally elsewhere in this section, spring and June gardens prevail. The Crocus season opens in early March; Daffodils follow a little later; late Tulips and German Iris come near May; Sweet William and Peonies about May 0; and soon after the Delphiniums and Hollyhocks appear. Spring work begins three weeks earlier than in the latitude of Long Island, and frost may finish the persistent Marigold near November; but, as elsewhere, by that time green life has had its day, vitality has been spent, and nothing satisfactory can be expected of any but the hardy late Chrysanthemum. There is another region of this State to be separately accounted for that has been more or less overlooked, and where the climate is more inviting to summer gardening. From near Snow Hill, on the narrow peninsula south of Delaware, a resident writes in part: 'As to this eastern shore, its flowers, climate, etc., too much cannot be said in its praise. The wonder is that this section has been overlooked by wealthy people seeking homes. With proper planting one can have flowers in the garden ten months of the year. During the winter Holly and other choice evergreens give plenty of color for the lawns.' The distance across between the Chesapeake Bay and the sea is about thirty-five miles. Near the shore the place has a climate of its own, and summer gardens need not wilt as they do inland, providing they can at times be moderately sprinkled. Usually the summer climate is pleasant with an evening sea-breeze in hot weather; sometimes a prolonged dry spell causes many things to suffer, but as a rule all sorts of flowering plants succeed--Roses, China Asters, and bulbous plants especially grow to perfection. The illustrations representing Maryland are gathered from the vicinity of Baltimore, the particular garden region of the State. Hampton is the oldest of them all, being an entailed estate and one of two old manor-houses in Maryland still extant. A severe cold snap a few winters past did great damage to the Box, which in consequence had to be cut back, but time, it is hoped, may restore its original form and beauty. The spring view of one of Hampton's gardens was taken recently prior to the period of fullest bloom. This charming Box-edged parterre, with its fine surroundings and associations, is possibly the best-known in the South. Evergreen-on-Avenue is delightfully located on the outskirts of Baltimore, where many old country-seats abound. The lower garden only is discernible in the illustration, showing the dignity and charm of an evergreen garden, relieved by a massing of color in narrow beds which form a setting to the clipped Box and other shrubs. The upper garden is full of bloom and kept chiefly as a place for cutting-flowers. Some of the paths on this estate are edged with broad bands of Ivy. The wild garden at Roland Park is a work of art too intricately devised to be treated satisfactorily by picture or pen. The eye can only absorb and memory retain it, but description will ever fail to present it. At every turn there is a delightful surprise, at every season it is lovely; even January finds it so dressed in evergreen that winter seems far away. A few years ago the hillside was a wooded and abandoned stone-quarry until purchased for the purpose of creating a place of beauty out of chaos. An inspired imagination only could have wrought this miracle. The old Indian name for the Cylburn plantation was Cool Waters; it covers two hundred acres, about five miles beyond Baltimore. Cylburn House is of stone with broad verandas, and stands majestically on a high plateau, surrounded by gardens, shrubbery, and an extensive lawn, which is fringed by a beautiful primeval forest that stretches away on three sides to the valley below. The garden is one of the old-fashioned rambling kind, made lovely with a combination of tall shrubs and flowers and occasional trees. The fair little glimpse of a section of the garden at Ingleside breathes of spring perfume and color, with that indescribable sense of peace pervading especially a little enclosed garden where good taste and harmony prevail. So great is the impression of seclusion produced by the attractive picture that the farmer's cottage in the near background seems almost disconnected from this inviting spot. The four white standard Wistarias are remarkable enough to demand special attention. The beds are early filled with the Tulips of both periods, blooming in company with the Wistaria. Annuals follow, and the place is kept in long bloom under the careful supervision of the owner. At The Blind, Havre de Grace, on the Chesapeake, is a charming and typically Southern garden with ancient Box hedges for a background, and filled with the bloom of many old-fashioned hardy plants and shrubs. The property of two hundred acres is partly under cultivation and partly covered with Holly and ancient trees. Around the gray stone mansion in springtime the place is like a fairy-land, with hundreds of blossoming shrubs and fruit trees. Originally the land belonged to the Stumpp family, who acquired it by grant from one of the early English governors. It is now in the possession of a New Yorker, who keeps it as a shooting-preserve and stock-farm. VIII Virginia was the first of the States to adopt a luxurious mode of living. Its early men and women, so recently English, were not many of them of the strictly Puritan type, but rather the ease and pleasure loving class, and shortly their fertile plantations, developed by countless slaves, yielded rich results, and Virginia, followed soon by the neighboring States, became famous for homes and gardens on an extensive scale. One of the earliest and best of these estates was Mount Vernon, so well preserved and yet so familiar as not to need an introduction or even a space in this book. Brandon, Westover, Shirley, Berkeley, Castle Hill, and others on the River James, as well as some of the splendid places in the 'hill country,' have been renovated in recent years and should be considered among the treasures of America. Mr. William du Pont is the fortunate present owner of Montpelier, the home of President Madison, in Orange County, and situated between Charlottesville and Richmond. This splendid garden was planned by Mr. Madison soon after 794. To quote Mr. Capen: 'On the plan of our House of Representatives, it is made in a series of horseshoe terraces leading down to a flat rectangular stretch of ground. The walk from the entrance to the garden passes first under a charming rustic arbor, and then through a dense Box hedge in which some of the bushes have grown so high that their branches form an arch overhead. and when one emerges from the arch of Box he finds spread before him in panorama the entire garden. the Box-edged aisle down its centre and every bed in flower. It must have been a rare garden, for trees and shrubs sent to Mr. Madison by admirers from all over the world were jealously guarded and nurtured.' At Rose Hill the terraced garden, with its distant view of hills and valley, is among the best-known places of this section. Here the flowers, most carefully tended, bloom considerably during the period from April to October, which is unusually prolonged for a Southern garden. Flowering plants and clipped evergreens border the broad, grassy terraces and an air of simple stateliness pervades this charming Virginia garden. Delightful indeed is the spacious formal garden at Meadowbrook Manor, on the James River. So cleverly arranged is the combination of trees and flowers that the latter do not suffer from near association with the trees--many of which are evergreens combining with the Box border to gladden the winter garden with summer green, and giving the livable, homey sense to this lovely enclosure in summer-time. In the old days the property was known as Sequin and belonged to relatives of Sir Thomas Gates of the same name. Upon this land in 619 were operated the first iron-works in the country. Characteristic of the gardens of the older period is the lovely view of the garden on the Valentine place overgrown and ripe as only a garden can be that has lived through the years; unpretentious, yet richer in that mellowed growth than the most costly planting of modern date. In Virginia, mountains cover a part of the State, and the temperature necessarily varies according to locality. The climate, at least of Albemarle County, brings out the Crocuses in February or early March; winter Jessamine in early February, sometimes January; Daffodils in mid-March; Lily-of-the-Valley and Cottage Tulip early in April; German Iris in mid-April. Roses and Sweet William appear in early May; Delphinium in late May; Hollyhocks in early June; Phlox, July.""","""Gardening in Maryland and Virginia""","1884","""Gardening in Maryland and Virginia encompasses a rich tapestry of horticultural traditions and challenges, influenced by the region's unique climate, soil conditions, and cultural heritage. From the picturesque landscapes of the Chesapeake Bay to the rolling hills of the Shenandoah Valley, these two states offer a diverse range of opportunities for both novice and seasoned gardeners to cultivate stunning gardens brimming with native plants, vibrant blooms, and bountiful harvests.  Both Maryland and Virginia share a similar USDA hardiness zone, ranging from zone 6 to 7, with some areas classified as zone 8 in the southern regions. This moderate climate allows for a wide variety of plants to thrive, from luscious perennials to thriving vegetables. However, the states also present unique challenges such as hot, humid summers, occasional droughts, and the risk of hurricanes and tropical storms. Understanding and adapting to these climatic factors is crucial for successful gardening in the region.  One of the key considerations for gardeners in Maryland and Virginia is soil quality. The soils in these states vary from sandy loam to clay, which can impact drainage, nutrient availability, and overall plant health. Conducting a soil test to determine pH levels and nutrient content is essential for selecting the right plants and implementing appropriate amendments to ensure optimal growth.  Native plants play a vital role in Maryland and Virginia gardens, not only for their beauty but also for their ecological benefits. Native species are well-adapted to the local conditions and support pollinators, birds, and other wildlife. Incorporating native plants like Virginia bluebells (Mertensia virginica), black-eyed Susans (Rudbeckia hirta), and cardinal flowers (Lobelia cardinalis) can enhance biodiversity and create a more sustainable garden ecosystem.  In addition to native plants, vegetable gardening holds a special place in the hearts of many Maryland and Virginia residents. The states boast a long growing season, starting as early as March and extending well into the fall. Popular crops for the region include tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, squash, and a variety of herbs. Succession planting, mulching, and proper irrigation techniques are essential for maximizing yields and warding off common pests and diseases like tomato blight and cucumber beetles.  For those gardeners looking to add a touch of elegance to their outdoor spaces, ornamental gardens offer endless possibilities. Whether designing a formal English garden with neatly trimmed hedges and symmetrical plantings or creating a cottage garden bursting with color and texture, the region's gardening enthusiasts can draw inspiration from the historic estates and botanical gardens that dot the landscape.  Container gardening is another popular option for urban dwellers or those with limited space. From vibrant annuals and compact vegetables to dwarf fruit trees and herbs, containers provide flexibility and mobility, allowing gardeners to experiment with different plant combinations and styles to suit their taste and space constraints.  When it comes to maintaining a healthy garden, integrated pest management (IPM) practices are crucial for minimizing the use of synthetic chemicals and promoting natural pest control methods. Companion planting, crop rotation, beneficial insects, and trap crops can help deter pests and diseases while fostering a more balanced and resilient garden ecosystem.  Community gardens and local gardening clubs offer opportunities for like-minded individuals to share knowledge, resources, and camaraderie. These communal spaces not only enrich the social fabric of neighborhoods but also provide a platform for collective learning and hands-on experience for gardeners of all skill levels.  As we look to the future of gardening in Maryland and Virginia, sustainability and conservation will undoubtedly play a central role. Embracing water-saving techniques like drip irrigation, capturing rainwater, composting organic matter, and selecting drought-tolerant plants are steps towards creating more resilient and environmentally friendly gardens that can withstand the challenges of a changing climate.  In conclusion, gardening in Maryland and Virginia is a rewarding journey filled with opportunities to connect with nature, explore local flora and fauna, and savor the beauty of the changing seasons. By embracing the region's unique characteristics, incorporating native plants, and adopting sustainable practices, gardeners can cultivate thriving landscapes that not only delight the senses but also contribute to the preservation of the natural heritage of these two states.""","848"
"Blackwell Elizabeth","""These fundamental principles are--First, the independence, freedom, and perfection of the individual. Second, the preservation of the race. These two objects are secured to a certain extent in all highly organized creatures; but in the human race provision is made for individual freedom in a much more marked and perfect manner, in accordance with the superior rank of man in creation. The brute, both male and female, is at certain times blindly dominated by the physical impulse of sex. This impulse in the lower animal is a simple imperative instinct, unhesitatingly yielded to, with no preparation or after-thought, with no calculation, shame, triumph, or regret. But it is very different with the human race, as it grows from lower to higher states of society. Thoughts and feelings, social ties and conscience, religious training and the objects of life, all act upon the distinctive mental character of sex; and it is seen that the welfare of a third factor, viz., the child, is inseparably connected with these relations. Its character is thus changed to a very complex faculty. The young man or woman blindly yielding to this power of sexual attraction, against the remonstrance of a high sense of duty, is torn by remorse, and is consciously self-degraded. The influence of the moral element is also strikingly shown by an evil peculiar to the human race, viz., suicide or insanity as the result of unhappy love. The growing power of the mental element over sex in all the higher races of mankind is demonstrated by the ennobling friendships between men and women which increasingly brighten life in our own Anglo-Saxon civilization. The free and friendly intercourse of self-respecting youth of both sexes satisfies the complex wants of early man and womanhood; there is physical as well as mental refreshment in such honourable and natural human intercourse. In the young man or woman, just entered into the full possession of all the human faculties, where the special attraction of two tends towards marriage, this moral or mental predominance is still remarkable. The attraction towards the other sex is rich in mental delights. The passing sight of the object beloved, a word, a look, a smile, will make sunshine in the gloomiest day. The consciousness of spiritual attraction will sustain and guard through long waiting for more complete union. The physical pleasure which attends the caresses of love is a rich endowment of humanity, granted by a beneficent Creative Power. There is nothing necessarily evil in physical pleasure. Though inferior in rank to mental pleasure, it is a legitimate part of our nature, involving always some degree of mental action. The satisfaction which our senses, sight, hearing, touch, etc., derive from all lovely objects adapted to the special sense, indicates that beneficence latent in the cosmic process which enters into the physical manifestation of our present earthly life. The sexual act itself, rightly understood in its compound character, so far from being a necessarily evil thing, is really a Divinely created and altogether righteous fulfilment of the conditions of present life. This act, like all human acts, is subjected to the inexorable rule of moral law. Righteous use brings renewed and increasing satisfaction to the two made one in harmonious union. Unrighteous use produces satiety, coldness, repulsion, and misery to the two remaining apart, through the abuse of a Divine gift. At a public table in the Tyrol I once heard an Austrian officer, a most repulsive spectacle, dying of his vices, boast of his ruined life, and declare that he would take the consequences and live it over again had he the power to do so. This is the insanity of lust. But it illustrates the inseparable union of soul and body in human sex. It is the mental element dominating the physical impulse in man, for evil, which produces that monstrous creation, cold, selfish, and cruel, which is seen only in the man or woman abusing the creative powers of sex. It will thus be seen that in the varieties of degradation of our sexual powers, as well as in their use and ennoblement, it is the predominance of the mental or spiritual element in our nature which is the characteristic fact of human sex. The inventions and abuses of lust, as well as the use and guidance of love, alike prove the striking and important distinction which exists between the sexual organization of man and that of the lower animals. II Equivalent Functions in the Male and Female In examining the characteristics of sex in Man under its dual aspect, male and female, Natures primary or rudimentary aim in establishing sex must be clearly recognised. This aim is the reproduction of the species. Pleasure in sexual congress is an incident depending largely on mental constitution. In the varying ranks of the animal creation it may or may not exist in connection with reproduction; for it is not essential to the one all-important dominating fact in nature, viz., parentage. Reproduction is accomplished in various ways in the widely differing ranks of living creatures. Man, owing to certain general resemblances of physical structure, belongs to the higher class of animals, the Mammalia. In this class the two factors necessary to reproduction, viz., ova and semen or sperm, exist in separate individuals. The ova or seed are formed in the ovaries, two small bodies placed within the pelvis of the female; whilst the sperm or vitalizing fluid is formed in the testes, two small bodies placed outside the pelvis of the male. The organs or parts which produce the ova and semen are strictly analogous in the two sexes. Each part in the female corresponds to a similar part in the male; and at an early period of existence before birth it is impossible to determine whether the sex of the embryo is male or female. Whilst the male and female organs concerned in the production of semen and of ova are parallel and in strict correspondence, there is one striking deficiency in the male structure. The organ essential to the development of the human being, the organ into which the fertilized be brought for growth, is wanting in the male structure. This deficiency or difference between the sexes produces important physiological results. The special part which the male has to perform physically in the all-important reproductive function of sex finishes with the act of sexual congress, but it continues in the female. If conception has taken place, the results of this act become increasingly important. The life of sex, or all that belongs to the life of the race, as distinguished from the existence of the individual, becomes continuously and for a long time inseparable from the womans personal existence. Thus, all the relations of sex form a more important part of the womans than of the mans life. Another important fact in sexual construction must be noted--viz., the nervous connections of the sexual organs. All the parts concerned in reproduction are in close communication with the brain by means of the nervous system and that enlargement of the spinal cord at the base of the brain, the medulla oblongata. If the nervous connection between the generative organs and the brain be severed, no consciousness of those parts will remain. But whilst the natural nervous connection exists, the influence of the brain upon those organs is continually felt, and information as to their changes is sent to the brain. This nerve connection exists from birth, although the formation of ova and not take place until a later date. Keen nervous sensation may, therefore, be perceived at any time after birth, although offspring cannot be produced until the more or less perfect establishment of reproductive power at puberty. It is of great importance to recognise this fact in the education of children. The above general statements respecting the division and correspondence of the sexual organs in the male and female, and their connection with the brain through the nervous system, are true of all the Mammalia, where, as in man, the reproductive power exists in two separate individuals. When, however, we consider the way in which these functions act in the work of reproduction, an important difference is observed between their action in man and in the lower animals. This difference places man physically in a different and superior category from the brute creation. The physiological arrangement of physical sex in man corresponds to the demands made by the increasing complexity of the sentiment of mental sex. As already stated, the two essential features of physical sex are ovulation and sperm-formation. These two important factors in the joint work of reproduction are governed by a different rule in human and in brute life. In man they exist under the rule of continuity and of self-adjustment--i.e., these functions are always existent--but at the same time they adapt themselves to the higher needs of the individual. These two laws under which the functions exist--viz., st, continuity of action; nd, power of self-adjustment--are distinctive marks of superior human sexual function. Both are necessitated by the growth of reason--i.e., by a progressive civilization. This will be understood clearly by dwelling more in detail on the way in which these two essential parts of reproduction--viz., sperm-formation and ovulation--are established in the human race. In reproduction, the ova which are constantly produced in the female require to be fertilized by contact with the semen, which is constantly produced by the male, before they can commence the remarkable series of changes and transformations which result in the formation of the embryo, the rudimentary human being.""","""Human sexuality and moral implications""","1896","""Human sexuality is a multifaceted and complex topic that intertwines biology, psychology, culture, and ethics. The varied expressions of human sexuality have fascinated and sometimes perplexed individuals and societies throughout history. From the fairly recent acceptance of diverse sexual orientations to ongoing debates over reproductive rights and gender identity, human sexuality continues to be a rich and evolving area of study. At the core of discussions surrounding human sexuality are moral implications that can shape societal norms, influence personal beliefs, and impact public policy.  Moral considerations regarding human sexuality often revolve around questions of right and wrong, purity and corruption, and freedom and control. These considerations are deeply intertwined with religious beliefs, cultural values, and individual ethics. The intersection of these factors shapes how societies view and regulate sexuality in various contexts. For centuries, religious teachings have played a significant role in shaping moral attitudes towards sex, often dictating what is deemed acceptable or taboo. In many cultures, traditions and customs have also influenced how sexuality is perceived and practiced.  One of the key areas where moral implications of human sexuality come into play is in the realm of sexual orientation. The acceptance and understanding of diverse sexual orientations such as homosexuality, bisexuality, and pansexuality have evolved over time. While many societies have become more inclusive and supportive of LGBTQ+ individuals, there are still pockets of resistance based on deeply held moral or religious beliefs. This cultural divide can lead to discrimination, stigma, and even violence against individuals with non-heteronormative sexual orientations.  Another area of contention regarding human sexuality is reproductive rights. Debates over issues such as contraception, abortion, and assisted reproductive technologies often center on moral arguments about the sanctity of life, individual autonomy, and societal well-being. Those who advocate for reproductive rights often emphasize the importance of bodily autonomy and the right to make decisions about one's own reproductive health. On the other hand, opponents may believe that certain reproductive practices are morally unacceptable due to religious or ethical reasons.  Gender identity is yet another dimension of human sexuality that raises moral implications. As understanding of gender diversity expands, moral questions arise around issues such as gender expression, gender roles, and transgender rights. Some individuals and communities struggle to reconcile traditional views of gender with the complexities of gender identity. This tension can lead to discrimination, prejudice, and challenges to the rights and dignity of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.  In the realm of sexual behavior, moral considerations often revolve around questions of consent, fidelity, and integrity. Consent is a fundamental aspect of ethical sexual behavior, as it ensures that all parties involved are willing participants. Discussions around issues such as sexual harassment, assault, and coercion underscore the importance of respecting boundaries and upholding the dignity of every individual. Fidelity in relationships is another moral aspect of human sexuality that is often valued for its role in maintaining trust and commitment.  Furthermore, the rise of digital communication and social media has introduced new moral complexities into human sexuality. Issues such as sexting, pornography consumption, and online dating raise questions about privacy, consent, and healthy boundaries. The easy access to explicit content online has prompted discussions about the impact of such material on individuals, relationships, and society as a whole. Balancing freedom of expression with the need to protect individuals from harm is a ongoing moral challenge in the digital age.  In conclusion, human sexuality is a rich and nuanced area of study that encompasses a wide range of behaviors, identities, and moral considerations. As society continues to evolve, so too do attitudes towards sexuality and the ethical questions that surround it. Understanding the moral implications of human sexuality is essential for fostering a more inclusive, compassionate, and respectful society where individuals are free to express their sexuality authentically and without fear of judgment or discrimination. By engaging in thoughtful dialogue, promoting education, and advocating for the rights of all individuals, we can work towards a more ethical and equitable approach to human sexuality in all its diversity and complexity.""","784"
"Tagore Rabindranath","""Over there, on the sky-piercing peaks of Simla, you will find it hard to realise exactly what an important event the coming of the clouds is here, or how many are anxiously looking up to the sky, hailing their advent. I feel a great tenderness for these peasant folk--our ryots--big, helpless, infantile children of Providence, who must have food brought to their very lips, or they are undone. When the breasts of Mother Earth dry up they are at a loss what to do, and can only cry. But no sooner is their hunger satisfied than they forget all their past sufferings. I know not whether the socialistic ideal of a more equal distribution of wealth is attainable, but if not, the dispensation of Providence is indeed cruel, and man a truly unfortunate creature. For if in this world misery must exist, so be it; but let some little loophole, some glimpse of possibility at least, be left, which may serve to urge the nobler portion of humanity to hope and struggle unceasingly for its alleviation. They say a terribly hard thing who assert that the division of the world's production to afford each one a mouthful of food, a bit of clothing, is only an Utopian dream. All these social problems are hard indeed! Fate has allowed humanity such a pitifully meagre coverlet, that in pulling it over one part of the world, another has to be left bare. In allaying our poverty we lose our wealth, and with this wealth what a world of grace and beauty and power is lost to us. But the sun shines forth again, though the clouds are still banked up in the West., 1th May 893. There is another pleasure for me here. Sometimes one or other of our simple, devoted, old ryots comes to see me--and their worshipful homage is so unaffected! How much greater than I are they in the beautiful simplicity and sincerity of their reverence. What if I am unworthy of their veneration--their feeling loses nothing of its value. I regard these grown-up children with the same kind of affection that I have for little children--but there is also a difference. They are more infantile still. Little children will grow up later on, but these big children never. A meek and radiantly simple soul shines through their worn and wrinkled, old bodies. Little children are merely simple, they have not the unquestioning, unwavering devotion of these. If there be any undercurrent along which the souls of men may have communication with one another, then my sincere blessing will surely reach and serve them., 6th May 893. I walk about for an hour on the river bank, fresh and clean after my afternoon bath. Then I get into the new jolly-boat, anchor in mid-stream, and on a bed, spread on the planked over-stern, I lie silently there on my back, in the darkness of the evening. Little S-- sits beside me and chatters away, and the sky becomes more and more thickly studded with stars. Each day the thought recurs to me: Shall I be reborn under this star-spangled sky? Will the peaceful rapture of such wonderful evenings ever again be mine, on this silent Bengal river, in so secluded a corner of the world? Perhaps not. The scene may be changed; I may be born with a different mind. Many such evenings may come, but they may refuse to nestle so trustfully, so lovingly, with such complete abandon, to my breast. Curiously enough, my greatest fear is lest I should be reborn in Europe! For there one cannot recline like this with one's whole being laid open to the infinite above--one is liable, I am afraid, to be soundly rated for lying down at all. I should probably have been hustling strenuously in some factory or bank, or Parliament. Like the roads there, one's mind has to be stone-metalled for heavy traffic--geometrically laid out, and kept clear and regulated. I am sure I cannot exactly say why this lazy, dreamy, self-absorbed, sky-filled state of mind seems to me the more desirable. I feel no whit inferior to the busiest men of the world as I lie here in my jolly-boat. Rather, had I girded up my loins to be strenuous, I might have seemed ever so feeble compared to those chips of old oaken blocks., rd July 893. All last night the wind howled like a stray dog, and the rain still pours on without a break. The water from the fields is rushing in numberless, purling streams to the river. The dripping ryots are crossing the river in the ferryboat, some with their tokas on, others with yam leaves held over their heads. Big cargo-boats are gliding along, the boatman sitting drenched at his helm, the crew straining at the tow-ropes through the rain. The birds remain gloomily confined to their nests, but the sons of men fare forth, for in spite of the weather the world's work must go on. Two cowherd lads are grazing their cattle just in front of my boat. The cows are munching away with great gusto, their noses plunged into the lush grass, their tails incessantly busy flicking off the flies. The raindrops and the sticks of the cowherd boys fall on their backs with the same unreasonable persistency, and they bear both with equally uncritical resignation, steadily going on with their munch, munch, munch. These cows have such mild, affectionate, mournful eyes; why, I wonder, should Providence have thought fit to impose all the burden of man's work on the submissive shoulders of these great, gentle beasts? The river is rising daily. What I could see yesterday only from the upper deck, I can now see from my cabin windows. Every morning I awake to find my field of vision growing larger. Not long since, only the tree-tops near those distant villages used to appear, like dark green clouds. To-day the whole of the wood is visible. Land and water are gradually approaching each other like two bashful lovers. The limit of their shyness has nearly been reached--their arms will soon be round each other's necks. I shall enjoy my trip along this brimful river at the height of the rains. I am fidgeting to give the order to cast off., th July 893. A little gleam of sunlight shows this morning. There was a break in the rains yesterday, but the clouds are banked up so heavily along the skirts of the sky that there is not much hope of the break lasting. It looks as if a heavy carpet of cloud had been rolled up to one side, and at any moment a fussy breeze may come along and spread it over the whole place again, covering every trace of blue sky and golden sunshine. What a store of water must have been laid up in the sky this year. The river has already risen over the low chur-lands, threatening to overwhelm all the standing crops. The wretched ryots, in despair, are cutting and bringing away in boats sheaves of half-ripe rice. As they pass my boat I hear them bewailing their fate. It is easy to understand how heart-rending it must be for cultivators to have to cut down their rice on the very eve of its ripening, the only hope left them being that some of the ears may possibly have hardened into grain. There must be some element of pity in the dispensations of Providence, else how did we get our share of it? But it is so difficult to see where it comes in. The lamentations of these hundreds of thousands of unoffending creatures do not seem to get anywhere. The rain pours on as it lists, the river still rises, and no amount of petitioning seems to have the effect of bringing relief from any quarter. One has to seek consolation by saying that all this is beyond the understanding of man. And yet, it is so vitally necessary for man to understand that there are such things as pity and justice in the world. However, this is only sulking. Reason tells us that creation never can be perfectly happy. So long as it is incomplete it must put up with imperfection and sorrow. It can only be perfect when it ceases to be creation, and is God. Do our prayers dare go so far? The more we think over it, the oftener we come hack to the starting-point--Why this creation at all? If we cannot make up our minds to object to the thing itself, it is futile complaining about its companion, sorrow., th July 893. The flow of village life is not too rapid, neither is it stagnant. Work and rest go together, hand in hand. The ferry crosses to and fro, the passers-by with umbrellas up wend their way along the tow-path, women are washing rice on the split-bamboo trays which they dip in the water, the ryots are coming to the market with bundles of jute on their heads. Two men are chopping away at a log of wood with regular, ringing blows. The village carpenter is repairing an upturned dinghy under a big aswatha tree. A mongrel dog is prowling aimlessly along the canal bank. Some cows are lying there chewing the cud, after a huge meal off the luxuriant grass, lazily moving their ears backwards and forwards, flicking off flies with their tails, and occasionally giving an impatient toss of their heads when the crows perched on their backs take too much of a liberty. The monotonous blows of woodcutter's axe or carpenter's mallet, the splashing of oars, the merry voices of the naked little children at play, the plaintive tune of the ryot's song, the more dominant creaking of the turning oil-mill, all these sounds of activity do not seem out of harmony with murmuring leaves and singing birds, and all combine like moving strains of some grand dream-orchestra, rendering a composition of immense though restrained pathos., 0th July 893. All I have to say about the discussion that is going on over 'silent poets' is that, though the strength of feeling may be the same in those who are silent as in those who are vocal, that has nothing to do with poetry. Poetry is not a matter of feeling, it is the creation of form. Ideas take shape by some hidden, subtle skill at work within the poet.""","""Human struggle and natural elements""","2192","""Human Struggle Against the Elements: A Test of Resilience and Adaptability  Throughout history, humans have faced a relentless battle against the forces of nature. The struggle for survival against the elements has shaped civilizations, cultures, and individuals in profound ways. From extreme weather phenomena to geological upheavals, the natural world poses constant challenges that test human resilience and adaptability. This enduring confrontation with nature has not only shaped our physical environment but has also influenced our societal structures, technological advancements, and philosophical beliefs.  One of the most formidable adversaries humans encounter is the unpredictable and often destructive force of weather. From blistering heatwaves to bone-chilling cold, humanity has had to endure and adapt to a wide range of climatic conditions. In regions prone to hurricanes, tornadoes, or typhoons, communities have learned to fortify their homes, develop early warning systems, and evacuate when necessary. The devastation caused by natural disasters serves as a stark reminder of our vulnerability in the face of nature's wrath, prompting us to innovate and implement strategies to mitigate risks and protect lives.  Moreover, the scarcity or excess of water has been a recurring challenge for many societies. Droughts parch the land, leading to crop failures and food shortages, while floods can devastate entire regions, displacing populations and causing immense suffering. The management of water resources, through irrigation systems, dams, and water conservation practices, has been essential for human survival and development. In arid regions, ancient civilizations like the Mesopotamians or the Egyptians mastered the art of harnessing water for agriculture, allowing their societies to flourish in otherwise inhospitable environments.  Geological forces, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides, also present significant threats to human settlements. The sudden and catastrophic nature of these events can result in immense loss of life and property. Earthquake-prone regions like Japan or California have implemented stringent building codes and early warning systems to reduce the impact of seismic activity. Volcanic eruptions, while destructive, have also enriched the soil and provided fertile grounds for agriculture in regions like Iceland or Indonesia. The delicate balance between the destructive and beneficial aspects of geological forces underscores the complex relationship between humans and the natural world.  Beyond the direct physical impact of natural elements, there is also a psychological and emotional dimension to the human struggle against nature. The awe-inspiring power of hurricanes, the tranquility of a snow-covered landscape, or the fury of a raging wildfire can evoke a range of emotions from fear to wonder. Our connection to the natural world is deeply ingrained in our collective consciousness, shaping our myths, art, and spiritual beliefs. Throughout history, humans have sought to understand and harness the forces of nature through rituals, ceremonies, and scientific inquiry, reflecting our innate desire to control our environment and transcend our limitations.  In contemporary times, the threat of climate change looms large as a reminder of the consequences of human actions on the delicate balance of the planet. Rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events are all manifestations of our unsustainable relationship with nature. The urgent need to address environmental degradation, reduce carbon emissions, and embrace sustainable practices underscores the interconnectedness of humanity with the natural world. The fight against climate change requires a collective effort on a global scale, emphasizing the shared responsibility we have towards preserving the planet for future generations.  Despite the myriad challenges posed by the elements, humans have demonstrated remarkable resilience and ingenuity in the face of adversity. The ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, innovate technological solutions, and cooperate in times of crisis highlights the best of human nature. The lessons learned from our ongoing struggle against the elements serve as a testament to our capacity for growth, cooperation, and evolution as a species.  In conclusion, the human struggle against the elements is a timeless saga that embodies our resilience, adaptability, and interconnectedness with the natural world. From ancient civilizations to modern societies, we have navigated through storms, droughts, earthquakes, and floods, emerging stronger and more enlightened with each trial. As we confront the challenges of climate change and environmental degradation, it is crucial to heed the lessons of the past and embrace sustainable practices that ensure a harmonious coexistence with nature. Ultimately, our ability to overcome adversity and thrive in the face of uncertainty is a testament to the enduring spirit of humanity in its quest for survival and transcendence.""","878"
"Trine Ralph Waldo","""There comes to mind at this moment a friend, a lady well on to eighty years of age. An old lady, some, most people in fact, would call her, especially those who measure age by the number of the seasons that have come and gone since one's birth. But to call our friend old, would be to call black white. She is no older than a girl of twenty-five, and indeed younger, I am glad to say, or I am sorry to say, depending upon the point of view, than many a girl of this age. Seeking for the good in all people and in all things, she has found the good everywhere. The brightness of disposition and of voice that is hers today, that attracts all people to her and that makes her so beautifully attractive to all people, has characterized her all through life. It has in turn carried brightness and hope and courage and strength to hundreds and thousands of people through all these years, and will continue to do so, apparently, for many years yet to come. No fears, no worryings, no hatreds, no jealousies, no sorrowings, no grievings, no sordid graspings after inordinant gain, have found entrance into her realm of thought. As a consequence her mind, free from these abnormal states and conditions, has not externalized in her body the various physical ailments that the great majority of people are lugging about with them, thinking in their ignorance, that they are natural, and that it is all in accordance with the 'eternal order of things' that they should have them. Her life has been one of varied experiences, so that all these things would have found ready entrance into the realm of her mind and so into her life were she ignorant enough to allow them entrance. On the contrary she has been wise enough to recognize the fact that in one kingdom at least she is ruler,--the kingdom of her mind, and that it is hers to dictate as to what shall and what shall not enter there. She knows, moreover, that in determining this she is determining all the conditions of her life. It is indeed a pleasure as well as an inspiration to see her as she goes here and there, to see her sunny disposition, her youthful step, to hear her joyous laughter. Indeed and in truth, Shakspeare knew whereof he spoke when he said,--'It is the mind that makes the body rich.' With great pleasure I watched her but recently as she was walking along the street, stopping to have a word and so a part in the lives of a group of children at play by the wayside, hastening her step a little to have a word with a washerwoman toting her bundle of clothes, stopping for a word with a laboring man returning with dinner pail in hand from his work, returning the recognition from the lady in her carriage, and so imparting some of her own rich life to all with whom she came in contact. And as good fortune would have it, while still watching her, an old lady passed her,--really old, this one, though at least ten or fifteen years younger, so far as the count by the seasons is concerned. Nevertheless she was bent in form and apparently stiff in joint and muscle. Silent in mood, she wore a countenance of long-faced sadness, which was intensified surely several fold by a black, sombre headgear with an immense heavy veil still more sombre looking if possible. Her entire dress was of this description. By this relic-of-barbarism garb, combined with her own mood and expression, she continually proclaimed to the world two things,--her own personal sorrows and woes, which by this very method she kept continually fresh in her mind, and also her lack of faith in the eternal goodness of things, her lack of faith in the love and eternal goodness of the Infinite Father. Wrapped only in the thoughts of her own ailments, and sorrows, and woes, she received and she gave nothing of joy, nothing of hope, nothing of courage, nothing of value to those whom she passed or with whom she came in contact. But on the contrary she suggested to all and helped to intensify in many, those mental states all too prevalent in our common human life. And as she passed our friend one could notice a slight turn of the head which, coupled with the expression in her face, seemed to indicate this as her thought,--Your dress and your conduct are not wholly in keeping with a lady of your years. Thank God, then, thank God they are not. And may He in His great goodness and love send us an innumerable company of the same rare type; and may they live a thousand years to bless mankind, to impart the life-giving influences of their own royal lives to the numerous ones all about us who stand so much in need of them. Would you remain always young, and would you carry all the joyousness and buoyancy of youth into your maturer years? Then have care concerning but one thing,--how you live in your thought world. This will determine all. It was the inspired one, Gautama, the Buddha, who said,--'The mind is everything; what you think you become.' And the same thing had Ruskin in mind when he said,--'Make yourself nests of pleasant thoughts. None of us as yet know, for none of us have been taught in early youth, what fairy palaces we may build of beautiful thought,--proof against all adversity.' And would you have in your body all the elasticity, all the strength, all the beauty of your younger years? Then live these in your mind, making no room for unclean thought, and you will externalize them in your body. In the degree that you keep young in thought will you remain young in body. And you will find that your body will in turn aid your mind, for body helps mind the same as mind builds body. You are continually building, and so externalizing in your body conditions most akin to the thoughts and emotions you entertain. And not only are you so building from within, but you are also continually drawing from without, forces of a kindred nature. Your particular kind of thought connects you with a similar order of thought from without. If it is bright, hopeful, cheerful, you connect yourself with a current of thought of this nature. If it is sad, fearing, despondent, then this is the order of thought you connect yourself with. If the latter is the order of your thought, then perhaps unconsciously and by degrees you have been connecting yourself with it. You need to go back and pick up again a part of your child nature, with its careless and cheerful type of thought. 'The minds of the group of children at play are unconsciously concentrated in drawing to their bodies a current of playful thought. Place a child by itself, deprive it of its companions, and soon it will mope and become slow of movement. It is cut off from that peculiar thought current and is literally 'out of its element.' 'You need to bring again this current of playful thought to you which has gradually been turned off. You are too serious or sad, or absorbed in the serious affairs of life. You can be playful and cheerful without being puerile or silly. You can carry on business all the better for being in the playful mood when your mind is off your business. There is nothing but ill resulting from the permanent mood of sadness and seriousness,--the mood which by many so long maintained makes it actually difficult for them to smile at all. 'At eighteen or twenty you commenced growing out of the more playful tendency of early youth. You took hold of the more serious side of life. You went into some business. You became more or less involved in its cares, perplexities and responsibilities. Or, as man or woman, you entered on some phase of life involving care or trouble. Or you became absorbed in some game of business which, as you followed it, left no time for play. Then as you associated with older people you absorbed their old ideas, their mechanical methods of thinking, their acceptance of errors without question or thought of question. In all this you opened your mind to a heavy, care-laden current of thought. Into this you glided unconsciously. That thought is materialized in your blood and flesh. The seen of your body is a deposit or crystallization of the unseen element ever flowing to your body from your mind. Years pass on and you find that your movements are stiff and cumbrous,--that you can with difficulty climb a tree, as at fourteen. Your mind has all this time been sending to your body these heavy, inelastic elements, making your body what now it is.... 'Your change for the better must be gradual, and can only be accomplished by bringing the thought current of an all-round symmetrical strength to bear on it,--by demanding of the Supreme Power to be led in the best way, by diverting your mind from the many unhealthy thoughts which habitually have been flowing into it without your knowing it, to healthier ones.... 'Like the beast, the bodies of those of our race have in the past weakened and decayed. This will not always be. Increase of spiritual knowledge will show the cause of such decay, and will show, also, how to take advantage of a Law or Force to build us up, renew ever the body and give it greater and greater strength, instead of blindly using that Law or Force, as has been done in the past, to weaken our bodies and finally destroy them.' Full, rich, and abounding health is the normal and the natural condition of life. Anything else is an abnormal condition, and abnormal conditions as a rule come through perversions. God never created sickness, suffering, and disease; they are man's own creations. They come through his violating the laws under which he lives. So used are we to seeing them that we come gradually, if not to think of them as natural, then to look upon them as a matter of course. The time will come when the work of the physician will not be to treat and attempt to heal the body, but to heal the mind, which in turn will heal the body.""","""Mindfulness and its impact on aging""","2089","""Mindfulness, the practice of being fully present and engaged in the moment, has shown significant benefits for individuals as they age. As we navigate the journey of growing older, practicing mindfulness can have a profound impact on our physical, mental, and emotional well-being. This ancient practice, rooted in Buddhist tradition, has gained popularity in recent years as a powerful tool for promoting healthy aging and enhancing overall quality of life.  One of the key benefits of mindfulness for aging individuals is its ability to reduce stress and promote emotional well-being. As we age, we may face various stressors such as health concerns, changes in lifestyle, or loss of loved ones. Mindfulness can help older adults manage these stressors by teaching them to focus on the present moment without judgment. By cultivating an awareness of their thoughts and emotions, individuals can learn to respond to challenges with greater resilience and a sense of calm.  Moreover, mindfulness has been shown to improve cognitive function and brain health in older adults. Research suggests that regular mindfulness practice can enhance memory, attention, and decision-making skills. As we age, cognitive decline can be a concern, but mindfulness offers a way to support brain health and preserve cognitive function. By engaging in mindfulness activities such as meditation or mindful breathing, older adults can stimulate their neural pathways and promote mental acuity.  In addition to its cognitive benefits, mindfulness can also have a positive impact on physical health. Older adults who practice mindfulness may experience improvements in conditions such as chronic pain, hypertension, and insomnia. Mindfulness techniques, such as body scans and gentle movement exercises, can help individuals manage physical discomfort and improve their overall sense of well-being. By promoting relaxation and reducing the body's stress response, mindfulness can contribute to better physical health outcomes for aging individuals.  Furthermore, mindfulness can enhance the quality of relationships and social connections among older adults. As individuals age, maintaining meaningful connections with others becomes increasingly important for their well-being. By practicing mindfulness, older adults can cultivate compassion, empathy, and patience in their interactions with loved ones and caregivers. Mindfulness can help individuals listen more attentively, communicate more effectively, and respond to others with kindness and understanding, thereby strengthening their relationships and fostering a sense of connection and belonging.  Another significant aspect of mindfulness in aging is its role in promoting resilience and adaptability. Aging can bring about various life transitions and challenges, such as retirement, changes in health, or loss of independence. Mindfulness enables individuals to navigate these transitions with greater acceptance and flexibility. By staying present and attuned to their emotions and needs, older adults can approach life changes with a sense of equanimity and adaptability, allowing them to embrace new opportunities and experiences with an open mind.  Overall, mindfulness offers older adults a holistic approach to aging gracefully and maintaining a sense of vitality and well-being. By cultivating mindfulness practices, such as meditation, yoga, or mindful walking, individuals can enhance their physical, mental, and emotional resilience as they navigate the process of aging. Mindfulness empowers older adults to savor the present moment, cultivate gratitude for the joys in life, and face challenges with courage and grace. Through mindfulness, aging can be viewed as a journey of growth, wisdom, and self-discovery, fostering a sense of fulfillment and contentment in the later stages of life.""","658"
"Tutton A E H  Alfred Edwin Howard ","""In this beautiful manner has the controversy between the schools of Hauy and Mitscherlich now been settled, the interesting law described in this chapter having definitely laid down the true nature and limitations of isomorphism, while at the same time absolutely proving as a law of nature the constancy and specific character of the crystal angles of every definitely chemically constituted substance. XI THE OF, AND THE AND. Polymorphism. It has been shown in Chapter VII. that Mitscherlich had in several instances proved the possibility of the occurrence of the same substance in two different forms, notably sodium dihydrogen phosphate NaHPO.HO, calcium carbonate best known and most easily prepared, from the state of fusion, of all the forms other than the common rhombic form, in which sulphur is found in the neighbourhood of volcanoes and in which it is also deposited from solution in carbon bisulphide is of distinctly lower stability, the crystals passing in a few days into powder composed of minute crystals of the stable rhombic variety. But in the case of carbon, with its totally different and apparently at ordinary temperatures equally stable varieties of octahedral-cubic hexagonal graphite, there is some doubt; for although the diamond is converted into graphite at a red heat in the electric arc, it is doubtful whether we are not in the presence of a case of chemical polymerism or allotropy, like the case of ozone, where three atoms of oxygen compose the molecule, instead of the two atoms in the molecule of ordinary oxygen. The fact that the negatively electrified electronic corpuscles of the Crookes tube cause the same conversion of diamond into graphite, producing according to Parsons and Swinton a temperature of,90 C. in the act, is evidence in favour of allotropy, as the charged corpuscles are a very likely agent for breaking down such atomic combinations. Moreover, diamond is volatilised out of contact with air at,00 C. without liquefaction, and the vapour when cold condenses as graphite. But there is reason to believe, from experiments by Sir Andrew Noble and Sir William Crookes, that under great pressure carbon does liquefy at,00 C., and that the liquid drops on cooling crystallise as diamond. The yellow and red varieties of phosphorus may also be due to a similar cause, the yellow variety, which forms excellent crystals, corresponding to P, while the red variety may correspond to a molecule composed of a different number of atoms than four. Another view of the nature of polymorphism has lately been brought forward by Lehmann, as the result of his remarkable experimental discovery of liquid crystals, to which fuller reference will be made in Chapter XVI.""","""Isomorphism and polymorphism in crystals""","542","""Isomorphism and polymorphism are fascinating concepts in the realm of crystallography that help explain the structural diversity and behavior of crystals. Isomorphism refers to the phenomenon where different compounds crystallize in the same crystal structure. This means that these compounds share similar arrangements of atoms within the crystal lattice despite being chemically distinct. On the other hand, polymorphism describes the ability of a substance to exist in multiple crystalline forms or crystal structures. This results in different physical properties even though the chemical composition remains the same.  Isomorphism arises from similarities in ionic radii and coordination numbers of ions in different compounds. When these factors closely match, the ions can substitute for one another in the crystal lattice, leading to isomorphic crystals. One classic example of isomorphism is the Olivine group of minerals, where various metal ions like magnesium, iron, manganese, and nickel can substitute for one another in the crystal structure while maintaining the same overall crystal form.  Polymorphism, on the other hand, is driven by differences in the packing arrangements of atoms or molecules within a crystal lattice. These variations can arise due to differences in temperature, pressure, or other external factors during crystal formation. For instance, carbon exhibits polymorphism with diamond and graphite being two well-known crystal structures of carbon with vastly different properties.  Understanding isomorphism and polymorphism is crucial in various fields such as material science, geology, pharmaceuticals, and chemistry. In materials science, polymorphism can significantly impact the properties of a material, making it essential for designing new materials with desirable characteristics. For example, the ability of a substance to exist in multiple forms can lead to variations in hardness, solubility, or color, which can be exploited for different applications.  Polymorphism also plays a vital role in the pharmaceutical industry, where different crystal forms of a drug can have distinct solubilities and stabilities, affecting bioavailability and efficacy. The study of crystal polymorphism is crucial in drug development to ensure the desired form is stable and effective.  In chemistry, isomorphism and polymorphism provide insights into the behavior of substances at the molecular level. Researchers use X-ray crystallography and other analytical techniques to study crystal structures and understand how isomorphism and polymorphism influence the properties of materials.  In conclusion, isomorphism and polymorphism are intriguing concepts that elucidate the structural diversity and behavior of crystals. These phenomena are not only of scientific interest but also have practical applications in various industries. By delving deeper into the complexities of crystal structures, researchers can uncover new insights that pave the way for innovative discoveries and developments in a wide range of fields.""","532"
"Clarkson Thomas","""By the assistance of Mr. Falconbridge, I found a public-house, which had two rooms in it: nearly at the top of the partition between them was a small window, which a person might look through by standing upon a chair. I desired Ormond, one evening, to invite the man into the larger room, in which he was to have a candle, and, to talk with him on the subject. I proposed to station myself in the smallest in the dark, so that by looking through the window I could both see and hear him, and yet be unperceived myself. The room, in which I was to be, was one where the dead were frequently carried to be owned. We were all in our places at the time appointed. I directly discovered that it was the same man with whom I had conversed on board the ship in the wet docks. I heard him distinctly relate many of the particulars of the murder, and acknowledge them all. Ormond, after having talked with him some time, said, 'Well, then, you believe Peter Green was actually murdered?' He replied, 'If Peter Green was not murdered, no man ever was.' What followed I do not know. I had heard quite enough; and the room was so disagreeable in smell, that I did not choose to stay in it longer than was absolutely necessary. I own I was now quite satisfied that the murder had taken place, and my first thought was to bring the matter before the mayor, and to take up three of the officers of the ship. But, in mentioning my intention to my friends, I was dissuaded from it. They had no doubt but that in Liverpool, as there was now a notion that the Slave Trade would become a subject of parliamentary inquiry, every, effort would be made to overthrow me. They were of opinion also that such of the magistrates, as were interested in the trade, when applied to for warrants of apprehension, would contrive to give notice to the officers to escape. In addition to this they believed, that so many in the town were already incensed against me, that I should be torn to pieces, and the house where I lodged burnt down, if I were to make the attempt. I thought it right therefore to do nothing for the present; but I sent Ormond to London, to keep him out of the way of corruption, till I should make up my mind as to further proceedings on the subject. It is impossible, if I observe the bounds I have prescribed myself, and I believe the reader will be glad of it on account of his own feelings, that I should lay open the numerous cases, which came before me at Liverpool, relative to the ill-treatment of the seamen in this wicked trade. It may be sufficient to say, that they harassed my constitution, and affected my spirits daily. They were in my thoughts on my pillow after I retired to rest, and I found them before my eyes when I awoke. Afflicting, however, as they were, they were of great use in the promotion of our cause: for they served, whatever else failed, as a stimulus to perpetual energy: they made me think light of former labours, and they urged me imperiously to new. And here I may observe, that among the many circumstances which ought to excite our joy on considering the great event of the abolition of the Slave Trade, which has now happily taken place, there are few for which we ought to be more grateful, than that from this time our commerce ceases to breed such abandoned wretches: while those, who have thus been bred in it, and who may yet find employment in other trades, will, in the common course of nature, be taken off in a given time, so that our marine will at length be purified from a race of monsters, which have helped to cripple its strength, and to disgrace its character. The temper of many of the interested people of Liverpool had now become still more irritable, and their hostility more apparent than before. I received anonymous letters, entreating me to leave it, or I should otherwise never leave it alive. The only effect which this advice had upon me, was to make me more vigilant when I went out at night. I never stirred out at this time without Mr. Falconbridge; and he never accompanied me without being well armed. Of this, however, I knew nothing until we had left the place. There was certainly a time when I had reason to believe that I had a narrow escape. I was one day on the pier-head with many others looking at some little boats below at the time of a heavy gale. Several persons, probably out of curiosity, were hastening thither. I had seen all I intended to see, and was departing, when I noticed eight or nine persons making towards me. I was then only about eight or nine yards from the precipice of the pier, but going from it. I expected that they would have divided to let me through them; instead of which they closed upon me and bore me back. I was borne within a yard of the precipice, when I discovered my danger; and perceiving among them the murderer of Peter Green, and two others who had insulted me at the King's Arms, it instantly struck me that they had a design to throw me over the pier-head; which they might have done at this time, and yet have pleaded that I had been killed by accident. There was not a moment to lose. Vigorous on account of the danger, I darted forward. One of them, against whom I pushed myself, fell down: their ranks were broken; and I escaped, not without blows, amidst their imprecations and abuse. I determined now to go to Lancaster, to make some inquiries about the Slave Trade there. I had a letter of introduction to William Jepson, one of the religious society of the Quakers, for this purpose. I found from him, that, though there were slave-merchants at Lancaster, they made their outfits at Liverpool, as a more convenient port. I learnt too from others, that the captain of the last vessel, which had sailed out of Lancaster to the coast of Africa for slaves, had taken off so many of the natives treacherously, that any other vessel known to come from it would be cut off. There were only now one or two superannuated captains living in the place. Finding I could get no oral testimony, I was introduced into the Custom-house. Here I just looked over the muster-rolls of such slave-vessels as had formerly sailed from this port; and having found that the loss of seamen was precisely in the same proportion as elsewhere, I gave myself no further trouble, but left the place. On my return to Liverpool, I was informed by Mr. Falconbridge, that a ship-mate of Ormond, of the name of Patrick Murray, who had been discharged in the West Indies, had arrived there. This man, he said, had been to call upon me in my absence, to seek redress for his own bad usage; but in the course of conversation he had confirmed all the particulars as stated by Ormond, relative to the murder of Peter Green. On consulting the muster-roll of the ship, I found his name, and that he had been discharged in the West Indies on the nd of February. I determined, therefore, to see him. I cross-examined him in the best manner I could. I could neither make him contradict himself, nor say anything that militated against the testimony of Ormond. I was convinced, therefore, of the truth of the transaction; and, having obtained his consent, I sent him to London to stay with the latter, till he should hear further from me. I learnt also from Mr. Falconbridge, that visitors had continued to come to the King's Arms during my absence; that they had been very liberal of their abuse of me; and that one of them did not hesitate to 'I deserved to be thrown over the pierhead.' Finding now that I could get no further evidence; that the information which I had already obtained was considerable; and that the committee had expressed an earnest desire, in a letter which I had received, that I would take into consideration the propriety of writing my Essay on the Impolicy of the Slave Trade as soon as possible, I determined upon leaving Liverpool. I went round accordingly and took leave of my friends. The last of these was William Rathbone, and I have to regret, that it was also the last time I ever saw him. Independently of the gratitude I owed him for assisting me in this great cause, I respected him highly as a man: he possessed a fine understanding with a solid judgment: he was a person of extraordinary simplicity of manners. Though he lived in a state of pecuniary independence, he gave an example of great temperance, as well as of great humility of mind: but however humble he appeared, he had always the courage to dare to do that which was right, however it might resist the customs or the prejudices of men. In his own line of trade, which was that of a timber-merchant on an extensive scale, he would not allow any article to be sold for the use of a slave-ship, and he always refused those, who applied to him for materials for such purposes. But it is evident that it was his intention, if he had lived, to bear his testimony still more publicly upon this subject; for an advertisement, stating the ground of his refusal to furnish anything for this traffic upon Christian principles, with a memorandum for two advertisements in the Liverpool papers, was found among his papers at his decease. XIX Author proceeds to Manchester; finds a spirit rising among the people there for the abolition of the Slave Trade; is requested to deliver a discourse on the subject of the Slave Trade; heads of it, and extracts.--Proceeds to Keddleston, and Birmingham; finds a similar spirit at the latter place.--Revisits Bristol; new and difficult situation there.--Author crosses the Severn at night; unsuccessful termination of his journey; returns to London. I now took my departure from Liverpool, and proceeded to Manchester, where I arrived on the Friday evening.""","""Abolition of the Slave Trade""","2093","""The abolition of the slave trade stands as one of the most significant and morally charged events in human history. Dating back to the early 16th century, the transatlantic slave trade saw millions of Africans forcibly taken from their homes, sold into bondage, and subjected to unspeakable cruelty for the economic gain of European powers and American colonists. The abolitionist movement that eventually led to the end of this horrific practice was a testament to the power of human resilience, empathy, and the fight for justice.  The transatlantic slave trade was a brutal chapter in history marked by the commodification of human beings. European colonizers viewed Africans as mere property, to be bought, sold, and exploited for labor in plantations, mines, and households. The trade not only tore families apart but also inflicted immense physical and psychological trauma on those who endured its horrors. The inhumane conditions on slave ships during the Middle Passage, where Africans were crammed into overcrowded and unsanitary conditions for the long journey across the Atlantic, underscored the dehumanization at the heart of the trade.  As the slave trade grew in scale and profitability, so too did the resistance against it. Enslaved individuals, free blacks, sympathetic whites, and religious groups began to speak out against the inhumanity of the trade and the institution of slavery as a whole. Figures like Olaudah Equiano, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and Sojourner Truth courageously shared their stories of enslavement and advocated for the abolition of slavery, inspiring others to join the cause.  The abolitionist movement gained momentum in the late 18th century, fueled by moral outrage, religious convictions, and a growing awareness of the inherent injustice of slavery. In Britain, the tireless campaigning of individuals like William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, and Granville Sharp led to the eventual passing of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in 1807, which prohibited the trading of slaves throughout the British Empire. This landmark legislation marked a significant victory in the fight against the transatlantic slave trade and paved the way for further abolitionist efforts.  The abolition of the slave trade did not come easy, nor did it signal the end of slavery itself. While the trade was officially outlawed, slavery persisted in various forms in the Americas and continued to be a lucrative enterprise for slave owners and traders. The fight for the full emancipation of enslaved individuals required continued agitation, resistance, and legislative action to dismantle the institution of slavery entirely.  In the United States, the abolitionist movement gained ground in the 19th century, with organizations like the American Anti-Slavery Society and prominent leaders such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Beecher Stowe galvanizing public opinion against the """"peculiar institution"""" of slavery. The issue of slavery became increasingly divisive, culminating in the American Civil War, which ultimately led to the abolition of slavery with the passage of the 13th Amendment in 1865.  The legacy of the abolition of the slave trade reverberates to this day, serving as a poignant reminder of the atrocities committed in the name of greed, power, and racism. It stands as a testament to the resilience of those who fought against oppression and exploitation, and as a beacon of hope for the ongoing struggle for equality and justice. The abolitionist movement offers timeless lessons in courage, solidarity, and the power of collective action in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.  Despite the official end of the transatlantic slave trade, the legacies of slavery continue to shape societies around the world. The deep-rooted inequalities, systemic racism, and social injustices that originated from centuries of exploitation and dehumanization are still deeply entrenched in many societies. The effects of slavery are far-reaching and continue to manifest in economic disparities, educational inequities, and social prejudices that disproportionately impact marginalized communities.  Acknowledging the abolition of the slave trade is not merely an exercise in historical reflection but a call to action to address the enduring legacies of slavery and to strive for a more just and equitable world. The abolitionist movement serves as a powerful example of the impact that committed individuals can have in challenging oppressive systems and effecting meaningful change. By studying the history of abolition, we can gain valuable insights into the resilience of the human spirit, the consequences of unchecked power, and the imperative of standing up for justice in the face of injustice.  In conclusion, the abolition of the slave trade was a watershed moment in human history that marked the beginning of the end of one of the most egregious crimes against humanity. The tireless efforts of abolitionists, activists, and freedom fighters in challenging the dehumanizing institution of slavery paved the way for a more just and equitable future. While the scars of slavery remain visible in society today, the legacy of the abolitionist movement reminds us of the enduring power of resistance, solidarity, and hope in the face of adversity.""","998"
"Galbreath C B  Charles Burleigh ","""The toy was made of light material to resemble a bird. When the father released it in the presence of the wondering boys, to their astonishment it flew upward in the room, rose to the ceiling and after fluttering there for a little while fell to the floor. They did not concern themselves much about the name of the toy, but properly called it what to their minds it most closely resembled-- the bat. They afterward made other toys like it and discovered that as they were increased in size they flew less successfully. They early developed a fondness for kite flying and in this were regarded as experts. When they grew to manhood, however, they abandoned these boyish sports and devoted themselves industriously to their machine and repair shop. The bat and the kite became memories, but the memories of youth have power to shape the thoughts of manhood, and this early observation and experience with aerial toys gave to Wilbur and Orville Wright an interest in the attempts at aviation that were chronicled in the press from time to time through the decade immediately preceding this new century. In the year 896 Orville, the younger of the two brothers, was convalescing from a serious attack of typhoid fever. Wilbur, who had been carefully attending him, was one day reading aloud an account of the death of Otto Lilienthal, the German aviator, who was killed while experimenting with his glider. The details of the tragic accident, together with an account of what he had accomplished by years of investigation and experiment, interested the brothers, who resolved as soon as possible to apply themselves to the construction of a glider in which flights could be made with comparative safety. The enthusiasm of Orville over the project ran so high that it almost caused a return of the fever. As soon as he had fully recovered, the two brothers returned to their bicycle shop and applied themselves with increasing zeal to the study of aeronautics, and after a time began the construction of a glider. The Wright brothers were peculiarly well equipped for the work upon which they had entered. They were men of unflagging industry, abstemious habits, few words and the happy faculty of keeping their own counsel. Wilbur was unusually reticent. It is said of him that he spoke only when he had something to say and then in a manner singularly brief and direct. He had an unlimited capacity for hard work, nerves of steel and the kind of daring that makes the aviator face death with pleasure every minute of the time he is in the air. Orville, while much like his brother, is more talkative and approachable. Both were modest and unassuming when they began their work and continued so when the world applauded their achievements. In the study of the problem upon the solution of which they ventured, they had of course the advantage of all that had thus far been achieved by those who had preceded them in this field of investigation and experiment. Professor Langley had already perfected his first monoplane to such an extent that short flights were successfully made with a light steam-propelled model. He was continuing his experiments and the Wright brothers read with avidity the results of his work. Every scrap of information that they could gather from others who had essayed the solution of the problem was now collected and made the subject of critical study. At first taking up aeronautics merely as a sport, they soon afterward with zest began its more serious pursuit. We reluctantly entered upon the scientific side of it. they said, but we soon found the work so fascinating that we were drawn into it deeper and deeper. In their efforts to construct a practical flying machine they adopted the plan of Lilienthal and Chanute. They sought to construct a machine which they could control and in which they could make glides with safety. This they built in the form of a biplane glider and with it they experimented industriously for years. The successful construction of the machine required a high degree of skill. The length and width of the planes, their distance apart, the materials to be used, the shape, size and position of the rudder and numerous other details were to be worked out only by patient study and frequent tests. They were now in the field of original experiment and soon found that they had to reject as useless many theories that had been carefully elaborated by scholarly writers. The brothers soon learned that a long narrow plane in a position nearly horizontal, moved in a direction at right angles to one of its lateral edges and inclined or tipped slightly upward would develop greater lifting power than a square or circular plane. This discovery was not indeed original with them, but their experiments confirmed the conclusions of their predecessors. The surface shape of the plane is an important consideration. It has been found that a slight upward arch from beneath, making the under surface concave, gives the best results. The concavity should reach its maximum about one-third of the distance from the front or entering edge to the rear edge of the plane and should be the same whether one or more planes are used. In flight the forward or entering edges of the planes are tipped slightly upward to give the machine lifting power for the same reason that the top of a kite is given an angle of elevation so that the air will lift it as it is drawn forward by the string. Balancing the Machine The balancing of a machine in mid-air is one of the most difficult problems in aviation. In the balloon this is easily accomplished because the principal weight, the basket with the passenger, is below the gas-filled sphere or compartment, and the balloon tends to right itself after any disturbance by the wind, much like a plummet when swayed out of its position. Professor Langley, Lilienthal and others had sought to take advantage of this tendency in the construction of their machines by placing or arching the wings above the pilot or heavier portion of the mechanism. After a slight disturbance in mid-air the machine would then tend to right or balance itself and assume its former position. The practical difficulty of this arrangement, however, arose from the fact that when once set to swaying the gliders thus constructed continued to sway like the pendulum of a clock. The Wright brothers set themselves the task of finding some other method of preventing the biplane from dipping downward or upward at either side with the shifting of air currents. The first device to give steadiness of motion was a small movable horizontal plane, supported parallel with and in front of the two main planes, and by means of a lever, under control of the pilot. At Kitty Hawk Having after much study completed their glider, the Wright brothers sought a suitable place for their first tests. By correspondence with the United States Weather Bureau they learned that at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the winds are stronger and more constant than at any other point in the United States. This treeless waste of sand dunes along the solitary shore near the village afforded the privacy where they might carry on their work unmolested. Here in October, 900, they spent their vacation testing their biplane glider. They sought to fly it in the face of the wind like a kite. This they succeeded in doing but it would not support the weight of a man. They then experimented with it, using light ropes from below to work the levers and guide it through the air. It was sufficiently responsive to encourage them and they went back home to make at their leisure a number of improvements. The year following they returned to the same place with a larger machine considerably improved, but it still failed to lift the operator. Octave Chanute, of Chicago, with whom they had been in correspondence, came to witness their tests and examine their glider. They now decided to abandon much of the scientific data which they had collected from the writings of others and proceeded in the light of their own experience. They coasted down the air from the tops of sand dunes and tested with satisfaction their devices for guiding their air craft. In 902, with additional improvements, they made almost one thousand gliding flights, some of which carried them a little over six hundred feet, more than twice the distance attained the previous year. All this time their object had been to control the machine while in air. Only after this was accomplished did they propose to add motive power to keep it above the earth. They wisely reasoned that it would be useless to apply this power to a machine that could not be directed and controlled. The First Flight The Wrights had now reached a point where they felt that they were ready to apply motive power, rise like a bird from the earth and direct their course through the air. A new machine was built with two planes, each six feet six inches wide and measuring forty feet from tip to tip. The planes were arranged one directly above the other with an intervening space of six feet. An elevating rudder of two horizontal planes ten feet in front of the machine, and a rudder of two vertical planes about six feet long and one foot apart in the rear of the machine were under control by levers close to the hands of the pilot, who, prostrate on the lower large plane, directed the course up or down, to the right or left at will. But the most remarkable features of all were the gasoline engine that was to give motive power and the propellers by which that power was to move the machine in its flight through the air. The mechanism, the result of patient study and arduous labor, had been perfected in the little shop at Dayton and had been brought to the barren sand coast of North Carolina for its first practical test.""","""Wright brothers and aviation development""","1939","""Orville and Wilbur Wright, known as the Wright brothers, are credited with inventing the world's first successful airplane. Born in the mid-19th century in Ohio, the brothers had a deep passion for aviation and a keen interest in the mechanics of flight. Their groundbreaking achievements revolutionized transportation and paved the way for modern air travel.  The Wright brothers' journey to aviation history began with their fascination with kites and gliders. They conducted extensive research and experiments to understand the principles of flight, studying the works of renowned aeronautical pioneers like Sir George Cayley and Otto Lilienthal. By observing birds in flight, they gained valuable insights into how to achieve controlled, powered flight.  In 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the Wright brothers achieved their milestone accomplishment by successfully piloting the Wright Flyer, a biplane they designed and built themselves. On December 17th, Orville took to the skies for the first powered, controlled, and sustained flight in history, covering a distance of 120 feet in 12 seconds. This historic event marked the dawn of a new era in aviation.  Following their initial success, the Wright brothers continued to refine their aircraft design and improve its performance.

"Rauschenbusch Walter","""He was trying to bring their feet to the ground, turn their mind to realities, and make their religion socially efficient. Would the sight of a miracle have effected a moral change in a Pharisee? How would religion be affected, if miraculous demonstrations could be furnished at will? Sixth Day: When Religion Separates Men And as Jesus passed by from thence, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and sinners? But when he heard it, he said, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. But go ye and learn what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice: for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.--Matt.:-3. The Jewish community, religious at the core, had a fringe of people who had failed to live up to the requirements of the Law. They came under the condemnation of the respectable people and of their own conscience, and drifted into the despised and vicious occupations. These were the 'publicans and sinners,' the 'publicans and harlots,' to whom the Gospels refer. A socially efficient religion would have prompted the good people to establish loving and saving contact with these people. Actually religion so accentuated the social divergence that the Pharisees were shocked when Jesus mingled in a friendly way with this class and even added one of them to his traveling companions. The parables of the lost coin, lost sheep, and prodigal son were spoken in reply to the slur, 'This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them' (Luke 5/8). The elder brother of the prodigal pictures this loveless and censorious religion. Jesus crossed the line of demarcation and established social contact and friendliness, through which salvation could come to these religious derelicts. He quoted again the old saying of the prophets, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' God was not as much concerned about correct religious performances as the Pharisees thought, and a great deal more concerned about mercy for the fallen, and the simple human qualities which bring the strong and the weak together. What experiences have we had of refusal to associate? Was the cleavage along lines of race, wealth, education, morals, or religion? Has religion with us been an impulse toward men, or away from men? Seventh Day: Be Useful or Die And he spake this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none. And he said unto the vinedresser, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it also cumber the ground? And he answering saith unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: and if it bear fruit thenceforth, well; but if not, thou shalt cut it down.--Luke 3:-. Jesus evidently had some interest in scientific agriculture. Both the owner and the vine-dresser in this parable were out for agricultural efficiency. The owner hated to see soil and space wasted; the vine-dresser was reluctant to sacrifice a tree, and proposed better tillage and more fertilizer. Taking this parable in connection with what precedes, we see that Jesus was concerned about the future of his nation and its religion. Both would have to validate their right to exist; God could not have them cumber the ground. They must make good. This is the stern urge of the God whom we know in history and evolution, with the voice of Christ pleading for patience. But it is agreed between them that ultimately the law of fitness must rule. Religion can not bank on claims of antiquity alone. Every generation must find it newly efficient to create the social virtues then needed. Remember that this was spoken by a Jewish patriot and the supreme exponent of the Hebrew religion. Give historical instances of the permanent downfall or decline of nations. Trace the connection between their fate and their religion. Study for the Week Jesus Christ was the founder of the highest religion; he was himself the purest religious spirit known to us. Why, then, was he in opposition to religion? The clash between him and the representatives of organized religion was not occasional or superficial. It ran through his whole activity, was one of the dominant notes in his teaching, culminated in the great spiritual duel between him and the Jewish hierarchy in the last days at Jerusalem, and led directly to his crucifixion. I The opposition of Jesus was not, of course, against religion itself, but against religion as he found it. It was not directed against any departure from the legitimate order of the priesthood; nor against an improper ritual or wrong doctrine of sacrifices. In fact, it did not turn on any of the issues which were of such importance to the Church in later times. He criticized the most earnest religious men of his day because their religion harmed men instead of helping them. It was unsocial, or anti-social. The Old Testament prophets also were in opposition to the priestly system of their time because it used up the religious interest of the people in ceremonial performances without ethical outcome. It diverted spiritual energy, by substituting lower religious requirements for the one fundamental thing which God required--righteousness in social and political life. They insisted over and over that Jehovah wants righteousness and wants nothing else. Their aim was to make religion and ethics one and inseparable. They struck for the social efficiency of religion. At the time of Jesus the Jewish sacrifices had lost much of their religious importance. During the Exile they had lapsed. They were professional performances of one class. The numerous Jews scattered in other countries perhaps saw the temple once in a lifetime. Modern feeling in the first century was against bloody sacrifices. The recorded sayings of Jesus hardly mention them. On the other hand the daily life of the people was pervaded by little prescribed religious actions. The Sabbath with its ritual was punctiliously observed. There were frequent days of fasting, religious ablutions and baths, long prayers to be recited several times daily, with prayer straps around the arm and forehead, and a tasseled cloth over the head. The exact performance of these things seemed an essential part of religion to the most earnest men. We have seen how Jesus collided with these religious requirements and on what grounds. If men were deeply concerned about the taboo food that went into their bodies, they would not be concerned about the evil thoughts that arose in their souls. If they were taught to focus on petty duties, such as tithing, the great ethical principles and obligations moved to the outer field of vision and became blurred. The Sabbath, which had originated in merciful purpose toward the poor, had been turned into another burden. Religion, which ought to bring good men into saving contact with the wayward by love, actually resulted in separating the two by a chasm of religious pride and censoriousness. A man-made and artificial religious performance, such as giving toward the support of the temple, crowded aside fundamental obligations written deep in the constitution of human society, such as filial reverence and family solidarity. Other reformers have condemned religious practices because they were departures from the holy Book or from primitive custom. Jesus, too, pointed out that some of these regulations were recent innovations. But the real standard by which he judged current religious questions was not ancient authority but the present good of men. The spiritual center on which he took his stand and from which he judged all things, was the Kingdom of God, the perfect social order. Even the ordinances of religion must justify themselves by making an effective contribution to the Kingdom of God. The Sabbath was made for man, and its observance must meet the test of service to man's welfare. It must function wholesomely. The candle must give light, or what is the use of it? The salt must be salty and preserve from decay, or it will be thrown out and trodden under foot. If the fig-tree bears no fruit, why is it allowed to use up space and crowd better plants off the soil? This, then, is Christ's test in matters of institutional religion. The Church and all its doings must serve the Kingdom of God. II The social efficiency of religion is a permanent social problem. What is the annual expense of maintaining the churches in the United States? How much capital is invested in the church buildings? (See U. S. Census Bulletin No. 03, of 906.) How much care and interest and loving free-will labor does an average village community bestow on religion as compared with other objects? All men feel instinctively that religion exerts a profound and subtle influence on the springs of conduct. Even those who denounce it, acknowledge at least its power for harm. Most of us know it as a power for good. But all history shows that this great spiritual force easily deteriorates. Corruptio optimi pessima. Religion may develop an elaborate social apparatus of its own, wheels within wheels, and instead of being a dynamic of righteousness in the natural social relations of men, its energies may be consumed in driving its own machinery. Instead of being the power-house supplying the Kingdom of God among men with power and light, the Church may exist for its own sake. It then may become an expensive consumer of social wealth, a conservative clog, and a real hindrance of social progress. Live religion gives proof of its value by the sense of freedom, peace, and elation which it creates.""","""Social efficiency of religion""","2032","""Religion has played a significant role in shaping societies throughout history, influencing individuals, communities, and entire civilizations in various ways. One notable aspect of religion is its potential to contribute to social efficiency, impacting how people interact, organize, and function within a society. From promoting values of compassion and altruism to providing a sense of community and belonging, religion can serve as a valuable mechanism for enhancing social cohesion and efficiency.  At the heart of many religious teachings are moral principles that advocate for compassion, kindness, and ethical behavior. These values often form the basis of community norms and expectations, guiding individuals towards actions that benefit not only themselves but also their fellow human beings. By instilling a sense of accountability and responsibility based on religious beliefs, societies can promote prosocial behaviors that contribute to a harmonious social fabric. For example, religions such as Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism emphasize concepts like charity, empathy, and justice, encouraging adherents to prioritize the well-being of others and engage in acts of service and charity.  Moreover, religion can act as a unifying force within a community, fostering a sense of belonging and solidarity among its members. Religious institutions often serve as gathering places where individuals come together to worship, celebrate, mourn, and support one another. These communal activities help forge strong social bonds, creating networks of emotional and practical support that enhance individual well-being and collective resilience. In times of crisis or hardship, religious communities often mobilize resources and provide assistance to those in need, demonstrating the power of solidarity and cooperation in promoting social welfare.  Another way in which religion contributes to social efficiency is through the provision of a moral compass and ethical framework that guides decision-making at both the individual and societal levels. Religious teachings offer ethical guidelines that help people navigate complex moral dilemmas and make choices that align with their values and beliefs. By promoting principles of honesty, integrity, justice, and compassion, religion can foster a culture of trust, fairness, and cooperation within a society, reducing conflicts and enhancing social harmony.  Additionally, religion can provide a sense of purpose, meaning, and transcendence that transcends individual concerns and connects people to something larger than themselves. Belief in a higher power or spiritual realm can offer solace in times of suffering, hope in the face of adversity, and a sense of continuity and significance in the midst of life's uncertainties. This sense of transcendent purpose can motivate individuals to engage in acts of selflessness, empathy, and altruism, contributing to the greater good of society and promoting a sense of interconnectedness and interdependence among all beings.  Despite its potential benefits, religion also has the capacity to divide societies and foster intolerance, conflict, and exclusion. History is replete with examples of religious wars, persecution, and discrimination fueled by differences in belief systems and practices. When taken to extremes, religious zealotry and fundamentalism can undermine social cohesion, perpetuate injustice, and impede progress towards a more inclusive and equitable society.  To harness the social efficiency of religion effectively, it is essential to promote interfaith dialogue, tolerance, and respect for diverse belief systems. By fostering understanding and cooperation among different religious communities, societies can leverage the shared values and principles that underpin various faith traditions to address common challenges and advance the common good. Interfaith initiatives that focus on promoting peace, social justice, and sustainable development can serve as platforms for collaboration and solidarity across religious divides, creating opportunities for mutual learning and empowerment.  In conclusion, the social efficiency of religion lies in its potential to promote values of compassion, community, morality, and transcendence that enhance social cohesion, well-being, and harmony. By harnessing the positive aspects of religious teachings and practices while addressing the challenges of extremism and intolerance, societies can leverage the transformative power of religion to build more inclusive, resilient, and compassionate communities. Through dialogue, cooperation, and mutual respect, people of different faiths can work together to create a more just, peaceful, and sustainable world for present and future generations.""","799"
"Syme William Anderson 1879 ","""ACID. An alcoholic solution of the resin was just neutralized with potassium hydroxide. During the titration, the solution rapidly became dark brown. After neutralization it was shaken with ether; the water solution remained brown while the ether layer was nearly colorless and contained practically no dissolved substance. A portion of the water solution of the potassium salt on being acidified with sulphuric acid and standing over night, deposited a slight precipitate. The solution of the potassium salt gave a heavy precipitate with lead acetate somewhat similar to the original lead precipitate A, and also slight precipitates with salts of zinc, mercury, copper, and with an excess of potassium hydroxide gave a black acid was not precipitated by gelatin. On addition of potassium cyanide a transitory red color appeared which reappeared on shaking with air. Gallic acid is distinguished from tannic acid by . At later stages in the work the potassium, barium, and sodium salts of gallic acid were obtained, and finally the pure acid was made by decomposing the sodium salt with sulphuric acid and crystallizing from water. A portion of the acid so obtained was further purified by dissolving in absolute alcohol and pouring into absolute ether. The melting point behavior of the acid corresponds with that of gallic acid; it melted with decomposition at about 30. For further identification, some of the acid was converted into an ester by the following process: it was dissolved in 0 per cent. alcohol, hydrochloric acid gas was passed in, and the solution was heated an hour on the water bath. It was then evaporated to a small bulk, neutralized with barium carbonate and extracted with ether. The ether, on evaporation, left the ester which was crystallized from water and dried in a desiccator over sulphuric acid. The anhydrous ester agreed in melting other properties with the ester of gallic acid described by Grimaux. For the sake of comparison, an ester was made from gallic acid obtained from another source and the two agreed in properties. A mixture of the two esters melted within the limits given for the ester of gallic acid. While the tests leading to the identification of gallic acid were being made, another series of experiments was in progress. Eleven and one-half grams of the resin obtained from lead precipitate A by decomposition with hydrogen sulphide were treated with. n. potassium hydroxide added from a burette until the acid was exactly neutralized. All went into solution. On shaking with ether, some of the potassium salt separated out and was saved for examination. The solution became brown on exposure to air and got darker as the work proceeded. The acid in solution as a potassium salt was precipitated out in four fractions by adding for each fraction one-fourth the amount of. n. sulphuric acid required to neutralize the potassium hydroxide used. The precipitates were filtered off and examined. The first was small in amount, gummy and hard to filter. The solution was shaken with ether after each precipitate had been filtered off. The succeeding precipitates were in better condition, but were not pure. All appeared to be impure gallic acid which had become brown by absorption of oxygen. They were saved, however, to be tested for poison. After the last fraction had separated, the filtrate was shaken several times with ether and saved for further examination, which will be described under 'Rhamnose.' This filtrate is designated as B. At this stage of the work a portion of the resin obtained from lead precipitate A was tested and found to be not poisonous as already mentioned. By this test, all the substances contained in the lead precipitate A after its extraction with ether in the Soxhlet apparatus, were eliminated from the possible poisonous substances. The poison must therefore have been extracted by the ether. A fresh portion of the original poisonous material was treated with 0 per cent. alcohol and filtered from insoluble tar. The filtrate was precipitated in six fractions by lead acetate. The last fractions were lighter in color and apparently much purer than the first. The sixth lead precipitate was decomposed by hydrogen sulphide, the light-yellow water solution was tested and found to be not poisonous. It gave the characteristic reactions for gallic acid. The poison, if precipitated at all by lead acetate, must have gone down in one of the preceding fractions. Later experiments showed that it is brought down partly mechanically and partly as a lead compound in the first precipitates.. Having identified gallic acid, and not finding any other phenol derivative in the lead precipitate, some of the original material was extracted with hot water to remove gallic acid and filtered from tar while hot. The filtrate had a deep yellow color. On cooling over night, an olive green precipitate separated out which was dried and found to be a light powder. It was practically insoluble in cold water, soluble with great difficulty in boiling water from which it separated in yellow flakes, slightly soluble in ether and in acetic acid, but readily soluble in alcohol. The solutions were not acid to litmus, gave a dark color with ferric chloride, an orange-red precipitate with lead acetate which was easily soluble in acetic acid, and an orange-yellow precipitate with stannous chloride. These properties and reactions indicated that the substance was the dye-stuff fisetin and that it occurs in the free state in this plant though it is usually found as a glucoside of fisetin combined with tannic acid. A compound of this kind was found in Rhus cotinus and named 'fustin-tannide' by Schmid. He showed that the fustin-tannide could be decomposed by acetic acid into tannic acid and a glucoside, fustin CHO. Fustin, on heating with dilute sulphuric acid, gave fisetin and a sugar supposed to be rhamnose. Fisetin was also found as a glucoside compound in Rhus rhodanthema by Perkin. The yellow substance which separated from the boiling water solution was further purified by dissolving in a small quantity of hot alcohol and adding hot water. On cooling, the yellow substance separated out in a flocculent condition. Examined under the microscope, the flakes appeared to be made up of masses of fine crystals. An alcoholic solution of the substance gave a black color with ammonia which became red on addition of more ammonia. Concentrated acids intensified the yellow color of the alcoholic solution. Fehling solution and ammoniacal silver nitrate were reduced by it. Potassium hydroxide added to an alcoholic solution gave at first a deep red color accompanied by a green fluorescence which disappeared, leaving a yellow liquid. With an excess of caustic potash, the red color returned and was permanent. These reactions are characteristic for fisetin. Furthermore, fisetin should give protocatechuic acid and phloroglucinol by fusion with caustic potash under proper conditions. The experiment was carried out as follows: grams of fisetin were gently heated in a nickel crucible with grams of caustic potash dissolved in cc. water. An inflammable gas, apparently hydrogen, was evolved during the fusion. The pasty mass was dissolved in water, acidified with sulphuric acid, and filtered. The filtrate was shaken out with ether containing one-fourth its volume of alcohol. The ether was evaporated and the residue was extracted with warm water and filtered. Lead acetate was added to the filtrate to precipitate protocatechuic acid, while phloroglucinol remained in the filtrate from this precipitate. The lead precipitate was suspended in water, decomposed by hydrogen sulphide, filtered, and evaporated to obtain protocatechuic acid. That the substance obtained was protocatechuic acid was shown by the following characteristic tests: It gave a greenish brown color with ferric chloride; on addition of one drop of a dilute solution of sodium carbonate, the color became dark blue; on adding more sodium carbonate the color became red. A violet color was obtained when a solution of the acid was treated with a drop of sodium carbonate solution and then with a drop of ferrous sulphate. It reduced ammoniacal silver nitrate. It did not reduce Fehling solution. The filtrate supposed to contain phloroglucinol was treated with hydrogen sulphide to remove lead, filtered, and shaken with ether. The residue left on evaporating the ether was taken up in water. This solution gave the following reactions characteristic for phloroglucinol: It reduced both silver nitrate and Fehling solution. It colored pine wood moistened with hydrochloric acid red.""","""Chemical Identification and Analysis Techniques""","1807","""Chemical identification and analysis techniques play a crucial role in various fields, including chemistry, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental science, and materials science. These techniques are essential for determining the composition of substances, identifying impurities, studying molecular structures, and ensuring product quality and safety. In this comprehensive overview, we will delve into some of the key methods and technologies used for chemical identification and analysis.  One of the fundamental techniques in chemical analysis is spectroscopy. Spectroscopy involves the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter, leading to the absorption, emission, or scattering of light. Different types of spectroscopy, such as infrared (IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectrometry, provide unique insights into the chemical composition and structure of substances. For instance, IR spectroscopy is valuable for identifying functional groups in organic compounds, while UV-Vis spectroscopy is widely used for quantitative analysis of substances based on their absorbance of light at specific wavelengths.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for determining the molecular structure and dynamics of organic compounds. By measuring the nuclear spin interactions in a magnetic field, NMR spectroscopy can elucidate the connectivity of atoms in a molecule, providing valuable information about chemical bonding and stereochemistry. This technique is indispensable in organic chemistry, biochemistry, and drug discovery for characterizing complex molecules, such as proteins and pharmaceutical compounds.  Mass spectrometry is another versatile technique used for chemical analysis. Mass spectrometry measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions generated from a sample, allowing for the determination of molecular weights, elemental composition, and structural information. High-resolution mass spectrometry can identify unknown compounds, detect impurities, and quantify analytes in complex mixtures with remarkable sensitivity and specificity. Mass spectrometry is widely employed in environmental analysis, metabolomics, proteomics, and drug screening applications.  Chromatography is another essential technique in chemical analysis, particularly for separating and quantifying components in a mixture. Gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) are the two main branches of chromatography, each offering distinct advantages for different types of analytes. GC is well-suited for volatile and thermally stable compounds, while LC is ideal for analyzing polar and non-volatile substances. Chromatographic techniques are commonly used in pharmaceutical analysis, food testing, environmental monitoring, and forensic investigations to separate and identify individual components within complex samples.  Another critical aspect of chemical analysis is elemental analysis, which involves determining the elemental composition of a sample. Techniques such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) are commonly used for elemental analysis in various industries. XRF enables non-destructive analysis of solid samples for elemental identification, while ICP-OES and AAS offer high sensitivity for quantifying trace metals in liquids and solids.  Besides spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques, thermal analysis methods are also valuable for characterizing materials based on their thermal properties. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are commonly employed to study phase transitions, decomposition temperatures, and thermal stability of polymers, pharmaceuticals, and other materials. By measuring the heat flow or weight change as a function of temperature, thermal analysis techniques provide insights into the thermal behavior and stability of materials.  In recent years, advancements in analytical instrumentation and data processing have revolutionized chemical analysis. High-throughput techniques, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), have significantly increased the speed and efficiency of chemical analysis in research and industrial settings. Additionally, advancements in automation, miniaturization, and data integration have facilitated the development of lab-on-a-chip systems and portable analytical devices for on-site chemical analysis and field measurements.  Furthermore, computational methods, such as quantum chemistry calculations, molecular modeling, and chemoinformatics, play a pivotal role in chemical identification and analysis. These computational tools complement experimental techniques by providing insights into molecular structures, electronic properties, and reaction mechanisms. Molecular modeling techniques, such as molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations, allow researchers to predict the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic level, aiding in drug design, materials discovery, and reaction optimization.  In conclusion, chemical identification and analysis techniques encompass a diverse array of methods that are crucial for understanding the composition, structure, and properties of substances in various fields. From spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques to elemental analysis and thermal methods, these analytical tools enable researchers, scientists, and analysts to unravel the mysteries of molecules, detect contaminants, ensure product quality, and advance scientific knowledge. As technology continues to evolve, the future of chemical analysis holds exciting possibilities for innovative instrumentation, interdisciplinary collaborations, and transformative discoveries in the realm of chemistry and beyond.""","994"
"Buckelew Sarah F  Sarah Frances  1835 ","""If you boil water, and let the steam from it fall upon a cold plate, the steam will change back into liquid and become distilled water. Making a liquid boil, catching the vapor or steam and cooling it, is what we mean by distillation. If two or more liquids are mixed together, the one that boils with the least heat will be drawn off first. The alcohol of beer, cider, and wines is mixed with water; it boils at a lower heat than water, so can be drawn off from it very easily. This does not make more alcohol, it only makes the alcohol stronger by separating it from the water. When beer or any other alcoholic liquor is to be distilled, it is poured into a large copper boiler, called a still, and boiled. A tube carries the vapor from the boiler into a cask filled with cold water. This tube is coiled like a spiral line or worm through the cask; it is called the worm of the still, and the cask is the worm-tub. As the vapor passes through the tube, it cools and drops out at the end into the worm-tub, changed into a liquid stronger in alcohol than that from which it was drawn or distilled. In this way gin is made from beer, brandy from wine, and rum from fermented molasses. These are very strong drinks, and only hard drinkers like them. But very few people begin by taking these; they first learn to like alcohol by drinking cider, beer, or wine, and end with gin, whiskey, or rum when they have become drunkards... Drawing the vapor from a boiling liquid and cooling it.. Machinery for distilling; the boiler which holds the liquid. THE WORM OF THE. The tube which passes from the still to a cask, in which it coils like a worm. WORM-TUB. The cask which holds the tube or worm, and receives the distilled liquid.. A liquid formed by cooled steam..

Grape juice, Hard cider, Gin, Sweet cider, (Malt liquors) Brandy, Root beer, Beer, Whiskey, Ginger beer. Lager beer, Rum. Perry. Ale, Porter, Wine. These soon become fermented; they then contain alcohol. HARM DONE BY IN OF THE BODY. Raw alcohol does not do much harm to people because it is too strong for them to drink much of it; but the alcohol hidden in cider, ale, wine, whiskey, and other alcoholic drinks kills not less than sixty thousand persons in this country every year, besides those who die from its use in other parts of the world. There is great excitement when there is a mad dog around; and, if any one is bitten and dies from the dreadful hydrophobia, people are ready to destroy all the dogs of the neighborhood; but when a drunkard dies from delirium tremens or alcohol craziness, how few take any notice of the cause of his death, or do all they can to wage war against the use of alcoholic liquors. But why do we say such hard things against these liquors which some people love so well and think so harmless? In what way do they hurt and kill people? Let us see. Where does what we drink go after it has been put into the mouth?--'Into the stomach.' If it were the right thing to go into the stomach, into what would it be changed?--'Into something which helps to make good blood.' Learned men, who have examined and carefully studied about these things, tell us that the stomach is hurt by alcohol, because the fiery fluid is not food, but poison which makes the stomach very sore, and gives it hard work to do. The veins of the stomach take it up and send it into the liver. The liver, which is a large organ weighing about four pounds, lies on the right side below the lungs; its work is, to help make the blood pure. It can do nothing with alcohol, so it drives it along to the heart; the heart sends it to the lungs; the lungs throw some of it out through the breath, which smells of the vile stuff that has been poisoning every part it has passed through since it entered the mouth. Some of the alcohol does not get out of the lungs through the breath, but goes with the blood back to the heart, and from the heart is sent through the arteries to every part of the body. No part of the body wants it. The Skin drives some of it out, through its little pores, with the perspiration. The Kidneys, which lie in the back below the waist, on each side of the spine, send off some of the poison. Yet some of it gets into the brain, and there does very much mischief, of which you will learn more by and by. You know, if the brain is hurt, the mind cannot do its work of thinking properly; thus, alcohol does great harm to the mind through the brain. The muscles and the bones are hurt by not being supplied with pure blood; the heart gets tired out with overwork, and the lungs become diseased through this same terrible alcohol. Therefore, if you would be strong and healthy, have nothing to do with alcoholic liquors; for The stomach, The liver, The blood, The heart, The lungs, The brain, The bones, The muscles, The skin, And every part of the body. IN THE. Children who have learned the Lesson on Digestion, and know about the coats of the stomach, about mastication and chyme-making, are easily made to understand why anything which has alcohol in it is unfit to go into the stomach. If we touch a drop of alcohol to the eye, it will make it sore; so alcohol in the stomach irritates its coats and makes them sore. Alcohol poisons the gastric juice. If we get some of this juice from the stomach of a calf which has just been killed, and mix alcohol with it, the alcohol will separate the watery part from the pepsin or white part. This is what alcohol does in the stomach. It takes up water from the gastric juice, which prevents the pepsin from mixing well with the food, and hinders the change of the food into chyme, which cannot take place without pepsin. The children have already learned that alcohol keeps meat from decaying, or going to pieces. We explain that food in the stomach must go to pieces to prepare it to make blood; when mixed with alcohol, it is preserved, and the gastric juice cannot melt or dissolve it. Thus the stomach is hindered from doing its work until it gets rid of the alcohol. A true story we have read will help you to remember how troublesome alcohol is to the stomach. Some men in Edinburgh were paid their wages, one Saturday, soon after they had eaten their dinner. They got drunk and remained so till the next day at noon. When they became sober they had a headache and were so ill that they sent for a doctor; he gave them some medicine which brought up their Saturday's dinner just as it had gone down into the stomach. The poor stomach could do nothing with dinner mixed with whiskey or rum, because these liquors are half alcohol. You have already learned that the stomach hurries to drive out the alcohol into the liver; the liver sends it with the blood into the heart; the heart pours it into the lungs; the lungs breathe it out through the nose and mouth, and tell that some kind of alcoholic liquor has been taken into the stomach. Remember, that the alcohol which comes out in the breath is a part of that which went into the mouth. It could not be changed. It did nothing but mischief in its journey, which shows that it is not food, but poison. God, who created the body, has not given any part of it power to change alcohol into blood. People sometimes take ale or wine because they think it gives them an appetite. This is a great mistake. When any alcoholic liquor goes into the stomach, there is such hard work to get it out that the pain of hunger is not felt; when it is out, the stomach is tired and does not tell the brain that it is hungry. When alcohol is poured into it, day after day, it loses its desire for good, wholesome food, and wants more and more alcoholic liquor. It has an appetite for alcohol. Alcohol makes the stomach sore and full of disease; people who take much of it in liquors always suffer much from dyspepsia. So, if the stomach could speak, it would say: 'Don't pour any alcohol into me, though you mix it and call it ale, cider, wine, or any other name that makes folks think it will do me no harm. You cannot deceive me. I know alcohol as soon as it comes down, and it always makes me suffer.'. -- Burns or inflames the coats of the stomach. Spoils the gastric juice. Makes the food hard to be dissolved. Makes the stomach tired and weak. Takes away the appetite for wholesome food. Makes an appetite for alcoholic liquors. Causes disease in the stomach and other digestive organs. ON. What harm does alcohol do in the stomach? TO THE,, AND SKIN. TO THE.--You have already learned that the bones require to be supplied with good blood to make them strong and healthy, and that alcohol does not make good blood, so we need spend no time in deciding that alcoholic liquors do injury to the bones, and that the bones of those who drink these liquors are less likely to heal, when broken, than those of persons whose blood has not been poisoned by alcohol. TO THE.--The muscles, as you know, cover and move the bones; good blood makes them grow, and keeps them healthy and strong. People like to have plenty of good muscle, for this not only gives them strength, but makes them look plump and well. Alcohol poisons the blood by killing many of the very little, round, red parts in it, called by a long name, which you can learn if you try. This hard name is corpuscles; corpuscle means a little body.""","""Effects of Alcohol on Health""","2106","""Alcohol, a widely consumed beverage across cultures and societies, has both short-term and long-term effects on health. While moderate alcohol consumption may have some potential health benefits, excessive or chronic use of alcohol can lead to a myriad of negative consequences. Understanding the effects of alcohol on health is essential for individuals to make informed decisions about their drinking habits and overall well-being.  In the short term, alcohol can impact the body almost immediately after consumption. When alcohol is ingested, it is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream through the stomach and intestines. This leads to the familiar feeling of intoxication as alcohol affects the brain and central nervous system. The initial effects of alcohol consumption can include feelings of relaxation, lowered inhibitions, impaired judgment, slurred speech, and coordination difficulties. These effects can vary depending on factors such as the type of alcohol consumed, the individual's tolerance level, and whether they have eaten before drinking.  One of the most immediate dangers of alcohol consumption is the risk of alcohol poisoning. Alcohol poisoning can occur when someone drinks a large amount of alcohol in a short period, leading to dangerously high levels of alcohol in the bloodstream. Symptoms of alcohol poisoning include confusion, vomiting, seizures, slow breathing, and unconsciousness. In severe cases, alcohol poisoning can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.  Aside from the immediate effects, long-term alcohol consumption can have serious implications for overall health. Chronic alcohol use can result in liver damage, leading to conditions such as fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The liver plays a crucial role in metabolizing alcohol, and excessive drinking over time can overwhelm its ability to process alcohol efficiently, causing inflammation and scarring.  Alcohol abuse is also associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular issues such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, cardiomyopathy, and an increased risk of stroke. Excessive alcohol consumption can raise triglyceride levels in the blood, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and heart disease. Additionally, alcohol can weaken the heart muscle, impacting its ability to pump blood effectively.  Long-term alcohol abuse is a known risk factor for various types of cancer, including liver, mouth, throat, esophagus, breast, and colorectal cancer. Alcohol is classified as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer due to its role in damaging DNA, promoting inflammation, and interfering with the body's ability to repair damaged cells. Individuals who consume alcohol regularly and in large quantities are at an increased risk of developing these types of cancer compared to non-drinkers or moderate drinkers.  Moreover, alcohol consumption can have detrimental effects on mental health. While some individuals may turn to alcohol as a way to cope with stress or anxiety, excessive drinking can actually exacerbate these conditions. Alcohol is a depressant that affects neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and mood swings. Prolonged alcohol abuse can also contribute to the development of substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health issues.  Another significant impact of alcohol on health is its association with weight gain and obesity. Alcoholic beverages are calorie-dense and can contribute to an increase in overall caloric intake. Alcohol consumption can also stimulate appetite and lead to poor dietary choices, further contributing to weight gain. Excessive alcohol consumption, especially in the form of sugary cocktails or high-calorie beers, can contribute to the accumulation of visceral fat around organs, increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and other obesity-related health conditions.  In addition to its physical and mental health effects, alcohol consumption can also have social and economic repercussions. Alcohol abuse can strain relationships with family and friends, lead to social isolation, and impact work or academic performance. Individuals who struggle with alcohol dependence may experience financial difficulties due to spending a significant portion of their income on alcohol or facing repercussions such as job loss or legal issues related to their drinking behavior.  Despite the negative impacts of alcohol on health, it is important to note that moderate alcohol consumption may have some potential benefits. Some studies suggest that moderate alcohol intake, particularly red wine, may have cardiovascular benefits due to the presence of antioxidants like resveratrol. However, these potential benefits are outweighed by the risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption, and healthcare providers generally do not recommend starting to drink alcohol solely for its potential health benefits.  Overall, understanding the effects of alcohol on health is crucial for individuals to make informed choices about their alcohol consumption. While moderate drinking may not pose significant health risks for most individuals, excessive or chronic alcohol abuse can have far-reaching consequences on physical, mental, and social well-being. Seeking support from healthcare professionals, counselors, or support groups can be instrumental in addressing alcohol-related issues and promoting healthier habits. By prioritizing health and well-being, individuals can reduce the negative impacts of alcohol on their lives and pave the way for a healthier future.""","989"
"De Quincey Thomas","""'How readest thou?' was the question of Christ himself; that is, in what meaning dost thou read the particular Scripture that applies to this case? All the texts and all the cases remain at this hour just as they were for our ancestors; and our reverence for these texts is as absolute as theirs; but we, applying lights of experience which they had not, construe these texts by a different logic. There now is development applied to the Bible in one of its many strata--that stratum which connects itself most with civil polity. Again, what a development have we made of Christian truth; how differently do we now read our Bibles in relation to the poor tenants of dungeons that once were thought, even by Christian nations, to have no rights at all!--in relation to 'all prisoners and captives;' and in relation to slaves! The New Testament had said nothing directly upon the question of slavery; nay, by the misreader it was rather supposed indirectly to countenance that institution. But mark--it is Mohammedanism, having little faith in its own laws, that dares not confide in its children for developing anything, but must tie them up for every contingency by the letter of a rule. Christianity--how differently does she proceed! She throws herself broadly upon the pervading spirit which burns within her morals. 'Let them alone,' she says of nations; 'leave them to themselves. I have put a new law into their hearts; and if it is really there, and really cherished, that law will tell them--will develop for them--what it is that they ought to do in every case as it arises, when once its consequences are comprehended.' No need, therefore, for the New Testament explicitly to forbid slavery; silently and implicitly it is forbidden in many passages of the New Testament, and it is at war with the spirit of all. Besides, the religion which trusts to formal and literal rules breaks down the very moment that a new case arises not described in the rules. Such a case is virtually unprovided for, if it does not answer to a circumstantial textual description; whereas every case is provided for, as soon as its tendencies and its moral relations are made known, by a religion that speaks through a spiritual organ to a spiritual apprehension in man. Accordingly, we find that, whenever a new mode of intoxication is introduced, not depending upon grapes, the most devout Mussulmans hold themselves absolved from the restraints of the Koran. And so it would have been with Christians, if the New Testament had laid down literal prohibitions of slavery, or of the slave traffic. Thousands of variations would have been developed by time which no letter of Scripture could have been comprehensive enough to reach. Were the domestic servants of Greece, the (thetes), within the description? Were the serfs and the ascripti glebae of feudal Europe to be accounted slaves? Or those amongst our own brothers and sisters, that within so short a period were born subterraneously, in Scottish mines, or in the English collieries of Cumberland, and were supposed to be ascripti metallo, sold by nature to the mine, and indorsed upon its machinery for the whole term of their lives; in whom, therefore, it was a treason to see the light of upper day--would they, would these poor Scotch and English Pariahs, have stood within any scriptural privilege if the New Testament had legislated by name and letter for this class of douloi (slaves)? No attorney would have found them entitled to plead the benefit of the Bible statute. Endless are the variations of the conditions that new combinations of society would bring forward; endless would be the virtual restorations of slavery that would take place under a Mahometan literality; endless would be the defeats that such restorations must sustain under a Christianity relying on no letter, but on the spirit of God's commandments, and that will understand no equivocations with the secret admonitions of the heart. Meantime, this sort of development, it may be objected, is not a light that Scripture throws out upon human life so much as a light that human life and its development throw back upon Scripture. True; but then how was it possible that life and the human intellect should be carried forward to such developments? Solely through the training which both had received under the discipline of Christian truth. Christianity utters some truth widely applicable to society. This truth is caught up by some influential organ of social life--is expanded prodigiously by human experience, and, when travelling back as an illustrated or improved text to the Bible, is found to be made up, in all its details, of many human developments. Does that argue anything disparaging to Christianity, as though she contributed little and man contributed much? On the contrary, man would have contributed nothing at all but for that nucleus by which Christianity started and moulded the principle. To give one instance--Public charity, when did it commence?--who first thought of it? Who first noticed hunger and cold as awful realities afflicting poor women and innocent children? Who first made a public provision to meet these evils?--Constantine it was, the first Christian that sat upon a throne. Had, then, rich Pagans before his time no charity--no pity?--no money available for hopeless poverty? Not much--very little, I conceive; about so much as Shakspeare insinuates that there is of milk in a male tiger. Think, for instance, of that black-hearted reprobate, Cicero, the moralist. This moral knave, who wrote such beautiful Ethics, and was so wicked--who spoke so charmingly and acted so horribly--mentions, with a petrifying coolness, that he knew of desolate old women in Rome who passed three days in succession without tasting food. Did not the wretch, when thinking of this, leap up, and tumble down stairs in his anxiety to rush abroad and call a public meeting for considering so dreadful a case? Not he; the man continued to strut about his library, in a huge toga as big as the Times newspaper, singing out, 'Oh! fortunatam natam me Consule Romam!' and he mentioned the fact at all only for the sake of Natural Philosophers or of the curious in old women. Charity, even in that sense, had little existence--nay, as a duty, it had no place or rubric in human conceptions before Christianity, Thence came the first rudiments of all public relief to starving men and women; but the idea, the principle, was all that the Bible furnished, needed to furnish, or could furnish. The practical arrangements, the endless details for carrying out this Christian idea--these were furnished by man; and why not? This case illustrates only one amongst innumerable modes of development applicable to the Bible; and this power of development, in general, proves also one other thing of the last importance to prove, viz. the power of Christianity to work in co-operation with time and social progress; to work variably according to the endless variations of time and place; and that is the exact shibboleth of a true and spiritual religion--for, on reviewing the history of false religions, and inquiring what it was that ruined them, rarely is it found that any of them perished by external violence. Even the dreadful fury of the early Mahometan Sultans in India, before the house of Timour, failed to crush the monstrous idolatries of the Hindoos. All false religions have perished by their own hollowness, under that searching trial applied by social life and its changes, which awaits every mode of religion. One after another they have sunk away, as by palsy, from new aspects of society and new necessities of man which they were not able to face. Commencing in one condition of society, in one set of feelings, and in one system of ideas, they sank uniformly under any great change in these elements, to which they had no natural power of accommodation. A false religion furnished a key to one subordinate lock; but a religion that is true will prove a master-key for all locks alike. This transcendental principle, by which Christianity transfers herself so readily from climate to climate,""","""Christianity and social development dynamics""","1700","""Christianity has played a significant role in shaping social development dynamics throughout history. From its inception over two millennia ago, Christianity has influenced societies, cultures, laws, education, and even economies. This religion, centered around the teachings of Jesus Christ, has had a profound impact on the values, ethics, and moral compass of individuals and communities globally. In this discussion, we will delve into the intricate relationship between Christianity and social development dynamics, exploring how the principles and practices of this faith have contributed to societal progress and challenges.  One of the foundational principles of Christianity is the belief in the intrinsic value and dignity of every human being. This idea, rooted in the concept of being created in the image of God, has had a transformative effect on social structures and norms. Throughout history, Christian teachings have advocated for the protection of the vulnerable, the care of the poor and marginalized, and the promotion of justice and equality. These principles have inspired numerous social movements aimed at eradicating slavery, promoting civil rights, and advocating for humanitarian causes.  The Christian emphasis on love, compassion, and forgiveness has also played a vital role in shaping social interactions and relationships. The concept of loving one's neighbor as oneself has led to acts of kindness, charity, and community service carried out by Christian individuals and organizations worldwide. From establishing hospitals and schools to providing disaster relief and advocating for human rights, Christianity has been at the forefront of social development efforts, seeking to address the needs of the most vulnerable in society.  Moreover, the moral framework provided by Christianity has influenced legal systems and governance structures in many countries. The Ten Commandments, with its emphasis on ethical behavior and respect for authority, has served as a basis for shaping laws and regulations that govern human behavior. The Christian belief in the importance of honesty, integrity, and accountability has contributed to the development of a just and equitable legal system in numerous societies.  Education has also been profoundly impacted by Christianity, with the Church historically being a patron of the arts, sciences, and scholarship. Many of the world's most prestigious universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge, and Harvard, have Christian roots and were founded to educate clergy and promote learning. The emphasis on pursuing knowledge, critical thinking, and intellectual inquiry has been a driving force behind advancements in various fields, contributing to social progress and development.  At the same time, the relationship between Christianity and social development dynamics has not been without challenges and controversies. Throughout history, the Church has been criticized for its involvement in politics, its role in conflicts and wars, and its resistance to certain scientific advancements. The Crusades, the Inquisition, and the Galileo affair are just a few examples of how Christianity's influence has sometimes led to negative consequences for society.  In contemporary times, Christianity continues to be a driving force in social development dynamics, with millions of believers actively engaged in humanitarian work, social justice initiatives, and community development projects. From fighting poverty and inequality to promoting environmental sustainability and reconciliation efforts, Christians are at the forefront of addressing the pressing challenges facing our world today.  In conclusion, Christianity has had a profound impact on social development dynamics, shaping societal values, norms, and institutions. The principles of love, compassion, justice, and equality espoused by this faith have inspired individuals and communities to work towards a more just, peaceful, and inclusive society. While there have been challenges and criticisms along the way, the overall influence of Christianity on social development has been a force for good, promoting human flourishing and societal progress.""","697"

How a progressive effect results from the simple continuance of the cause. and from the progressiveness of the cause. Derivative laws generated from a single ultimate law 6 Chapter XVI. Of Empirical Laws.. Definition of an empirical law. Derivative laws commonly depend on collocations. The collocations of the permanent causes are not reducible to any law.

It provides a structured framework for conducting scientific research and gathering knowledge. The process typically involves making observations, asking questions, forming hypotheses, conducting experiments, analyzing data, and drawing conclusions. The Scientific Method is an essential tool for scientists and researchers in various fields, allowing them to test hypotheses rigorously and establish reliable conclusions based on empirical evidence.  The first step of the Scientific Method is observation. Scientists carefully observe natural phenomena or conduct experiments to gather data. Observations can be qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (involving measurements). Through observation, scientists identify patterns, trends, or inconsistencies that spark curiosity and lead to the formulation of questions. These questions are the foundation of scientific inquiry, driving the research process forward.  After making observations and formulating questions, scientists develop hypotheses to explain the observed phenomena. A hypothesis is a testable explanation or prediction based on existing knowledge or preliminary observations. It represents a proposed solution to the research question and serves as a starting point for further investigation. A good hypothesis is specific, falsifiable, and supported by evidence or logical reasoning.  The next step in the Scientific Method is experimentation. Scientists design and conduct experiments to test the validity of their hypotheses. Experiments involve manipulating variables, collecting data, and analyzing the results to determine whether the hypothesis is supported or refuted. Proper experimental design is crucial to ensuring the reliability and validity of the findings. Control groups, randomization, and replication are common strategies used to minimize bias and variability in experimental outcomes.  Data analysis is a critical component of the Scientific Method. Scientists examine the data collected during experiments to identify patterns, correlations, or significant differences. Statistical analysis is often employed to determine the significance of the results and draw meaningful conclusions. Data visualization techniques such as graphs, charts, and tables are used to present findings in a clear and understandable manner.  Based on the results of the experiments and data analysis, scientists draw conclusions regarding the validity of their hypotheses. Conclusions may support or refute the initial hypothesis, leading to further refinement or revision of scientific ideas. It is essential for scientists to communicate their findings accurately and transparently, documenting the methods used and the limitations of the study.  Scientific laws are statements that describe natural phenomena or relationships observed through repeated experimentation and validation. Laws are concise explanations of how the natural world behaves under certain conditions. Unlike theories, which are broader explanations supported by a body of evidence, laws are specific and well-defined principles that govern a particular aspect of nature.  Scientific laws are based on empirical observations and have withstood the test of time and scrutiny. They are often expressed in mathematical terms to provide precise descriptions of natural phenomena. Examples of scientific laws include Newton's Laws of Motion, the Law of Conservation of Energy, and the Law of Gravity. These laws have been extensively tested and validated through experimentation, making them fundamental principles in their respective fields of study.  In conclusion, the Scientific Method is a systematic approach to scientific inquiry that guides researchers in exploring the natural world and generating knowledge. By following the steps of observation, hypothesis formulation, experimentation, data analysis, and conclusion drawing, scientists can advance our understanding of the universe. Scientific laws, on the other hand, are concise explanations of natural phenomena that have been rigorously tested and validated. Together, the Scientific Method and scientific laws form the cornerstone of modern scientific practice, enabling us to unravel the mysteries of the universe and make meaningful discoveries.""","698"

Before embarking on any such project, it is essential to understand the approval process involved. The approval process for sanitary engineering projects is a systematic procedure that ensures compliance with regulations, standards, and best practices to safeguard public health and the environment.  The first step in the approval process involves project planning and design. This phase necessitates thorough site investigation, feasibility studies, and detailed engineering design to ensure that the proposed sanitary engineering project meets the technical requirements and is environmentally sound. The project design should consider factors such as population density, hydraulic conductivity of soil, topography, and existing infrastructure to determine the most suitable design for the project.  Once the project design is finalized, the next step is to prepare and submit the necessary documentation for approval. This typically includes detailed engineering drawings, technical specifications, environmental impact assessments, and any other relevant reports required by regulatory authorities. The documentation should demonstrate how the project complies with applicable codes, standards, and regulations governing sanitary engineering projects.  After the documentation is submitted, regulatory authorities such as local government agencies, environmental protection agencies, and public health departments review the project proposal. They assess the design, environmental impact, public health implications, and compliance with relevant regulations. Depending on the scale and scope of the project, the approval process may involve multiple levels of review by different regulatory bodies.  During the review process, regulatory authorities may request additional information, clarification, or modifications to the project design to address any concerns or non-compliance issues. It is essential for project developers to collaborate closely with regulatory agencies, respond promptly to requests for information, and make necessary revisions to the project proposal as needed to obtain approval.  In some cases, public consultation may be required as part of the approval process for major sanitary engineering projects. Public consultation allows stakeholders, including local residents, community groups, and other interested parties, to provide feedback, raise concerns, and offer suggestions regarding the project. Engaging the public early in the approval process helps build support for the project and address any potential issues proactively.  Once the regulatory authorities are satisfied with the project proposal and all concerns have been addressed, they grant approval for the sanitary engineering project to proceed. Approval may be subject to specific conditions, such as implementing mitigation measures, monitoring environmental impacts, or complying with certain operational requirements. Project developers must adhere to these conditions to ensure ongoing compliance and successful implementation of the project.  After receiving approval, the next phase involves obtaining permits and licenses necessary for construction and operation. This may include permits for land use, water discharge, air emissions, and other activities related to the project. Proper permitting is essential to ensure legal compliance and avoid potential delays or fines during project execution.  Throughout the construction and operation phases of the sanitary engineering project, regulatory compliance and monitoring are essential to ensure that the project continues to meet all applicable standards and regulations. Regular inspections, environmental monitoring, and reporting requirements may be imposed to verify compliance and address any issues that may arise during the project lifecycle.  In conclusion, the approval process for sanitary engineering projects involves a thorough and comprehensive review of project proposals to ensure compliance with regulations, standards, and best practices. By following the prescribed approval process, project developers can demonstrate their commitment to public health, environmental protection, and sustainable development. Effective communication, collaboration with regulatory authorities, and adherence to requirements are key to securing approval and successfully implementing sanitary engineering projects that benefit society and the environment.""","690"
"Morton Samuel George","""There is, moreover, a passage in Syncellus which directly asserts that the Hindoos, who, as we have observed, are sometimes called Ethiopians in ancient history, formed colonies in Egypt. thiopes ab Indo fluvio profecti, supra gyptum sedem sibi eligerunt. Heeren, from whom I derive this quotation, remarks, that as the Hindoos would necessarily arrive by sea, they would establish themselves on the coast. We grant it; but a commercial and migratory people would soon find their way to the great mart of Meroe, and thence to every part of the Egyptian provinces. It has been observed by Mr. Bonomi, that the affiliation of the Hindoos with the people of the upper Nile is confirmed by the affinity which exists between the Ethiopic and Sanscrit systems of writing, as pointed out by Dr. Wall and Mr. Tudor. Dr. Prichard, whose profound investigations into this and all other questions in ethnography, command our highest respect, while he admits that great difficulties present themselves in the present inquiry, remarks that a common origin, if not of the races themselves, at least of the mental culture characteristic of both of them, has been proved; and that the people of India and of Egypt derived from one source the first principles of all their peculiarities of thought and action, of their religious and social observances, and civil and political institutions; and that these principles had even been developed to a considerable extent, before the nations themselves were entirely cut off from communication with each other or with a common centre. It has been proved by the philosophic Heeren, that Meroe was the grand emporium of the trade between the richest and most productive portions of the earth; the gold countries of eastern Africa, the spice lands of India, and the region of frankincense and precious stones in southern Arabia. He has shown that the communication between these countries was established in the most ancient periods, and continued without interruption through successive ages of time; that the ruins of Adule, Azab, and Axum, yet mark the caravan routes between Meroe and Arabia Felix; and that Yemen, though separated from India by an open sea, is yet connected with it by nature in an extraordinary manner. One half of the year, he adds, from spring to autumn, the wind regularly sets in and wafts the vessels from Arabia to India; the other half, from autumn to spring, it as regularly carries them back from India to Arabia. In truth, what Diodorus says, in general, of early Egyptian commerce and conquest by sea, need be no longer regarded as fabulous, although the details, like much that we glean from the remote history of all heathen nations, are to be received with circumspection. He tells us that out a fleet of four hundred ships in the Arabian gulf, with which he conquered all the countries bordering on the Erythrean sea, as far as India, whence he led an army beyond the Ganges until he again reached the ocean. This account is not likely to be all fable, especially since it comes from a Greek historian; and we may safely regard it as an indication of that extensive maritime enterprise in which the Egyptians engaged with the southern nations of Asia. When the Romans under the guidance of Hippalus, eighty years after their conquest of Egypt, began to trade with India by way of the Red Sea and Malabar, they only re-established the ancient route, which had been long forgotten amidst the chaos of political revolutions. In fine, if the Egyptians had been their own historians, we should probably learn that they were as familiar with India in ancient as the English are in modern times. While we conclude, therefore, that the Egyptians were a distinct people from either the Arabs or Hindoos, we cannot deny those resemblances which are too obvious to be mistaken, yet not to be accounted for without difficulty; nor can there be a reasonable doubt that the people of both these nations formed an important part of the once multitudinous population of Egypt. --. THE. There is no fact in history more familiar than the rule of the Hykshos or shepherd kings in Egypt. The word Hykshos is the same as we have in the Egyptian and Berber or Libyan tongues, and signified a shepherd or a wanderer. It was applied to all those foreigners who at different times displaced the native dynasties, Scythians, Hellenic tribes, Phenicians, and others. Reserving some remarks for a future part of this memoir, we shall briefly observe that there is no monumental record of more than one of these sovereignties, namely, that which was expelled by Amunoph the First of the eighteenth dynasty, about eighteen centuries before Christ. These people, whose name was held in execration by the Egyptians, are said by Herodotus and other historians to have possessed a fair complexion, blue eyes, and reddish hair. That they were of the Caucasian race there is no question; but the preceding traits apply equally to the Scythians, the Phenicians, and the Edomim or Edomites, and it is probable that the shepherd dynasties of Manetho embraced kings from all these sources. The portraits of these intrusive kings, as recently discovered in various parts of Egypt, not only present a physiognomy entirely different from that of the legitimate monarchs, but the symbol of their religion is also different, being the sun, whose rays terminate in human hands, while the accompanying hieroglyphic legends make no allusion to the Egyptian deities. Their features, observes Mr. Perring, from whom I derive these facts, do not at all resemble the Egyptian; and, though much defaced, are evidently the same as those found on the propyla of Karnak, where we may recognise a similarity with the tall, white, slender, blue-eyed, and red-haired race, painted on the soles of the Egyptian sandals, and appearing also on the monuments, where they are emphatically called the wicked race of Scheto. One of these effigies is found only on fragments of stone which had pertained to temples antecedent to the eighteenth dynasty, which structures were overturned by the legitimate kings of that and the succeeding reigns, and the materials used in erecting those splendid Pharaonic monuments of which they yet form a part. The three following heads are copied from Mr. Perrings very interesting memoir. No., the portrait of a king whose name is read Skai by Champollion, copied from his tomb in the western valley near Thebes. The bold, heavy features, and harsh expression are very remarkable, and Mr. Perring observes that this personage is represented of a much lighter red than is usual with the Egyptians. No.. Head of another king of this exotic dynasty, with long sharp features, whose name reads Atenre-Backhan on the monuments, copied from a stone in the second propylon of Karnak. No.. Another effigy of the same king, from the grottoes of El Tell, of which Mr. Perring remarks, that having been copied in haste it is somewhat in caricature. El Tell, or Tel-el-Amarna, appears to have been the stronghold of these foreign marauders, respecting whom Mr. Gliddon, after suggesting the probability that the sovereigns may have been of Arabian origin, inquires whether the present inhabitants, whose village occupies the once warlike camp or city of Atenre, have in their views and in their physical conformation, some vestiges of that early tribe of heterodox conquerors? And may not then the cause of the almost instinctive terror with which the natives of other parts of Egypt regard this vicinity, proceed from vague traditions of ancient predatory habits, some fitful legend that has outlived thirty-five centuries? There are many effigies of the same general character of the age of the fourth Rameses. One of them, a captive, is figured in the margin. Wilkinson reads their name Tochari on the monuments; Rosellini translates it Fekkaro. To my view they have the lined and hardy features of the Celts or Gauls, of whom, however, we have little knowledge at that remote date, (B.C. 400,) although even then they occupied a large part of southern Europe. They perhaps rather pertain to the Phenician branch of the Caucasian race. There are other paintings, especially some at Abousimbel of the age of Rameses III., which correspond in every particular with the Scythian physiognomy as recorded in history; and the name of Scheto, by which they are designated on the monuments, confirms the suggestion of the hieroglyphists that they represent a Scythian or Scytho-Bactrian people. The researches of Lord Lindsay seem to prove that the Assyrians were also among the Hykshos conquerors of Egypt; and the shepherds who invaded Egypt before the time of Abraham are called Cushim by the ancients, which means Ethiopians or Babylonians; for the country on both sides of the Persian Gulf was called Cush. Plutarch, quoting Manetho, asserts that Tiphonean or red-haired men were sacrificed in the temples of Eletheias, and their ashes scattered to the winds. Was this done in commemoration of the hatred which the Egyptians bore to the red-haired Hykshos? --. THE. From various antecedent remarks it will be perceived that I regard the Copts as a mixed community, derived in diverse proportions from the Caucasian and the Negro; and this diversity of origin may explain the dissimilar characteristics which travellers have ascribed to them.""","""Ancient Egypt and Ethnic Interactions""","2010","""Ancient Egypt stood as a civilization that thrived for millennia along the fertile banks of the Nile River. Its rich history was marked by a tapestry of ethnicities that interacted and influenced each other, shaping the diverse cultural landscape of this ancient land. From the predynastic periods to the height of its power in the New Kingdom, Egypt was a melting pot of peoples, ideas, and traditions.  The ethnic landscape of Ancient Egypt was not homogenous; rather, it was a mosaic of various groups that interacted and coexisted within the borders of this ancient civilization. The native population of Egypt, known as the """"Kemet,"""" primarily consisted of the indigenous people of the Nile Valley. They were joined by other groups such as the Nubians from the south, the Libyans from the west, and the Asiatics from the northeast. These diverse ethnicities brought their own customs, languages, and beliefs, enriching the cultural fabric of Egypt.  One of the key aspects of ethnic interactions in Ancient Egypt was the process of cultural assimilation. As different ethnic groups came into contact through trade, conquest, or migration, they often assimilated into Egyptian society while also preserving elements of their own culture. This interchange of traditions and practices led to a syncretism that characterized much of Egyptian art, religion, and daily life. For example, the worship of foreign deities like the Nubian goddess Hathor or the Canaanite god Bes was integrated into the Egyptian pantheon.  The interaction between ethnic groups also extended to areas such as trade, diplomacy, and warfare. Egypt's strategic location at the crossroads of Africa and the Middle East facilitated contact with neighboring regions, leading to the exchange of goods, ideas, and technologies. Trade routes like the famous incense trail connected Egypt to distant lands, allowing for the importation of exotic goods such as myrrh, ebony, and gold. Moreover, diplomatic relations with foreign powers like the Hittites and the Mitanni played a crucial role in shaping Egypt's foreign policy and expanding its sphere of influence.  Military campaigns and conquests were another arena where ethnic interactions played a significant role in shaping Ancient Egypt's history. The expansion of Egypt's borders under pharaohs like Thutmose III and Ramesses II brought the empire into contact with a diverse array of ethnic groups, leading to both conflict and cultural exchange. The military campaigns in Nubia, for instance, not only brought the region under Egyptian control but also resulted in the adoption of Nubian customs and practices in Egyptian society.  Despite the dynamic nature of ethnic interactions in Ancient Egypt, the society was governed by a rigid social hierarchy that placed the pharaoh at the pinnacle of power. The king was not only a political leader but also a religious figure who embodied the divine order of the universe. Below the pharaoh were the nobility, priests, scribes, and craftsmen who played essential roles in maintaining the stability and prosperity of the kingdom. At the bottom of the social hierarchy were the common people, including farmers, laborers, and slaves, whose daily lives were shaped by their roles in the economy and society.  Religion played a central role in shaping ethnic interactions in Ancient Egypt. The polytheistic belief system of the Egyptians encompassed a vast pantheon of gods and goddesses associated with cosmic forces, natural phenomena, and human activities. Each deity had a specific domain and cult center where they were worshiped through rituals, offerings, and festivals. The assimilation of foreign deities into the Egyptian religious landscape reflected the inclusive nature of Egyptian religion and its ability to accommodate diverse beliefs.  The pharaoh, as the divine ruler of Egypt, was closely linked to the religious practices of the kingdom. The king served as the intermediary between the gods and the people, ensuring the prosperity and well-being of the land through rituals conducted in temples and funerary complexes. The famous temples of Karnak, Luxor, and Abu Simbel stand as testaments to the grandeur and piety of Ancient Egyptian religion, where ethnic communities came together to worship and honor the gods.  Art and architecture were also important mediums through which ethnic interactions were expressed in Ancient Egypt. The grand monuments, tombs, and sculptures that have survived to the present day showcase the artistic achievements of this civilization and the influences of different ethnic groups. The blending of Egyptian, Nubian, and Near Eastern artistic styles is evident in the reliefs of the Amarna period or the colossal statues of pharaohs like Amenhotep III.  In conclusion, Ancient Egypt was a vibrant tapestry of ethnic interactions that shaped the cultural, social, and political landscape of this ancient civilization. The diverse ethnic groups that inhabited Egypt brought their own traditions, beliefs, and customs, contributing to the rich tapestry of Egyptian society. Through trade, diplomacy, religion, and art, these ethnic interactions left a lasting legacy that continues to captivate and inspire us today.""","995"
"Day Clive","""The Scandinavians have left records of adventurous voyages to the North and West, and a vast number of silver coins found in Russia and the Baltic countries shows that a land trade with southwestern Asia persisted in the period of which we treat. It is only toward the close of this period, however, that we begin to get details about distant commerce, and can see that it is firmly established. The Institutes of London, issued in the eleventh century, and regulating the commerce of the town, mention ships coming from Flanders, from Rouen and other places in France, and from Germany. Foreign merchants bought wool and pigs, and sold wine, furs, spices, gloves, and fish. =2. Character of the merchant in the early Middle Ages.= We know even less of the person of the merchant, in this period (about 000 A.D.), than of the wares that he carried. It is certain, at any rate, that the merchant was not the specialist that he afterwards became, but was a jack-of-all-trades. He might be wholesaler and retailer, transporter and pedler, and often an artisan too. Nothing like the country store of the present day existed, and trade outside the few centers where markets had been established was carried on by pedlers, who carried their wares on the back or on a pack animal. Every merchant was sure to be something of a soldier, as he was thrown largely on his own resources for self-defence; and he often assumed the garb of a missionary or pilgrim to get the help of the church in carrying on his trade. The pilgrim was exempt from many burdens laid on the ordinary traveler or merchant, and though this exemption had later to be abolished, because it was so frequently abused, it seems to have been of great use in helping commerce through its early stages.

The best account of the feudal system in English is Seignobos, Feudal regime, N. Y., Holt, 903.

See, therefore, Cunningham, Growth, vol., book, or the smaller manuals on English economic history. VI TOWN =3. Significance of towns in the economic organization; decline of the Roman towns.= In the latter part of the Middle Ages, beginning after the year 000, a striking change took place in the life of Europe; the people advanced so rapidly in their economic and political organization that we can make this a new era in their history. It will be necessary to notice the important changes in detail, but we can summarize them now, from the economic standpoint, by saying that people advanced from the stage of the village or manor to that of the town. A town, as the word will be used here, means a group of at least several hundred, perhaps several thousand people, settled closely together, and maintaining themselves in large part by manufactures and trade. Such towns had existed, as noted above, in the Roman Empire of the West. In Roman were over one hundred of them. They depended for their existence, however, on the stimulus of Roman culture, and on the security which good government could afford to their trade. A manufacturing class evidently could not eat the wares it made, and needed the chance to exchange them for food products from the country districts if it was to maintain itself. In the period before, during, and after the German invasions the chance for exchange grew steadily less, as we have seen. Some of the towns were entirely destroyed in the period of disorder which followed the fall of the Roman government. London, for instance, which had been a flourishing town under Roman rule, must have become a mere heap of rubbish, for when it was rebuilt in later times no attempt was made to follow the lines of the old streets, and new streets were laid out over the ruins of former houses. When a town was not actually destroyed it ceased to live; the inhabitants had to take to agriculture to support themselves, and the town shrank to a mere village, which could not be distinguished from the manors about it. Of more than 00 modern French cities scarcely 0 can be traced back to the Roman period, and all of these lost their identity as towns and became simple villages in the intervening time. =4. Rise of towns after 000; conditions determining their location.= We read of towns in Europe before the year 000 but they scarcely deserve the name; they were rather the germs from which towns were later to spring. Considerable numbers of people would collect in the place where some great feudal lord spent most of his time, or where a monastery had been founded; garrisons would be established at places suitable for military operations. We must regard such groups, however, as supported by taxation rather than by the trade of individuals, from which most urban groups arise. Trade of this kind became, however, so considerable after the year 000 that real towns grew up in constantly increasing numbers. Their position was determined by two important conditions of existence, political protection and the chance for profitable trade. People found the former by nestling under the walls of some castle or monastery; the many French towns which bear the name of some saint show how much the protection of the church was prized. The latter object was generally attained by founding the town at some break in a line of transportation, where goods had to be transshipped and where merchants would naturally congregate to rest and exchange their wares (cf. Ox-ford, Cam-bridge, etc.). We find the most considerable towns, therefore, along the seacoast and rivers, and at breaks or intersections of the land routes. =5/8. Development of manufacturing in the towns.= The rise of the towns brought with it, as has been suggested, a new era in manufactures. In the ordinary village it did not pay men to specialize in the production of wares, as the market was so small. A shoemaker, for instance, could not make a living by selling 0 or 00 pairs of shoes a year. If we think, however, of a village growing into a town surrounded by a considerable country population, we see that the market has widened into an area of size sufficient to support a number of specialists. Manufacturing became a profession to which men devoted most of their time. A man could learn his trade much more thoroughly, and could afford to make the tools which would enable him to exercise it most efficiently. The result was an increase in production which enabled the people on a given area to live far more comfortably than they had done before. =6. Effect of the towns in improving the conditions in the country.= This movement was bound to change the conditions of life in the country districts. The people there were freed from the necessity of devoting part of their time to work which they never did well; they could apply most of their energy to agriculture, and could use the surplus crop which they thus obtained, for a profitable exchange with the artisans of the town. The growth of towns affected them in another way. In the purely manorial period a serf could not better his condition by running away; he had nowhere to go except to other manors like the one he had left, where his condition might actually be worse than before. In the towns, however, practically all the population were free; the artisans were numerous and intelligent enough to provide for their own protection, and did not need to subject themselves to a lord. The towns were islands of freedom in a sea of serfdom or of half-freedom. The custom established itself that a serf who could escape from his lord, and who lived a year and a day within the walls of a town, became a free man, and could not be reduced to his former position.""","""Early Medieval Commerce and Town Development""","1968","""Early Medieval Commerce and Town Development  During the Early Medieval period, spanning roughly from the 5th to the 10th century in Europe, the landscape of commerce and urban development underwent significant transformations. This pivotal era, often referred to as the Dark Ages, was marked by the decline of the Roman Empire and the rise of various kingdoms and empires across the continent. Amidst this political and social upheaval, commerce played a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape and fostering the growth of towns and cities.  At the outset of the Early Medieval period, Europe experienced a decline in long-distance trade networks established during the Roman era. With the fragmentation of the Roman Empire, the once-flourishing trade routes connecting different regions began to deteriorate. As a result, local and regional economies became more self-sufficient, with communities relying on nearby resources for sustenance and trade. This shift towards localized economies laid the foundation for the development of towns as centers for economic activity.  One of the key factors that contributed to the growth of towns during the Early Medieval period was the revival of trade within Europe. While long-distance trade had declined, local and regional trade thrived as communities sought to exchange surplus goods and resources. Towns emerged as hubs for trade, offering a centralized location for merchants and artisans to conduct business. Markets became a common feature of these towns, where goods were bought and sold, fostering economic exchange and specialization of labor.  The development of towns was also influenced by the rise of feudalism during this period. Feudalism, a social and economic system based on land ownership and obligations between lords and vassals, led to the establishment of manors and villages surrounding castles and fortifications. Towns often grew around these centers of power, creating a network of settlements that supported each other economically. Craftsmen, traders, and serfs found opportunities in these burgeoning towns, contributing to their growth and prosperity.  As towns flourished, they began to attract settlers seeking economic opportunities and protection. The presence of markets, fairs, and guilds further fueled the growth of towns as commercial and social hubs. In addition to trade, towns became centers of culture, learning, and administration, with the emergence of churches, schools, and government institutions. The establishment of charters by royal or noble authorities granted towns various privileges, such as self-governance and rights to trade, further stimulating their development.  The expansion of towns during the Early Medieval period was also influenced by technological advancements and innovations. The adoption of new agricultural techniques, such as the heavy plow and three-field system, led to increased agricultural productivity, freeing up labor for non-agricultural pursuits. Improvements in transportation, such as better roads and bridges, facilitated trade between towns and regions, enhancing economic connectivity and growth.  Furthermore, the role of monasteries and religious institutions cannot be understated in the development of towns during the Early Medieval period. Monasteries served as centers of learning, craftsmanship, and agricultural innovation, contributing to the overall economic and cultural progress of the surrounding areas. Monastic communities often provided stability and support to nearby towns, acting as both spiritual and economic anchors in the ever-changing medieval world.  In conclusion, Early Medieval commerce and town development were intertwined processes that shaped the economic and social landscape of Europe during a period of significant transition. The revival of trade, the influence of feudalism, technological advancements, and the impact of religious institutions all played a vital role in the growth and prosperity of towns during this era. By understanding the factors that contributed to the development of towns in the Early Medieval period, we gain insights into the complex interplay of economic, social, and political forces that laid the groundwork for the urban centers we see today.""","750"

This was also true for the methods of chemical degradation, carried out in order to find the components of nucleins in their highest state of natural complexity. It was learned for example, that the special kind of carbohydrate present in nucleins was very susceptible to change under the conditions of hydrolysis by acids.

The two main types are DNA and RNA. Purifying nucleic acids is crucial for applications like sequencing and cloning. Common methods include phenol-chloroform extraction, silica-based column purification, and ethanol precipitation. Phenol-chloroform extraction separates nucleic acids from proteins and other contaminants based on their solubility. Silica-based column purification uses binding and elution steps to isolate nucleic acids. Ethanol precipitation relies on the differential solubility of nucleic acids in alcohol solutions. Each method has its advantages and limitations based on factors like yield, purity, and ease of use. Researchers often choose a method based on the specific requirements of their experiment. Purified nucleic acids are crucial for accurate downstream analysis, ensuring reliable results. Advances in purification techniques have led to increased efficiency and purity levels, enabling researchers to uncover intricate details of genetic information with precision. Proper purification of nucleic acids is fundamental in various scientific fields and plays a vital role in advancing our understanding of genetics and molecular biology.""","222"
"Arachne","""And revenge never can be a duty. Hamlet thinks much, continues Maeterlinck, but is by no means wise. Destiny can withstand lofty thoughts but not simple, good, tender and loyal thoughts. We only triumph over destiny by doing the reverse of the evil she would have us commit. No tragedy is inevitable. But at Elsinore no one had vision--no one saw--hence the catastrophe. The soul that saw would have made others see. Because of Hamlet's pitiful blindness, Laertes, Ophelia, the King, Queen, and Hamlet die. Was his blindness inevitable? A single thought had sufficed to arrest all the forces of murder. Hamlet's ignorance puts the seal on his unhappiness, and his shadow lay on Horatio, who lacked the courage to shake himself free. Had there been one brave soul to cry out the truth, the history of Elsinore had not been shrouded in horror. All depended not on destiny, but on the wisdom of the wisest, and this Hamlet was; therefore he was the centre of the drama of Elsinore, for he had no one wiser than himself on whom to depend. Maeterlinck's doctrine of the soul and its power over Destiny is very captivating, but it is doubtful if he was fortunate in his choice of Hamlet as an example of ignorance and blindness, and of failure to conquer fate, through lack of soul-power. How Hamlet should have acted is not told us, but that it was his duty to have given up revenge is clearly suggested. We might, perhaps, sum up Hamlet's right course, from the hints Maeterlinck has given us, in a sentence. Had he relinquished all idea of revenge and forgiven his uncle and mother, he would have ennobled his soul, gained inward happiness, spread a gracious calm around and have so deeply influenced his wicked relations, that they would have become repentant and reformed. Thus his evil Destiny would have been averted and we should have had no tragedy of Hamlet. This explanation sounds rather conventional and tract-like put into ordinary language, but, indeed, Maeterlinck's doctrine might be compressed into a syllogism:-- All the wise are serene, Hamlet was not serene, Hamlet was not wise. That is the simple syllogism by which Maeterlinck tests human nature. But Hamlet's nature cannot be packed into a syllogism. A Theorist, who tries to fit into his theory a peculiar nature cannot always afford to understand that nature. The external event that froze Hamlet's soul with horror, and deprived it of 'transforming power' was a supernatural event, not 'disease, accident, or sudden death!' The mandate laid on his soul was a supernatural mandate, and as Judge Webb said in a suggestive and interesting paper: 'The Genuine text of Shakespeare,' October number of the 'National Review, 903,' 'it was utterly impossible for that soul to perform it,' or it might be added, to cast it aside. He was betrayed by the apparition 'into consequences as deep as those into which Macbeth was betrayed by the instruments of darkness--the witches.' We cannot reason about Maeterlinck's thought that if expressed 'would have arrested all the forces of murder' because we do not know what the thought was, nor can any one gauge or estimate rightly the power of Hamlet's soul to conquer external events, without taking into careful account that the Vision from another world came to Hamlet, when he was outraged at the re-marriage of his mother and full of emotion that the sudden death of his father called forth in his meditative mind. But Maeterlinck never refers to anything of this sort. He does not seem to realise what the effects of the vision must have been on a complicated character--on 'a great gentleman in whom the courtier's, scholar's eye, tongue, sword, were all united.' Hamlet was not an example of the normal type of the irresolute man--but the mandate laid upon his nature, it could not perform. The vision was his destiny--for Destiny lay in the nature of the mandate, as well as the nature of the man, and unhappiness was inevitable; yet Maeterlinck says, 'No tragedy is inevitable, the wise man can be superior to all circumstances by the initiative of the soul. To be able to curb the blind force of instinct is to be able to curb external destiny.' Did not Hamlet curb his instincts of love for Ophelia, and love for books and philosophy, under pressure of the great commandment laid upon him? He could not curb the power of his intellect--it was too subtle and supreme, but he concealed all else. Yet Hamlet could not escape his Destiny, by curbing his instincts. The initiative of his soul worked against the duty he had to perform. And it was through his 'simple, tender, good,' thoughts of, and love for his father that he kept to his task, and could not 'withstand his complicated destiny.' Maeterlinck is surely wrong, too, in saying Hamlet was moved by a fanatical impulse to revenge for he spent his life in weighing pros, and cons, and in combating the idea that he must fulfil the duty laid upon him. So unfanatical was he that he even doubted at times whether the apparition was his father's spirit. But supposing there had been 'one brave soul to cry out the truth' (Maeterlinck does not say what the truth was); we will suppose that Hamlet had resolved to forgive fully and generously, would he, then, have gained the fortitude and serenity, which Maeterlinck evidently means by inner happiness? Not if he kept a shred of his inner nature. Hamlet 'saw no course clear enough to satisfy his understanding.' Could such a nature be serene? But was it unwise? Judicious, wise, and witty when at ease; he could not escape the dark moods that made him indifferent to the visible world. 'If OEdipus had had the inner refuge of a Marcus Aurelius, what could Destiny have done to him?' asks Maeterlinck. Fate we suppose would have had no power over him, if he had calmly reasoned over the terrible circumstances in which he found himself involved, and if he preserved his equanimity to the end, as M. Aurelius would have done. Does this prove more than that the two men may have had very different temperaments? But, individuality cannot be made to agree with theory, and can be tabulated in no science book of humanity. When Maeterlinck says, 'Hamlet's ignorance puts the seal on his unhappiness,' we may well ask ignorance of what? Was it ignorance of the power of will? Certainly his intellect was greater than his will. 'He would have been greater had he been less great.' The 'concentration of all the interests that belong to humanity' was in Hamlet. Except the gifts of serenity and calmness, what did he lack? And because he was not inwardly serene, Maeterlinck considers him blind and ignorant. It is strange to connect blindness and ignorance with a wit of intellectual keenness, an imagination of a poet, and the unflinching questioning of the philosopher. Maeterlinck says: 'Hamlet thinks much but is by no means wise.' How does Hamlet show he had not the wisdom of life? Maeterlinck, no doubt, would dwell on his varying moods, his subtle melancholy, his nature baffled by a supernatural command. If he was not wise how strange he should have said so many words of truest wisdom both of Life and Death, 'If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come; the readiness is all.' We feel that Hamlet was 'a being with springs of thought and feeling and action deeper than we can search.' But the elements in his nature could not resolve themselves into an inner life of calm. Therefore, according to Maeterlinck, he was not wise, for he could not conquer his inner fatality--destiny in himself. Maeterlinck's ideas are very beautiful, and he writes delightfully, but his test of wisdom is questionable, for Hamlet's thoughts have captured and invaded and influenced the best minds and experiences of thinkers for centuries, How many a Shakespearean reader has felt that Hamlet is one of the very wisest of men as well as one of the most lovable and attractive! Not his ignorance, but his wisdom has borne the test of study and time. He did not bear the tragedy of life when the supernatural entered it, with an unshaken soul, but ourselves and the realities of life become clearer to us, the more we read his thoughts. If 'it is we who are Hamlet,' as Hazlitt said, it is a great tribute to his universality--but a greater one to ourselves. Indeed, we learn wisdom, not only from the lucubrations of the serene and calm, or from Hamlet, magnificent in thought, acute and playful, but also from Hamlet in his mortal struggles, in his deep questionings, and his melancholy. For wisdom 'dwells not in the light alone But in the darkness and the cloud.' IV. AN. Philosophers talk of a philosophy of art, ancient and modern. But this is unnecessary. Art is always art, or never art, as the case may be; whether it is art in the days of Pheidias and Praxitiles, of Rafael, or of Turner, or whether it is not art as in the days of its degeneration in Greece and Italy. The outward expression of course, changes, but it changes through individual and national aptitudes, not from Chronology. That indispensable and indescribable thing which is of the essence of art, is the same in all times and countries; for art is ever young, there is no old, no new, and here is its essential difference from science. In its essence, art is neither ancient or modern, because it is incapable of progress, it is the expression of an illimitable idea. We find before the Christian Era more beautiful sculpture than after it. 'Ah!' Victor Hugo says in his 'William Shakespeare,' 'You call yourself Dante, well! But that one calls himself Homer. The beauty of art consists in not being susceptible of improvement. A chef d'oeuvre exists once and for ever. The first Poet who arrives, arrives at the summit. From Pheidias to Rembrandt there is no onward movement.""","""Destiny and human nature in Hamlet""","2220","""In Shakespeare's iconic tragedy """"Hamlet,"""" the concept of destiny and its interplay with human nature is a central theme that weaves throughout the fabric of the play. The characters grapple with their fates, making choices that ultimately shape their destinies. Through the complex interactions of characters such as Hamlet, Claudius, Ophelia, and Gertrude, Shakespeare explores the intricate dance between destiny and human agency, challenging the audience to ponder the role of fate in the unfolding tragedy.  At the heart of """"Hamlet"""" lies the titular character's struggle with his own destiny. Hamlet is a man torn between his desire for revenge and his contemplative nature, grappling with the weight of the decisions he must make. His famous soliloquy, """"To be or not to be,"""" encapsulates his existential dilemma as he questions the nature of fate and free will. Hamlet's indecisiveness manifests as he navigates the treacherous waters of his fate, illustrating the complexities of human nature in the face of destiny.  In contrast to Hamlet's introspection, Claudius embodies the darker side of human nature in the play. His ambition drives him to commit regicide and seize power, setting off a chain of events that leads to his downfall. Claudius's actions reflect a willful defiance of destiny, as he seeks to manipulate his circumstances to achieve his goals. However, his Machiavellian schemes ultimately lead to his tragic demise, underscoring the futility of attempting to escape one's fate through deceit and treachery.  Ophelia, on the other hand, represents the fragility of human nature in the face of destiny. Her descent into madness following the death of her father, Polonius, highlights the destructive impact of external forces on an individual's psyche. Ophelia's tragic end serves as a poignant reminder of the vulnerability of human nature when confronted with the inexorable march of fate. Her fate is sealed by the actions of others, revealing the interconnectedness of destinies in the tapestry of human experience.  Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, embodies a more nuanced portrait of human nature in relation to destiny. Her hasty marriage to Claudius after King Hamlet's death raises questions about her agency in shaping her own destiny. Gertrude's loyalty and affection for Claudius, despite the moral implications, highlight the complexities of human emotions and their role in determining one's path in life. Her character serves as a foil to Hamlet, underscoring the different ways in which individuals respond to the challenges posed by fate.  Through the intertwining narratives of these characters, Shakespeare probes the depths of human nature and its relationship to destiny. The play raises fundamental questions about the nature of choice, agency, and the extent to which individuals can shape their own destinies. While """"Hamlet"""" offers no easy answers, it invites audiences to ponder the intricacies of human behavior and the forces that shape our lives.  Ultimately, """"Hamlet"""" serves as a timeless exploration of the interplay between destiny and human nature, inviting us to reflect on our own struggles with fate and free will. As we follow the tragic journey of its characters, we are reminded of the universal truths embedded in Shakespeare's masterful storytelling: that destiny is a tapestry woven from the threads of our choices, and that our humanity lies in how we navigate the twists and turns of our fates.""","693"
"Jaggar Thomas Augustus","""More grief developed on our way up to Waimea when we fractured wooden rear axle attachments. We went gratefully into the Parker Ranch shop for some days, until we were able to return to Hilo and the volcano, completing the circuit of the island. The National Geographic vessel was built by George Powell who advertised a Ford mobileboat, designed for the use of fishermen to enter midcontinent lakes. He had started on a larger model, which Grosvenor accepted for the National Geographic Expedition. Powell and I tried it out on Bellingham roads and lakes and on beaches of Puget Sound. We provided everything extra, for Alaska had no roadside filling stations. A wheeled vehicle on the peninsula was unheard of. We had elongate steel mats to give traction across the upper sands of a beach, and this plus bow winch, levers, and manpower enabled us to abandon beaches and enter the tundra. Our planning paid off, for in the 00 miles along the coast of Alaska from Shumagin Islands to King Cove, over water, beaches, and tundra, we did not even have to pump up the tires. The Honukais numerous excessively low gears even enabled us to drive to the snowline and bring out the heavy fur and bones of a bear that I had shot on a snowy volcano, Mount Dana. The expedition was very productive. McKinley made an excellent topographic map; we corrected errors in old maps; we obtained many photographs through Richard Stewart, who carried still, color, and movie cameras; and we obtained minerals, fossils, geologic notes, and many plants which I collected. McKinley used a panorama camera for his topographic work and his wide photographs were invaluable as a record of the country. Meanwhile, I kept in tough with the seismograph station at Kodiak. The steamers of the Pacific Commercial Company, which owned several of the canneries and had headquarters in Bellingham, transported us from Puget Sound to King Cove, and the many tugs for the canneries salmon traps enabled me to make local explorations along the southern coast. At one trap the fishermen had a tame baby seal, who would eat nothing but little trout caught for him from the brook. He lived in a box, and went off to sea by himself at night; but he always came home next morning. In 929 Finch sent Austin Jones, a seismologist, to construct and establish a hut at the Dutch Harbor radio station for a second Alaskan seismograph, of the Hawaiian type designed by R. M. Wilson. Jones taught the wife of a radio operator to manipulate the station and transmit the seismograms. The women in charge of the two stations at Kodiak and Dutch Harbor kept their work up for several years, and kept in constant correspondence with me. Though in the winter time they had to dig the stations out of snowdrifts, and to cope with all kinds of damage from rain and storm, they courageously and faithfully visited the instruments. It is a hellish country for weather. Although both stations were within fifty miles of active volcanoes, earthquakes were not numerous, and the story was very different from that told by our records made at the edge of Kilauea caldera, only two miles from an active lava center. Thus we have demonstrated that the only way to study an active volcano is to live close to the crater itself, even if a shelter has to be built underground. In concluding this story of our Alaskan expeditions of the twenties, in contrast to my windjamming experience of 907, I must underscore the importance of water transportation and credit those who have provided it. In fact, all transportation was by water until aircraft became supplemental. I feel that the U.S. Coast Guard, which takes care of the Pribilof Island seals, is the supreme achievement of our government in policing these stormy waters. Their 0-foot motor cruiser, equipped with sails has come to be standard for such government bureaus as the Biological Survey and has replaced the earlier, 0-foot sealing schooner among the traders. The canneries maintain big boatbuilding yards and operate large and powerful tugs for visiting the salmon traps. The traps are heavy weirs made of northwest pine logs, which are battered to pieces by the winter storms and must be rebuilt with pile drivers every spring. Thus a by product of cannery activities, and a godsend for trappers, fishermen, Aleuts, and campers is the pine lumber distributed all along the beaches from the annual wreckage of salmon traps. It is the only firewood and construction material of the country to be found anywhere west of Kodiak, for the land has no forests. Our contribution to the boating problem was the exhibition of what an amphibian landing truck will do on Alaskan beaches and its usefulness along those beaches where a boat may be in difficulties from stormy weather. I returned to my Hawaii headquarters in the fall of 928. The year 929 was marked by an earthquake crisis which began in mid-September with an unusual number of shocks in the vicinity of Hualalai Volcano, a place hitherto notably free from earthquakes. This was of interest because events on Mauna Loa had shown higher and higher lava sources and quake centers for the south rift. The 926 outflow had begun by splitting northward across the summit crater, and there making a considerable flow eastward toward Wood Valley while Wingate and his topographic party were in camp close to the summit. Therefore, when the 929 quakes began near Puuwaawaa, it looked as though Mauna Loa eruptions might begin again at the northwest. A very strong quake of September 5/8 was felt all over the island, and in our seismograph cellar was a peculiar swaying movement that set all the instruments jiggling, dismantled recording pens, and produced a queer feeling that the building was floating like a boat in a whirlpool. Immediately came word that North Kona had suffered heavily, particularly at Puuwaawaa Ranch near the cone of that name, where the 85/89 Mauna Loa flow had swept past. I motored at once with Mrs. Jaggar to Puuwaawaa, where we were hospitably entertained by the family of Mrs. Robert Hind. The damage all about was fantastic, with houses pulled apart, stone walls flung down in a seaward direction, redwood water tanks wrecked, and shops on the lower side of the highway moved toward the sea leaving a chasm between them and the road. Resting in our bedroom, we could hear the window frames ticking like clocks for long periods of time, then coming to a sudden wrench which felt as though a lifting wave had passed through the mountain under us. I returned to the Observatory to get a shock recorder for use at the ranch porch to count these strong motion shocks. Meanwhile residents in Kona jotted down times of the shocks, which were coming by hundreds. On October at about P.M., as I was returning through North Kona in my car, I noticed a little unexplained excitement among people by the roadside. I stopped at the residence of Frank Greenwell, whose wife was a faithful counter of quakes, to find Mrs. Greenwell and her daughter on the veranda in tears. They had just been through fearful earthquakes, which in a moving car I had not felt. Flower vases were overturned, furniture was disarranged, dishes were flung off the dining room table, and kitchen utensils and milk were in a jumble. It was hard to believe that anything so terrific could have happened without my feeling it. I found even more dire catastrophe at Puuwaawaa. The stone chimney was overturned, breakage of china and of glass in the preserve closet in the basement was severe, a stone bench was flung down and broken on the lawn, and one side of the cellar was caved in. We took to living in automobiles, for there had been land slips on the mountain. This earthquake had been worse than that of September 5/8. Even hillside cottages were split apart. I set up the shock recorder, which registered about,00 earthquakes during the next three months, until mid-December. The intensity and frequency of these quakes declined, as is usual with aftershocks of a big earthquake, recalling 868 and the south end of the island. At that time both Mauna Loa and Kilauea had had rift outflows, and as the seismographic center of the new earthquakes was close to the 800 and 85/89 flows from Hualalai and Mauna Loa, everybody expected a lava flow; but none came. Armine von Tempski who was a visitor during this period was inspired to write Lava. She added a Hualalai lava flow using material that I gave her to describe it. Her description is magnificent although she, herself, had never seen a lava flow. The October shock was bad on the west flank of Mauna Kea, where water tanks were overturned and the high wireless station was damaged, and at Kamuela, where plumbing pipes were fractured. Parker Ranch was damaged, and the constant racking along the entire length of the Kona settlements caused land slips and broken masonry in many places, always damaging north-south stone fences more than those at right angles to the seashore. This three months of northwest earthquakes, a condition unknown since 801, the year when Hualalai lava flowed into the sea, indicated that lava was coming north of Mauna Loa. This had not happened since 899, for the flows on the southwest rift, always beginning near the summit crater, had been during 903, 907, 914, 916, 919, and 926. Belief was that the southwestern rift of the mountain was filling progressively higher with solidified redhot cement, not brittle enough to fracture open easily, whereas the northern rifts--such as the sources of 85/89, 881, and 899--were now hard and brittle and ready for fracture. The fracturing took the form of northwest cracking and this was lava wedging, confirmed by the summit and northern outflows which were to come in 933 and 935/8. July of 929 produced a new influx of lava into Halemaumau, nineteen degrees north of the equator.""","""Alaskan expeditions and geological observations""","2135","""Alaska, the northernmost and largest state in the United States, is a land of unparalleled beauty and wilderness. It is a destination that has long captivated the imagination of adventurers, scientists, and nature enthusiasts alike. The rugged terrain, remote wilderness, and extreme weather conditions make Alaska a challenging yet rewarding location for expeditions and geological observations.  Alaskan expeditions offer a unique opportunity to explore some of the most pristine and untouched landscapes on Earth. From towering mountains to sweeping glaciers, dense forests to vast tundras, Alaska's diverse ecosystems provide a rich tapestry for exploration. Whether by foot, boat, plane, or dog sled, adventurers can immerse themselves in the raw beauty and untamed wilderness of this extraordinary land.  One of the most iconic features of Alaska is its majestic mountain ranges, including the Alaska Range, the Brooks Range, and the Coast Mountains. These rugged peaks offer a formidable challenge to climbers and hikers, with their steep slopes, glaciers, and unpredictable weather. Mount McKinley, also known as Denali, is the highest peak in North America and a coveted summit for mountaineers from around the world. The sheer scale and grandeur of these mountains make them a focal point for many Alaskan expeditions.  In addition to its mountains, Alaska is also home to a vast network of glaciers that shape the landscape and provide valuable insights into Earth's geological history. Glaciers such as the Mendenhall Glacier, Hubbard Glacier, and Columbia Glacier are a prominent feature of Alaska's geography, offering a glimpse into the dynamic processes of ice formation and movement. These icy behemoths are not only awe-inspiring to behold but also serve as indicators of climate change, with their retreat and advance patterns reflecting shifts in global temperature.  The geological diversity of Alaska extends beyond its mountains and glaciers to include volcanic landscapes, coastal fjords, and tectonic plate boundaries. The Aleutian Islands, a volcanic archipelago that stretches across the Pacific Ring of Fire, are a hotspot for geological activity, with numerous active and dormant volcanoes dotting the island chain. The presence of such geological phenomena provides scientists and researchers with a natural laboratory to study volcanic processes, seismic activity, and plate tectonics.  Alaska's coastline is another crucial area for geological observation, with its fjords, bays, and estuaries offering insights into coastal erosion, sediment deposition, and marine ecosystems. The fjords of Kenai Fjords National Park, for example, showcase the powerful forces of glaciation and the shaping of coastal features over millennia. Studying these coastal environments can help researchers understand the intricate interactions between land, sea, and climate in a changing world.  Moreover, Alaska lies at the boundary of the North American and Pacific tectonic plates, leading to seismic activity and frequent earthquakes. The Denali Fault, a major strike-slip fault system that traverses the state, is a testament to the ongoing tectonic forces at work beneath the surface. By monitoring and studying seismic activity in Alaska, scientists can gain valuable insights into plate movements, earthquake dynamics, and the geophysical processes that shape our planet.  In the realm of paleontology, Alaska is a treasure trove of ancient fossils and remnants of prehistoric life. The state's unique geological history, which includes periods of submergence and uplift, has preserved a wealth of fossils dating back millions of years. The famous Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska, for instance, is renowned for its rich deposits of fossilized plants, insects, and even dinosaur footprints, providing a window into the ancient ecosystems that once thrived in this region.  Alaskan expeditions and geological observations are not without challenges, however. The state's remote and harsh environment presents logistical hurdles, including limited access, inclement weather, and rugged terrain. Expedition teams must be well-prepared, self-sufficient, and knowledgeable about wilderness survival techniques to navigate Alaska's unforgiving landscapes safely.  Furthermore, climate change poses a significant threat to Alaska's delicate ecosystems and geological processes. Warming temperatures, melting glaciers, permafrost thaw, and sea-level rise are all impacting the state's environment, requiring scientists to closely monitor and study these changes to understand their implications for the future.  Despite these challenges, Alaska remains a beacon for exploration and discovery, drawing researchers, adventurers, and nature lovers to its untamed wilderness. The opportunity to witness firsthand the forces of nature at work, from glaciation to volcanism, and to unravel the mysteries of Earth's geological past makes Alaska a truly remarkable destination for expeditions and geological observations.  In conclusion, Alaska's vast and varied landscapes offer a wealth of opportunities for exploration and scientific inquiry. From its towering mountains and glaciers to its volcanic terrains and coastal fjords, Alaska provides a captivating backdrop for expeditions and geological observations. By delving into the state's geological wonders, researchers can unravel the complex tapestry of Earth's history and gain insights into the dynamic processes that have shaped and continue to shape our planet. Alaska stands as a testament to the enduring power of nature and a testament to the spirit of exploration that drives us to seek out the unknown.""","1037"
"Russell William F  William Fletcher ","""The Constitution guards the humblest person against abuse of the power granted to the government, as well as against the wrongs of our neighbors. The people in this country have great power--absolute power. This power may be expressed in laws enacted by Congress or by the legislatures of the States, except in those things which the people themselves in the Constitution of the United States, and in the Constitutions of the different States, have placed beyond even their own power. Of course these provisions of the Constitution, as all provisions of the Constitution, may be changed by the people, but not by a mere majority of the people. These constitutional provisions relate to sacred rights, and they may not be changed except upon mature deliberation, and by a vote which represents the sentiment of at least a majority of the people of three-fourths of the States. So I hope you can realize that when the framers of the Constitution prohibited bills of attainder, and prohibited the enactment of the ex post facto laws, they were doing something for the people of this country. They had the rights of the people in mind--the rights of the humble and perhaps unknown, as well as the rights of those in high places. I do not expect you to study the details of these provisions of the Constitution relating to bills of attainder and ex post facto laws. You will probably never have to enforce these rights which are given to you under the Constitution. I hope you will not; but the important thing which I always want you to bear in mind is, that these guaranties of the Constitution are in existence and that they confer upon you certain powers which may be asserted to protect your liberty if occasion should ever arise. I am sure you realize that at the beginning of the life of the American Nation, extreme care was exercised by those who framed the Constitution, to guard the people at every point against injustice and wrong, whether exercised by private individuals or by public officials. Understanding these things--feeling these things, will give you a new sense of power, of pride, and of duty, as citizens of this great Nation.. What does attainder mean?. What was the effect of a bill of attainder on the family of a man who was convicted?. Why does the abolition of attainder show the charity of the founders of the Constitution?. What is an ex post facto law?. How would this kind of a law be unjust?. How could a strong, powerful, and dishonest man work injustice by means of such a law? A. Show how attainder worked in England in the early days. B. What were the abuses found under such a law? C. Show how its abolition made for democracy. D. Show how the abolition of ex post facto laws made for democracy. E. Write a paper on the following: The Injustice of Attainder The Injustice of an Ex Post Facto Law XXI.,, Prohibition Of Titles And Foreign Gifts--Treason, Its Trial And Punishment America is a democracy. It was the plan from the beginning that it always should be a democracy. The human race had suffered much from royalty, from kings and emperors, and queens and princes. Human nature is weak. We are all more or less attracted by people with titles. Story books which we read in childhood exalt the 'lords' and 'ladies' and 'princes', and I regret to say that the history of lords and ladies and princes does not always justify the pictures which our story books would paint for us. The men who framed the Constitution had just finished a life and death struggle with royalty--a struggle between the people and a king, and the people had won. They were determined that the blighting influence of royal power should never again find a place on American soil. Therefore they put into the Constitution: 'No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.'(8) Never before in the history of the world was such a bold thing done. These words reflect the spirit of the Revolution. They mark the turning point in the history of human governments. They proclaim the final establishment of the government by the people--the first real government by the people that the world ever knew. I wonder if those who criticise the government of America who complain that in this country the people have no chance, ever read these glowing words of our Constitution. It isn't so much the words, but the spirit in which they were made a part of our Constitution, the spirit in which the young Nation proclaimed to the world eternal separation from kingly power. I find all through the Constitution an expression of grim determination to fortify the Nation against any influence which would weaken the supreme power of the people, which would in any way interfere with the plan to make this a government by the people. In many provisions of our Constitution we find expressions which show how humane America is. We hate treason. In fact there is no crime so dark, so awful, as treason. But in the history of the world, treason has meant many things, and unfortunately treason has been made not only the instrument of those who sought the destruction of the governments, but it has sometimes been made the instrument of tyrants in suppressing the rights, and in crushing the hopes of the people. It all depends on what is meant by treason. In the olden days we find men charged with treason when the offense was in fact very slight--perhaps a just resistance to the king, perhaps merely an assertion of natural human right against the king. The government of the United States being intended to protect the liberties of the people, the Constitution put a bar against prosecution for treason, except where the accused was actually an enemy of his country, endeavoring to aid in the destruction of his country. We are here told what treason is: 'Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. 'The Congress shall have power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person Attainted.'(9) We see all through the Constitution a splendid spirit of justice, and a spirit of charity, even toward the guilty. By this article of the Constitution, not only is treason defined, but any conviction of a person for treason must be upon the testimony of at least two witnesses to the same act, or upon a confession in open court. The innocent must not be punished; and the guilty, when convicted, shall alone bear the punishment. Treason being such a grave offense, Congress may, if it so desires, provide very severe penalties, but it cannot attaint the blood, so that the children or the grandchildren of the guilty person shall suffer as in the olden days; nor shall the right of forfeiture of property obtain, except during the life of the person guilty of treason. No one objects to any penalty, however severe, where treason is proved, but it is contrary to the spirit of America to brand the innocent descendants of one who is guilty of a crime. Of course the children of the guilty will always bear a certain degree of reproach from their fellowmen, but it is not fair that they should be visited with penalties for an offense which they themselves never committed. It is the spirit of America that each person shall enjoy any position in life which he may win by merit and honest endeavor, and no obstacle should be placed in his way by the wrong of an unfortunate ancestor.. America is a democracy. Why does this mean so much?. What does that phrase bring to mind?. Why did we abolish all titles of nobility?. What is treason?. Why is it limited so carefully? A. What was the real purpose of abolishing all titles of nobility? B. Why did the founders of the Constitution refuse to permit our representatives to accept gifts from abroad? C. What acts are treason to-day? D. Show how these provisions make for democracy? E. Write a paper on the following: An Illustration of an Act of Treason During the World War How A Person May Obtain a Responsible Position in Life Laws Which Retard Advancement in Life XXII. JURY, IN Criminal Trials, Except Impeachment, To Be By Jury--Equal Rights--No Religious Test For Office There are still three articles of the Constitution containing personal guaranties but the substance of these articles has been considered in connection with other articles already discussed. They are the following: 'The trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury, and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.'(0) 'The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.'(1) 'No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.'(2) Here again we see emphasized the right of trial by jury. I want you to give some thought to this particular right, because it applies not only to cases where persons are accused of a crime, but also to nearly all cases involving property rights.""","""Constitutional rights and protections""","1972","""Constitutional rights and protections are the cornerstone of democracy and individual freedoms in many countries. These rights are enshrined in a nation's constitution, serving as a shield against governmental overreach and a guarantee of essential liberties for its citizens.  One fundamental aspect of constitutional rights is the protection of individual freedoms. These rights ensure that individuals have the autonomy to express themselves, practice their religion, assemble peacefully, and petition the government for redress of grievances. Freedom of speech, for example, allows individuals to voice their opinions without fear of censorship or retaliation. Similarly, freedom of religion protects the right to worship according to one's beliefs without interference.  Another crucial element of constitutional rights is the protection against unreasonable government intrusion into personal lives. The Fourth Amendment, for instance, guards against unwarranted searches and seizures by requiring law enforcement to obtain warrants based on probable cause. This provision ensures that individuals are safeguarded from arbitrary invasions of privacy by the state.  Moreover, constitutional rights extend to the realm of criminal justice, ensuring fair treatment for all individuals. The right to a fair trial, as outlined in the Sixth Amendment, guarantees that individuals accused of crimes have the opportunity to present their case before an impartial jury. Additionally, the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment prevents excessive or degrading treatment of individuals in the criminal justice system.  Furthermore, constitutional rights play a critical role in safeguarding marginalized and minority groups from discrimination and oppression. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment mandates that all individuals are entitled to equal treatment under the law, irrespective of race, gender, or other demographic characteristics. This provision has been instrumental in advancing civil rights and promoting social equality.  In addition to protecting individual rights, constitutional provisions also establish the framework for the separation of powers and the checks and balances that prevent any single branch of government from becoming too powerful. This division of powers ensures that each branch – the legislative, executive, and judicial – operates within its designated limits, serving as a safeguard against authoritarianism.  While constitutional rights provide essential protections, they are not absolute and may be subject to limitations in certain circumstances. The concept of balancing rights with responsibilities is crucial in maintaining a harmonious society where individuals' freedoms are respected while ensuring the common good and public welfare.  In conclusion, constitutional rights and protections form the bedrock of a free and democratic society, upholding the principles of justice, equality, and liberty for all. These rights serve as a bulwark against tyranny and injustice, empowering individuals to assert their rights and hold the government accountable. By cherishing and upholding constitutional rights, societies can strive towards a more just and equitable future for all.""","531"
"Cust Anna Maria Elizabeth","""Little Ireland in early days was a centre of artistic diffusion, almost more important for the Northern nations than that of Constantinople. Owing to freedom from invasion, Christianity and civilization had continued to flourish and the remnant of the old Latin literature was carefully preserved. Not long after the death of St. Patrick, the Irish Church, having increased in strength and learning, sent forth the famous St. Columba to minister to the hordes of barbarians who were over-running Britain. St. Columba met with great success and founded several large monasteries which became powerful centres of religion and learning in Scotland and England. For hundreds of years the schools of Ireland continued in great repute, numerous bands of missionaries were sent across the sea to convert the Germanic tribes on the continent. Most famous among these was St. Columbanus, who laboured in the East of France for many years, and afterwards in Switzerland and Italy, dying in 15/8 at the monastery he had founded at Bobbio. Everywhere these monks went they took with them the seeds of art and learning, beautiful illuminated manuscripts and other small works of art, which formed an inexhaustible store of motifs for the sculptors and goldsmiths of the following centuries. One of the disciples of Columbanus, St. Gall, who was called the Apostle of Switzerland, founded there the great monastery named after him, which became a most flourishing art centre in later years. The Anglo-Saxons were not idle, and in the eighth century St. Boniface and many others pierced far into the wild forests of Germany, founding the great monastic establishments which exist to this day. This was not a fleeting movement, but a close relation was kept up between England and the continent till well into the eleventh century. III. THE. Charlemagne, crowned emperor in 00, if not perhaps the wondrous hero of tradition, was a very powerful factor in the history and civilization of his day, and exerted all his energy to introduce order and learning among the vast hordes of barbarians who more or less willingly acknowledged his rule. He stirred up all latent powers, introduced new ideas and stimulated an admiration for all Roman culture, being dazzled quite as much by the actual pomp and splendour of the Constantinopolitan court as by the memories of ancient Rome. He invited learned men from the East and the West, but the most famous were Alcuin, who was born at York, and his pupil, Eginhardt, who became Secretary and Chronicler to Charlemagne and his successor. The Carlovingian renaissance was a most composite production. Byzantine Art had long been known to the Northern races, and at this time its influence was spread still further by the presence of artists exiled by the iconoclasts; but the Anglo-Saxon influence was even stronger, encouraged as it was by the bands of missionaries, and by Alcuin and his followers. To these intermingled strains must be added the independent Gallo-Roman reminiscence, the study of the monuments, and also a strange, but undeniable Oriental tendency, arising from communications with the East and the Moors in Spain. This renaissance, though to a certain extent artificial, lasted for nearly three centuries and affected the civilization of the whole of Western Europe. Carlovingian art flourished for centuries in Germany, but the invasions of the Normans checked for a while the artistic progress of Northern France. What little art they had was in much the same Norse style, but freshly barbaric and not like that of the British Isles, which had undergone centuries of incubation and had the additional Latin element. It was to this Anglo-Saxon Art, conventional as it had become, the human form often being reduced to a geometrical figure, that the Carlovingian craftsmen turned for inspiration. Two classes of ivory carving arose, one copied almost directly from the miniatures in the Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, which were themselves derived from late Roman types; and the second following more closely in the steps of the Byzantines. All through the Carlovingian period there is a close connection between the illuminator and the ivory carver, the latter trying to treat his subjects more in the manner of a painter, enlarged the cycle of Christian representations and began to break with tradition and recover his liberty. The figures still, in many cases, retain the heavy and rather crushed forms of degenerate Roman art; and in the endeavour to impart deeper expression the proportions were often spoiled, delicate parts, as the features being delineated in undue size, and the research for originality often leading to violent and exaggerated attitudes, and to the overloading of detail, yet all the gestures are instinct with life, and full of a naive directness of action. A small plaque in the museum at a good illustration of the immense influence of the miniatures on ivory carving. The Book of Psalms was especially popular, and this plaque is a word for word translation of certain verses of the XXVIIth plastic form. v.. When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. (The crowd of warriors, some of whom have fallen). v.. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle he shall hide me: he shall set me up upon a rock. (David is seen being welcomed into the Tabernacle, which stands on a rock). Part of v.. Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of an almost identical illustration of this psalm, which proves that this plaque was copied from it or some analogous manuscript, as the Bodley the British Museum. These Psalters have furnished a model for another of these scenic psalms, carved on a plaque set in the magnificent binding of the Psalter of Charles the Bald, in the Bibliotheque nationale at Paris. The manuscript was written between the years 42-69, and there is no reason to think that the jewelled and ivory cover is not contemporary. One side gives a graphic picture of the LVIth Psalm, and the other represents Nathan telling David the story of the little ewe lamb ( Sam. xii.). The Louvre possesses a plaque, also of the ninth century, representing the interview of Abner and Joab ( Sam. ii.), a subject by no means of general interest, and unlikely to have a plastic type, which proves still further the custom of copying the miniatures with more or less servility. One more scenic plaque in the Louvre is of interest, not so much in connection with the MSS., but from the strong resemblance to the Probianus diptych (Fig. ), especially in the lower scene, where the figures raise their hands to Solomon on his judgment seat. On the second half David is dictating his psalms to an assembly of clerks. It is difficult to class the ivories of this long period, but the majority are of German origin. Art and culture were a great deal dependent on the Court, which had the effect of bringing into line the work of craftsmen of very varying nationalities. Here also was a fear lest the people should worship the images themselves, but an iconoclastic spirit never arose, and these numerous carvings, besides adding to the sumptuousness of the cult, were used for the instruction of the unlettered. Ivory was classed with the precious metals, and much sought after for ecclesiastical purposes, the great abbeys of eastern France and Germany became regular workshops, making a large number of exquisite objects in goldsmiths work and ivory. We are given a little side-light on the use of ivory in a letter of Eginhardt to his son, in which he mentions that he is sending him a carved ivory model of classical architecture that he should better understand certain passages in Vitruvius. The mention of the work done in the monasteries brings us to the Abbey of St. Gall and the monk Tuotilo, who has long been the hero of the craft; but, alas, the charming picture that the chronicler Ekkehardt gives, a hundred years later, of this Leonardo among craftsmen is utterly without foundation; that there was a monk Tuotilo at the end of the ninth and the beginning of the tenth centuries the records of the monastery tell us, and a note added by a later hand says that he was learned and a sculptor. Ekkehardt spoils his argument in favour of Tuotilo by attributing to him too many perfections, and by finally quoting the opinion of Charlemagne, who had been dead and buried nearly a hundred years. It is very sad to have to give up the one real individual who greets us on the rather weary path of anonymity. The fine book cover, one leaf of which Ekkehardt attributes to Tuotilo , is still safely preserved in the Abbey of St. Gall, but the two leaves appear to be by the same hand, though there is every reason to attribute the workmanship to the ninth century. On the upper leaf Christ is represented in glory, youthful and beardless in type, as is often the case in Carlovingian ivories which come from the Germanic part of the empire.""","""Irish Monasticism and Artistic Influence""","1900","""Irish monasticism holds a unique place in the history of Christian spirituality and artistic expression. Emerging in the early medieval period, Irish monastic communities played a critical role in preserving knowledge, advancing learning, and pushing the boundaries of artistic creation. The fusion of spirituality, creativity, and craftsmanship within these monasteries produced a distinctive artistic style that continues to captivate and inspire us today.  The roots of Irish monasticism can be traced back to the arrival of Christianity in Ireland in the 5th century. Monastic settlements, initially established by influential figures such as Saint Patrick and Saint Columba, served as centers of religious devotion, scholarly pursuit, and artistic innovation. These monastic communities, often situated in remote and rugged landscapes, cultivated a deep sense of spiritual connection with nature, which found expression in their artistic endeavors.  One of the most notable aspects of Irish monastic art is its intricate interlace patterns. These elaborate designs, characterized by intertwining lines and knots, adorned manuscripts, stone carvings, metalwork, and other artifacts produced by Irish monks. The Book of Kells, a renowned illuminated manuscript created in the 9th century, is a prime example of the intricate artistry and meticulous craftsmanship associated with Irish monastic scribes.  In addition to interlace patterns, Irish monastic art also featured motifs inspired by nature, such as animals, plants, and symbolic elements like the Celtic cross. This fusion of Christian symbolism with indigenous artistic traditions resulted in a rich visual language that reflected the spiritual beliefs and cultural heritage of the Irish people.  The distinctive style of Irish monastic art spread beyond the confines of monastic communities and influenced artistic production across Europe. Missionary monks from Ireland, known as the """"peregrini,"""" traveled to distant lands, bringing with them not only the teachings of Christianity but also the artistic techniques and motifs of their homeland. The Hiberno-Scottish style, as it came to be known, left a lasting impact on Insular art in areas such as Scotland, England, and even as far as mainland Europe.  Irish monasticism's artistic influence extended beyond the realm of visual art to include other forms of creative expression, such as music and poetry. The tradition of Gaelic hymnody, characterized by its haunting melodies and evocative lyrics, has its roots in the chants and prayers of Irish monks. Poets like Saint Columba and Saint Brigid composed verses that reflected their deep spirituality and reverence for the natural world, shaping the poetic tradition of Ireland for centuries to come.  The interconnectedness of spirituality and art within Irish monasticism created a holistic approach to creativity, where the act of making art was imbued with religious devotion and a sense of transcendence. The delicate work of illuminating manuscripts or crafting intricate metalwork was seen as a form of prayer, a way to glorify the divine through the mastery of a craft.  Despite the passage of centuries, the legacy of Irish monasticism continues to inspire contemporary artists and scholars seeking to reconnect with the spiritual and artistic traditions of the past. The enduring allure of Irish monastic art lies not only in its technical brilliance and aesthetic beauty but also in its profound spiritual depth and connection to the natural world.  In conclusion, Irish monasticism's artistic influence transcends mere aesthetics; it embodies a profound spiritual vision that speaks to the timeless quest for meaning and beauty. The intricate interlace patterns, symbolic motifs, and poetic hymns crafted by Irish monks reflect a harmonious fusion of faith, creativity, and nature that remains a source of inspiration and wonder for generations to come.""","723"
"Philip Alexander","""The culmination of the scientific fabric of which Galileo and Newton laid the foundations was reached when it was demonstrated that the whole physical universe must be regarded as composed of Energy, either kinetic and actually undergoing transmutation from one form to another, or potential and quiescent yet containing within itself the quantifiable capacity of transformation. The objective correlatives of the different classes of sensible experiences are found to be different forms which this Energy assumes--the kinetic energy of a mass in motion, the radiant energy of Light, the energy of Heat, the potential energy of chemical separation, etc.--all these have now at length been shown to be forms of one real thing capable under appropriate conditions of being transmuted into each other and of which not only the inter-transmutability but the equivalent values can be calculated and have been found by experiment to be fixed and definite. Thus the mechanical equivalent of heat is a fixed and definite quantity. The Energy of a body in motion can be measured and stated in terms of mass and velocity. The profound conception of Aristotle, under which Nature was regarded as a potent Energy containing within itself the capacity of generating the phenomenal World, has again been revived and realised--but with great additions. The theory in the hands of Science is now not only confirmed by incessant experiment, but the relation which it affirms between reality and phenomenon has been quantified. Moreover, the actual operations under which the potential generates the actual have, so to say, been laid bare to view; and lastly, the inter-transmutability of all forms of Energy and its real unity have been established. The doctrine has therefore received a confirmation of which Aristotle did not dream, and its explanation has at the same time received an illumination which his vague if profound adumbration could never afford. With this added support the true conception of human knowledge has received new strength. The theory is still, nevertheless, not to be grasped without a resolute effort of reflection. It involves an inversion of our everyday conceptions more radical than that which was demanded by the Copernican theory of astronomy, and we know that that theory--offered to and rejected by mankind before the beginning of the Christian era--had to wait through sixteen or seventeen hundred years before it secured an acceptance, at first grudging and even now not always adequate. The ordinary metaphysical student has hitherto rather resented the idea that in order to a true solution of the problem of Knowledge he must acquaint himself with the fundamental conceptions of physics. Yet so it is. It may perhaps be hoped that when the first strangeness of the new position has disappeared the conditions may be accepted with greater readiness. At any rate, a correct apprehension of our fundamental conceptions of the world of our external experience is indispensable. No theory can wholly dispense with such conceptions. It is therefore essential that, however elementary, they should be clear and not contradictory. Philosophy has always vaguely realised and exacted as much. The need is now imperative. Some years ago, in an essay on Schopenhauer, the author, Mr. Saunders, remarked, 'How the matter of which my arm is composed and that state of consciousness which I call my Will are conjoined is a mystery beyond the reach of Science, and the man who can solve it is the man for whom the world is waiting.' Well, if that be so, then the world need not wait any longer. The required explanation is offered to metaphysics by the scientific work of the physicians who built up and consolidated the modern doctrine of Energy. It is true that most of them have continued to postulate the reality of material bodies. For their purpose there was no real difficulty in doing so. What they required was a datum of configuration, a phenomenal basis upon which their calculations could proceed and in terms of which, as a point of origin, their statement of transmutations was made. The persistence of material bodies is a condition precedent to the phenomenal manifestations in which our Experience arises. Organic existence in every form and the world in which it arises presuppose the actuality of these. But dynamically they are merely the phenomenal result of certain permanent forces constantly in operation. To beings, if there be such, inhabiting the Ether there is little doubt but that a gravitation system like that of the sun and its planets must present a corporate rigidity and identity somewhat similar to that which cohering masses present to our intelligence. But, in terms of reality, Energy, potential and kinetic, containing within itself the potency which generates the actual and sustains the constant transmutation in which phenomena arise is the sole and only postulate. The rise of meta-geometrical methods and other branches of scientific speculation have led in recent years to a considerable amount of very interesting inquiry into the nature of our fundamental geometrical conceptions. Strange to say, a large body of respectable mathematicians have been found to favour the extraordinary view that our mathematical conceptions are derived from Sensation. We do not propose here to discuss at length this idea. It is merely another form of the old sensationalist view of Knowledge, but we suggest that the conditions of the problem will readily appear in their true light and real nature whenever such inquirers realise the fact that our exertional activity is the source of our cognitions of the external, and that therefore our pure exertional activity is the source of the basal concepts of geometry. Here lies the root of the distinction between pure and empirical science. The propositions of geometry, being derived from our own pure activity, are of the former class; the inductive conclusions of physical experimental science, being gathered by observation and measurement from sensible data, are empirical and approximate. A geometrical proposition--such, for example, as the assertion that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles--is not merely approximate. It has no dependence on measurement. It is absolutely true. It is ascertained deductively, and therefore measurement is not involved, and is never employed. Its truth is not ascertained by measurement. It is not verified by measurement. It in no degree depends upon the sensible figure. It is equally true for every human being whatever be the degree of accuracy of the figure by the aid of which he studies it, or indeed whether he studies it by figure or otherwise, as must necessarily be the case with the born blind. There may be many different forms of energetic transmutation which may determine many other forms of space besides that form of tridimensional space in which our Activity is involved. For such, a different geometry may and will be applicable; but for the tridimensional conditions of our activity the proposition is necessary and absolute. No measurement of any stellar parallax, however minute and whatever the result might be, could have any bearing on its truth. Geometry is the science of the pure forms of our motor activity amidst corporeal bodies. A useful illustration of our argument is to be drawn from a consideration of the question of phonetic spelling. Occasionally we find persons urging that all spelling should be an exact reproduction of sound. Indeed, an improved alphabet has been designed to enable the idea to be carried out with greater accuracy. Now it is quite true that it is by their sound that we recognise or denote our words. Hence our alphabet was originally phonetic in principle, and indeed still is so, although the correspondence is imperfect. As the use of visible signs develops spelling seems to fall into certain fixed frames and to deviate more and more from pure phonetic simplicity. But why is this so? It is because the sounds are merely the symbols or indicators of the different forms of vocal as far removed from a pure phonetic representation as the ordinary method of spelling. Indeed, unless some such suprasensible and unifying principle were available, phonetic spelling would speedily perish in an infinity of degenerate variations. We adduce this illustration as one which very well confirms our main argument.""","""Nature of Energy and Knowledge Integration""","1596","""Energy and knowledge integration exemplifies the beautiful interplay of scientific principles and cognitive processes to advance various fields of study. Understanding the nature of energy is crucial not only in the realm of physics but also in diverse disciplines like biology, chemistry, and environmental science. It serves as the bedrock for comprehending the workings of the universe at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Knowledge integration, on the other hand, involves synthesizing information from different sources and perspectives to create a richer understanding of complex phenomena.  Energy, as defined in science, is the ability to do work or produce heat. It exists in various forms, including kinetic energy (energy of motion), potential energy (stored energy), thermal energy (energy due to temperature), chemical energy (energy stored in chemical bonds), and many others. The conservation of energy principle, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but can only be transformed from one form to another, is fundamental in all energy-related phenomena. This principle underscores the interconnectedness of energy forms and the importance of energy transfer in natural processes.  In the context of knowledge integration, the synthesis of information from different domains or sources plays a pivotal role in advancing scientific understanding. It involves connecting disparate pieces of knowledge to form a coherent and comprehensive view of a subject. This multidisciplinary approach enables researchers and scholars to tackle complex problems that require insights from multiple disciplines. By integrating knowledge from various fields, scientists and experts can develop innovative solutions and address pressing challenges facing society.  The integration of energy concepts with different branches of knowledge leads to profound discoveries and advancements. In biology, for example, the study of biochemical pathways relies on understanding how energy is transferred within living organisms. The conversion of food into energy through cellular respiration, a process involving the breakdown of glucose to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), is a fundamental aspect of energy utilization in biological systems. Integrating knowledge of biochemistry, physiology, and physics helps elucidate the intricate mechanisms behind energy transfer and utilization in living organisms.  Moreover, in environmental science, the interplay between energy and ecosystems is a critical area of study. Ecosystems rely on energy inputs from the sun through photosynthesis to sustain life processes. The cycling of energy within ecosystems, from producers to consumers and decomposers, shapes the dynamics of ecological communities. By integrating knowledge of energy flows with ecological principles, researchers can assess the impacts of human activities on ecosystem functioning and develop strategies for sustainable resource management.  Chemistry, another field intimately connected with energy, explores the interactions between atoms and molecules that underlie chemical reactions. The concept of energy change in chemical reactions, characterized by the exchange of heat or work, is central to understanding reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. Integrating this knowledge with principles from physics and mathematics provides a holistic approach to predicting and interpreting chemical transformations.  Furthermore, the integration of energy and knowledge extends beyond the realm of natural sciences. In engineering, the design of energy-efficient systems and technologies relies on interdisciplinary insights from physics, materials science, and environmental studies. By integrating knowledge of energy sources, conversion processes, and utilization efficiency, engineers can develop sustainable solutions that minimize environmental impact and maximize resource utilization.  On a broader societal level, the integration of energy and knowledge is crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and energy security. By combining expertise from diverse fields such as renewable energy technology, policy analysis, and social sciences, researchers and policymakers can develop comprehensive strategies to transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future. This integration requires collaboration across disciplines and sectors to harness collective expertise and drive transformative change.  In conclusion, the nature of energy and knowledge integration epitomizes the synergy between scientific principles and cognitive processes. By integrating energy concepts with diverse fields of knowledge, researchers and experts can unravel the complexities of the natural world, develop innovative solutions, and address pressing societal challenges. This interconnected approach fosters creativity, collaboration, and interdisciplinary thinking, paving the way for advancements that benefit both current and future generations. Embracing the fusion of energy and knowledge is essential for unlocking new frontiers of discovery and promoting a sustainable future for our planet.""","821"
"Scott Walter","""The instant that Arnold Biederman appeared, and before the Landamman could open his lips to demand the meaning of what he saw, the priest drew back, the executioner stepped forward, the sword was brandished, the blow was struck, and the victim's head rolled on the scaffold. A general acclamation and clapping of hands, like that by which a crowded theatre approves of some well-graced performer, followed this feat of dexterity. While the headless corpse shot streams from the arteries, which were drunk up by the sawdust that strewed the scaffold, the executioner gracefully presented himself alternately at the four corners of the stage, modestly bowing, as the multitude greeted him with cheers of approbation. 'Nobles, knights, gentlemen of free-born blood, and good citizens,' he said, 'who have assisted at this act of high justice, I pray you to bear me witness that this judgment hath been executed after the form of the sentence, at one blow, and without stroke missed or repeated.' The acclamations were reiterated. 'Long live our Scharfgerichter Steinernherz, and many a tyrant may he do his duty on!' 'Noble friends,' said the executioner, with the deepest obeisance, 'I have yet another word to say, and it must be a proud one.--God be gracious to the soul of this good and noble knight, Sir Archibald de Hagenbach. He was the patron of my youth, and my guide to the path of honour. Eight steps have I made towards freedom and nobility on the heads of freeborn knights and nobles, who have fallen by his authority and command; and the ninth, by which I have attained it, is upon his own, in grateful memory of which I will expend this purse of gold, which but an hour since he bestowed on me, in masses for his soul. Gentlemen, noble friends, and now my equals, La Ferette has lost a nobleman and gained one. Our Lady be gracious to the departed knight, Sir Archibald de Hagenbach, and bless and prosper the progress of Stephen Steinernherz von Blutsacker, now free and noble of right!' With that he took the feather out of the cap of the deceased, which, soiled with the blood of the wearer, lay near his body upon the scaffold, and, putting it into his own official bonnet, received the homage of the crowd in loud huzzas, which were partly in earnest, partly in ridicule of such an unusual transformation. Arnold Biederman at length found breath, which the extremity of surprise had at first denied him. Indeed, the whole execution had passed much too rapidly for the possibility of his interference. 'Who has dared to act this tragedy?' he said indignantly. 'And by what right has it taken place?' A cavalier, richly dressed in blue, replied to the question-- 'The free citizens of Bale have acted for themselves, as the fathers of Swiss liberty set them an example; and the tyrant, De Hagenbach, has fallen by the same right which put to death the tyrant Geysler. We bore with him till his cup was brimming over, and then we bore no longer.' 'I say not but that he deserved death,' replied the Landamman; 'but for your own sake, and for ours, you should have forborne him till the Duke's pleasure was known.' 'What tell you us of the Duke?' answered Laurenz Neipperg, the same blue cavalier whom Arthur had seen at the secret rendezvous of the Balese youth, in company with Rudolph. 'Why talk you of Burgundy to us, who are none of his subjects? The Emperor, our only rightful lord, had no title to pawn the town and fortifications of La Ferette, being as it is a dependency of Bale, to the prejudice of our free city. He might have pledged the revenue indeed; and supposing him to have done so, the debt has been paid twice over by the exactions levied by yonder oppressor, who has now received his due. But pass on, Landamman of Unterwalden. If our actions displease you, abjure them at the footstool of the Duke of Burgundy; but, in doing so, abjure the memory of William Tell and Stauffacher, of Furst and Melchtal, the fathers of Swiss freedom.' 'You speak truth,' said the Landamman; 'but it is in an ill-chosen and unhappy time. Patience would have remedied your evils, which none felt more deeply, or would have redressed more willingly, than I. But oh, imprudent young man, you have thrown aside the modesty of your age, and the subjection you owe to your elders. William Tell and his brethren were men of years and judgment, husbands and fathers, having a right to be heard in council, and to be foremost in action. Enough--I leave it with the fathers and senators of your own city, to acknowledge or to reprove your actions.--But you, my friends,--you, Banneret of Berne,--you, Rudolph,--above all, you, Nicholas Bonstetten, my comrade and my friend, why did you not take this miserable man under your protection? The action would have shown Burgundy that we were slandered by those who have declared us desirous of seeking a quarrel with him, or of inciting his subjects to revolt. Now, all these prejudices will be confirmed in the minds of men, naturally more tenacious of evil impressions than of those which are favourable.' 'As I live by bread, good gossip and neighbour,' answered Nicholas Bonstetten, 'I thought to obey your injunctions to a tittle; so much so, that I once thought of breaking in and protecting the man, when Rudolph Donnerhugel reminded me that your last orders were, to stand firm, and let the men of Bale answer for their own actions; and surely, said I to myself, my gossip Arnold knows better than all of us what is fitting to be done.' 'Ah, Rudolph, Rudolph,' said the Landamman, looking on him with a displeased countenance, 'wert thou not ashamed thus to deceive an old man?' 'To say I deceived him is a hard charge; but from you, Landamman,' answered the Bernese, with his usual deference, 'I can bear anything. I will only say, that, being a member of this embassy, I am obliged to think, and to give my opinion as such, especially when he is not present who is wise enough to lead and direct us all.' 'Thy words are always fair, Rudolph,' replied Arnold Biederman, 'and I trust so is thy meaning. Yet there are times when I somewhat doubt it.--But let disputes pass, and let me have your advice, my friends; and for that purpose go we where it may best profit us, even to the church, where we will first return our thanks for our deliverance from assassination, and then hold counsel what next is to be done.' The Landamman led the way, accordingly, to the church of St. Paul's, while his companions and associates followed in their order. This gave Rudolph, who, as youngest, suffered the others to precede him, an opportunity to beckon to him the Landamman's eldest son, Rudiger, and whisper to him to get rid of the two English merchants. 'Away with them, my dear Rudiger, by fair means, if possible; but away with them directly. Thy father is besotted with these two English pedlars, and will listen to no other counsel; and thou and I know, dearest Rudiger, that such men as these are unfit to give laws to free-born Switzers. Get the trumpery they have been robbed of, or as much of it as is extant, together as fast as thou canst, and send them a-travelling, in Heaven's name.' Rudiger nodded intelligently, and went to offer his services to expedite the departure of the elder Philipson. He found the sagacious merchant as desirous to escape from the scene of confusion now presented in the town, as the young Swiss could be to urge his departure. He only waited to recover the casket of which De Hagenbach had possessed himself, and Rudiger Biederman set on foot a strict search after it, which was the more likely to be successful, that the simplicity of the Swiss prevented them from setting the true value upon its contents. A strict and hasty search was immediately instituted, both on the person of the dead De Hagenbach, on which the precious packet was not to be found, and on all who had approached him at his execution, or were supposed to enjoy his confidence. Young Arthur Philipson would gladly have availed himself of a few moments to bid farewell to Anne of Geierstein. But the grey wimple was no longer seen in the ranks of the Switzers, and it was reasonable to think that, in the confusion which followed the execution of De Hagenbach, and the retreat of the leaders of the little battalion, she had made her escape into some of the adjacent houses, while the soldiers around her, no longer restrained by the presence of their chiefs, had dispersed, some to search for the goods of which the Englishmen had been despoiled, others doubtless to mingle with and join in the rejoicings of the victorious youths of Bale, and of those burghers of La Ferette by whom the fortifications of the town had been so gently surrendered. The cry amongst them was universal, that Brisach, so long considered as the curb of the Swiss confederates, and the barrier against their commerce, should henceforth be garrisoned, as their protection against the encroachments and exactions of the Duke of Burgundy and his officers. The whole town was in a wild but joyful jubilee, while the citizens vied with each other in offering to the Swiss every species of refreshment, and the youths who attended upon the mission hurried gaily, and in triumph, to profit by the circumstances, which had so unexpectedly converted the ambuscade so treacherously laid for them, into a genial and joyous reception. Amid this scene of confusion, it was impossible for Arthur to quit his father, even to satisfy the feelings which induced him to wish for a few moments at his own disposal.""","""Execution and Swiss independence.""","2195","""Execution and Swiss Independence hold significant historical importance in the context of Switzerland's evolution as a nation. The concept of execution has been intertwined with the struggle for independence, shaping Switzerland's history and identity. This deep dive into the connection between execution and Swiss Independence will explore key events, individuals, and implications for the nation's development.  Execution, as a form of punishment, has played a dark role in human history across civilizations. In Switzerland, execution was a common method of enforcing justice and order in the medieval period. Beheading, hanging, and other forms of capital punishment were prevalent, reflecting the harsh realities of law enforcement in the past. Executions were often public spectacles, serving as deterrents to crime and reinforcing the power of rulers and authorities.  During the era of Swiss struggle for independence, execution took on a new meaning. The Swiss Confederacy was a union of independent states that banded together for mutual defense and autonomy against external forces. The Battle of Morgarten in 1315 marked a turning point in Swiss history, where the Swiss peasants successfully repelled an attack by the Habsburg forces, showcasing their military prowess and determination to safeguard their freedom.  The Swiss Confederacy continued to face challenges from neighboring powers, including the formidable Habsburg dynasty. One of the most renowned figures in Swiss history, William Tell, symbolizes the spirit of resistance against oppression. The legendary tale of Tell, a skilled marksman who defied the tyrannical Austrian bailiff Gessler and sparked a rebellion, resonates with the Swiss quest for independence and defiance against unjust rule.  As Swiss efforts towards independence intensified, executions became tools of suppression by external forces seeking to quell dissent. The execution of Arnold of Winkelried at the Battle of Sempach in 1386 exemplifies the sacrifices made by Swiss fighters in defense of their homeland. Winkelried's legendary act of self-sacrifice, where he gathered enemy spears to create an opening for his fellow soldiers, underscored the bravery and resolve of the Swiss in the face of adversity.  The Swiss Confederacy gradually expanded its territory and influence, forging alliances with neighboring regions and consolidating its independence. The pivotal Peace of Westphalia in 1648 recognized Switzerland as a sovereign state, solidifying its position on the European map. The Treaty of Westphalia marked a significant milestone in Swiss history, affirming its status as a neutral and independent nation, free from foreign interference.  The legacy of execution in Swiss history carries a complex narrative of justice, resistance, and nation-building. While executions were employed as tools of control by ruling powers, they also inspired defiance and unity among the Swiss people. The Swiss War of the Sonderbund in 1847, a conflict between conservative and liberal factions within Switzerland, highlighted the internal struggles that shaped the nation's path towards modernity and democratic governance.  Switzerland's commitment to neutrality and diplomacy has been a defining principle of its foreign policy. The Swiss tradition of armed neutrality, dating back to the Congress of Vienna in 1815, has allowed the country to navigate international conflicts without taking sides. Switzerland's neutrality during World War I and World War II preserved its independence and earned it a reputation as a haven of peace and stability in a turbulent world.  The Swiss model of direct democracy, where citizens have a direct say in decision-making through referendums and initiatives, reflects a deep-rooted commitment to democratic values and civic engagement. The Swiss political system, characterized by a decentralized federal structure and consensus-building, has contributed to the country's stability and prosperity.  In conclusion, the intertwined narratives of execution and Swiss independence illuminate the intricate tapestry of Switzerland's history. From medieval struggles for autonomy to modern-day diplomatic neutrality, Switzerland's journey as a nation has been marked by resilience, determination, and a commitment to freedom. The legacy of past sacrifices and struggles continues to shape Switzerland's identity as a peaceful and prosperous nation in the heart of Europe.""","793"
"Harper Andrew","""If we know anything about Moses at all, it is in the highest degree probable that he left his people some parting charge. He longed to pass the Jordan with them. He could not fail to see that an immense revolution in their habits and manner of life was certain to occur when they entered the promised land. That must have appeared to him fraught with varied dangers, and words of warning and instructions would rush even unbidden to his lips. There can be no doubt, at any rate, that this passage is true to human nature in regarding the sudden acquirement of great and goodly cities which they did not build, and houses full of good things which they filled not, and cisterns hewn out which they did not hew, vineyards and olive trees which they did not plant, as a great temptation to forgetfulness of God. At all times prosperity, especially if it come suddenly, and without being won by previous toil and self-denial, has tended to deteriorate character. When men have no changes or vicissitudes, then they fear not God. It is for help in trouble when the help of man is vain, or for a deliverance in danger, that average men most readily turn to God. But when they feel fairly safe, when they have raised themselves, as they think, 'beyond all storms of chance,' when they have built up between themselves and poverty or failure a wall of wealth and power, then the impulse that drives them upward ceases to act. It becomes strangely pleasant, and it seems safe, to get rid of the strain of living at the highest attainable level, and with a sigh of relief men stretch themselves out to rest and to enjoy. These are the average men; but there are some in every age, the elect, who have had the love of God shed abroad in their hearts, who have had such real and intimate communion with God that separation from Him would turn all other joys into mockery. They cannot yield to this temptation as most do, and in the midst of wealth and comfort keep alive their aspirations. In Israel these two classes existed; and to the former, i.e. to the great bulk of both rulers and people, the stimulus administered by the conquest to the material side of their nature must have been potent indeed. It is here implied that the Israelite people when they entered Canaan had some moral education to lose. Whether that could be so is the question asked by many critics, and their answer is an emphatic No. They were, say they, a rude, desert people, without settled habits of life, without knowledge of agriculture, and possessed of a religion which in all outward respects was scarcely, if at all, higher than that of the surrounding nations. What happened to them in Canaan, therefore, was not a lapse, but a rise. They advanced from being a wandering pastoral people to become settled agriculturists. They gained knowledge of the arts of life by their contact with the Canaanites, and they lost little or nothing in religion; for they were themselves only image-worshippers and looked upon Yahweh as on a level with the Canaanite Baals. But if the Decalogue belongs, in any form, to that early time, and if the character of Moses be in any degree historical, then, of course, this mode of view is false. Then Israel worshipped a spiritual God, who was the guardian of morals; and there was in the mind of their leader and legislator a light which illuminated every sphere of life, both private and national. Consequently there could be a falling away from a higher level of religious life, as the Scriptures consistently say there was. Without perhaps having understood and made their own the fundamental truths of Yahwism, the people had had their whole social and political life remodelled in accordance with its principles. They had, moreover, had time to learn something of its inner meaning, and in forty years we may well believe that the more spiritually minded among them had become imbued with the higher religious spirit. Add to that the union, the movement, the excitement of a successful advance, crowned by conquest, and we have all the elements of a revived religious and national life among Eastern people. Similar causes have produced precisely similar effects since. In important respects the origin of Mohammedanism repeats the same story. A semi-nomadic people, divided into clans and tribes, related by blood but never united, were unified by a great religious idea vastly in advance of any they had hitherto known. The religious reformer who proclaimed this truth, and those who belonged to the inner circle of his friends and counsellors, were turned from many evils, and exhibited a moral force and enthusiasm corresponding, in some degree at least, to the sublimity of the religious doctrine they had embraced. The masses, on their part, received and submitted to a revised and improved scheme of social life. Then they moved forward to conquest, and in their first days not only trampled down opposition, but deserved to do so, for in most respects they were superior to the ignorant and degraded Christians they overthrew. They came out of the desert, and were at first soldiers only. But in a generation or two they largely settled to purely agricultural life, as landowners for whom the native population laboured; and they gained in knowledge of the arts of life from the more civilised peoples they conquered. But in religious and moral character imitations of the conquered peoples involved, for the conquerors, a loss. And soon they did lose. The violence accompanying successful war produced arrogance and injustice; the immense wealth thrown into their hands so suddenly gave rise to luxury and greed. Within twenty-five years from the flight of Mohammed from Mecca, relaxation of manners manifested itself. Sensuality and drunkenness were rife; with Ali's death the Caliphate passed into the hands of Muawia, the leader of the still half-heathen part of the Koreish; and the secular indifferent portion of Mohammed's followers ruled in Islam. For an illustration of the way in which land-hunger and the rush to satisfy it operates on men, see the account of 'The Invasion of Oklahoma' (a territory lately thrown open to occupation in the United States), Spectator, April 7th, 889. Allowing all that can be allowed for exceptional influences in Israel, we may well believe that the circumstances of the first invaders were such as would strain the influence of the higher religion upon the nation. And after the conquest and settlement the strain would necessarily be greater still. Whatever drawbacks warfare may have, it at least keeps men active and hardy, but the rest of a conqueror after warfare is a temptation to luxury and corruption which has been very rarely resisted. Even to-day, when men enter upon new and vacant lands, and that without war and under Christian influences, the plenty which the first immigrants soon gather about them proves adverse to higher thought. In America in its earlier days, and in new American territories and Australia now, our civilisation at that stage always takes a materialistic turn. Every man may hope to become rich, the resources of the country are so great and those who are to share them are so few. In order to develop them, all concerned must give their time and thoughts to the work, and must become absorbed in it. The result is that, though the religious instinct asserts itself in sufficient strength to lead to the building of churches and schools, and men are too busy to be much influenced by theoretical unbelief, yet the pulse of religion beats feebly and low. The feeling spreads, under many disguises it is true, but still it spreads, that a man's life does 'consist in the abundance of the things which he possesseth'; and the heroic element of Christianity, the impulse to self-sacrifice, falls into the background. The result is a social life respectable enough, save that the social blots due to self-indulgence are a good deal more conspicuous than they should be; a very high average of general comfort, with its necessary drawback of a self-satisfied and somewhat ignoble contentment; and a religious life that prides itself mainly in avoiding the falsehood of extremes. In such an atmosphere true and living religion has great difficulty in asserting itself. Each individual is drawn away from the region of higher thought more powerfully than in the older lands where ambitions are for most men less plausible; and so the struggle to keep the soul sensitive to spiritual influences is more hard. As for the national life, public affairs in those circumstances tend to be ruled simply by the standard of immediate expediency, and strenuousness of principle or practice tends to be regarded as an impossible ideal. To all this Israel was exposed, and to more. There are doubts as to the extent of their conquests when they settled down; but there are none that when they did so they still had heathen Canaanites among them. Throughout almost the whole country the population was mixed, and constant intercourse with the conquered peoples was unavoidable. At first these were either Israel's teachers in many of the arts of settled life, or they must have carried on the work of agriculture for their Israelite lords. Moreover many of the sacred places of the land, the sanctuaries which from time immemorial had been resorted to for worship, were either taken over by the Israelites or were left in Canaanite hands. In either case they opened a way for malign influences upon the purer faith. Gradually, too, the tribal feeling asserted itself. The tribal heads regained the position they had held before the domination of Moses and his successor, just as the tribal heads of the Arabs asserted themselves after the death of Mohammed and his immediate successors, and plunged into fratricidal war with the companions of their prophet.""","""Moses, Israelite Conquest, Religious Influence""","2000","""Moses is a central figure in the religious and historical narratives of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. He is particularly renowned for his leadership of the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt and the subsequent events leading to their conquest of the Promised Land. Moses' legacy is deeply intertwined with the religious traditions and beliefs of these three major monotheistic religions, shaping the moral, ethical, and spiritual foundations of millions of people worldwide.  According to the Hebrew Bible, Moses was born during a time when the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt. His story begins with his miraculous rescue as an infant, hidden in a basket and discovered by Pharaoh's daughter. Raised in the royal court, Moses grew up with a strong sense of justice and empathy for his oppressed people. This empathy would later drive him to confront Pharaoh, demanding the release of the Israelites from bondage.  Moses' confrontation with Pharaoh is a pivotal moment in the Exodus narrative. Through a series of divine interventions and ten plagues, Moses and his brother Aaron finally secure the Israelites' freedom. The parting of the Red Sea, often portrayed as one of the most dramatic miracles attributed to Moses, allowed the Israelites to escape the pursuing Egyptian army and embark on their journey to the Promised Land.  The period of wandering in the wilderness following their departure from Egypt was a time of testing and purification for the Israelites. It was during this time that Moses received the Ten Commandments and the divine laws that would form the basis of Israelite society. Mount Sinai became the sacred site where Moses communed with God and relayed the laws and commandments to the people.  Moses' leadership during the Israelites' conquest of the Promised Land was marked by both triumphs and challenges. While he successfully led the Israelites to the borders of Canaan, he was forbidden from entering the land himself. The responsibility of leading the Israelites into Canaan fell to Joshua, marking the end of Moses' earthly journey.  The Israelite conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership marked a turning point in the history of ancient Israel. The military campaigns to claim the land as their own were justified through a religious lens, with the belief that God had promised this territory to the Israelites. The conquest of Canaan was a foundational event that established Israel as a nation and shaped its identity for centuries to come.  The religious influence of Moses and the Israelite conquest is evident in the enduring impact of these narratives on Western civilization. The story of the exodus from Egypt, the giving of the law at Mount Sinai, and the conquest of the Promised Land have been foundational to the moral and ethical values of Judeo-Christian societies. The principles of justice, compassion, and obedience to divine law that Moses exemplified continue to influence religious thought and practice to this day.  In Judaism, Moses is revered as the greatest prophet and lawgiver in the history of the Israelites. His role in delivering the Israelites from bondage in Egypt and leading them to the Promised Land is commemorated in Jewish festivals and rituals, such as Passover and Shavuot. The Torah, believed to have been revealed to Moses by God, stands as the central text of Jewish religious and ethical teachings.  In Christianity, Moses is recognized as a key figure in the Old Testament whose life and teachings foreshadowed the coming of Jesus Christ. The moral and spiritual lessons found in the life of Moses serve as a foundation for Christian beliefs in salvation, redemption, and the fulfillment of God's promises. The parallels drawn between Moses as a liberator of the Israelites and Jesus as the savior of humanity highlight the continuity of divine intervention in human history.  In Islam, Moses is revered as one of the prominent prophets (or """"messengers"""") mentioned in the Qur'an. Known as Musa in Arabic, his story is recounted in multiple chapters of the Qur'an, emphasizing his role as a messenger of God sent to guide the Israelites. The Quranic narrative aligns with the biblical accounts of Moses' miracles, leadership, and the delivery of divine revelations.  The legacy of Moses and the Israelite conquest continues to resonate in contemporary discussions on religion, history, and ethics. The themes of liberation, justice, and faith that pervade these narratives serve as a source of inspiration and reflection for individuals seeking guidance in their own journeys. By studying the life and teachings of Moses, one can glean valuable insights into the complexities of leadership, the challenges of faith, and the enduring power of divine providence.  In conclusion, Moses' leadership of the Israelites during the exodus from Egypt and the subsequent conquest of the Promised Land remains a timeless testament to the enduring influence of religious traditions on human history. His role as a prophet, lawgiver, and liberator has left an indelible mark on the beliefs and practices of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Through his courage, wisdom, and unwavering faith in God, Moses continues to serve as a powerful symbol of hope and redemption for believers around the world.""","1018"
"Casseday Ben","""To those who know how properly to estimate the value of educational privileges, the training of their children is an all-important consideration; and, as nothing can supply the want of parental care, it is not uncommon for families to seek as a residence those places which at once possess great facilities for instruction, and are free from the dangers of ill-health. Louisville has both these advantages, and hence this city owes to these facts much of her best population. The healthiness of Louisville is everywhere a subject of remark. Its past reputation for insalubrity is long since forgotten, and its singular exemption from those epidemic diseases whose ravages have been so terrible in other places, have gained for it a very enviable distinction among cities. The following recent report of the Committee on Public Health of the Louisville Medical Society will tend still further to confirm what has just been said: 'Since the years 822 and 823,' says this document, 'the endemic fevers of summer and autumn have become gradually less frequent, until within the last five or six years they have almost ceased to prevail, and those months are now as free from disease as those of any part of the year. Typhoid fever is a rare affection here, and a majority of the cases seen occur in persons recently from the country. Some physicians residing in the interior of this State see more of the disease than comes under the joint observation of all the practitioners of the city, if we exclude those treated in the Hospital. 'Tubercular disease, particularly pulmonary consumption, is not so much seen as in the interior of Kentucky. Our exemption from pulmonary consumption is remarkable, and it would be a matter of much interest if a registration could be made of all the deaths from it, so that we could compare them with those of other places. 'For the truth of the remarks as to the extent and frequency of the diseases enumerated we rely solely upon what we have observed ourselves, and upon what we have verbally gathered from our professional friends. 'This exemption of Louisville from disease, can be accounted for in no other way than from its natural situation, and from what has been done in grading, in building, and in laying off the streets. 'Louisville is situated on an open plain, where the wind has access from every direction; upon a sandy soil, which readily absorbs the water that falls upon it; susceptible of adequate drainings; supplied bountifully with pure lime stone water, which is filtered through a depth of thirty or forty feet of sand; its streets are wide and laid off at right angles--north and south, east and west--giving the freest ventilation; and the buildings compact, comfortable, and generally so constructed as to be dry and to admit freely the fresh air. It is situated upon the border of the beautiful Ohio, and environed by one of the richest agricultural districts in the world, supplying it with abundance of food, and all the comforts and luxuries of life. It must, under the guidance of science and wise legislation, become, if it is not already, one of the healthiest cities in the world. Its proximity to the rapids of the Ohio may add to its salubrity, and it is certain that the evening breezes wafted over them, produce an exhilarating effect, beyond what is derived from the perpetual music of the roar of the falls.' It may be proper to add the following table of the comparative statistics of annual mortality of the resident population as ascertained from official sources. In Louisville the deaths are one to 0. Philadelphia do do 6. New York do do 7. Boston do do 8. Cincinnati do do 5/8. Naples do do 8. Paris do do 3. London do do 9. Glasgow do do 4. The Market Houses of Louisville, five in number and all located upon Market Street, are profusely supplied with every production of this latitude. Markets are held every day, and prices are much lower than in Eastern cities. The Kentucky beef and pork which is everywhere so celebrated, is here found in its true perfection. The vegetables and fruits peculiar to this climate, are also offered in excellent order and in great abundance. Irish and sweet potatoes, green peas, corn, cucumbers, lettuce, radishes, asparagus, celery, salsafie, pie plant, melons, peaches, apples, cherries, strawberries, and many other vegetables and fruits are plentifully supplied. The Irish potato is sold at from twenty-five to forty cents per bushel, green peas command about twenty cents per peck, strawberries fifty cents per gallon. The choice pieces of beef can be had at from six to eight cents per pound, less desirable pieces bring three and four cents. Pork is bought at about five cents per pound. Turkies bring fifty to seventy-five cents each. Spring chickens, from seventy-five to one dollar and fifty cents per dozen. Ducks, fifteen to twenty-five cents each. Eggs are sold at four to eight cents per dozen. Butter, fifteen to twenty cents per pound. The lamb and mutton sold in this market, cannot be surpassed in point of quality in the United States. The extreme fertility of the country around Louisville, and its perfect adaptation to the wants of the gardener and the stockraiser, must always give to this city the advantage of an excellent and cheap provision market.

And it is well to state here, however discreditable such statement may be to the city, that no business organization of any kind has ever been attempted and no statistical tables have ever been kept either by the city government, by societies or individuals. The only means left to the statistician, therefore, have been the tedious and often incomplete process of personal application and investigation. The statistics which are here offered to the reader are derived from the best authority and are believed to be correct, but are necessarily far less complete than could have been wished. This outline will, however, serve to give some idea of the general business character of the city.

"Peck Annie S  Annie Smith ","""One does not go to Cuzco for the luxuries of New York or Paris, but if unhappy without these he must postpone this part of the journey a while longer. One writer says that the Comercio affords reasonably good meals and decent bedrooms. Other opinions are less favorable, but conditions may have improved by now. On the spur of a hill which closes the head of the valley, at an altitude of 1,00 feet, is situated the ancient imperial city. Some knowledge of the history of its rulers, the greatness of its domain, the development of its civilization, the magnificence of its temples, the power and riches of its princes, and the terrible tragedy of their downfall gives a keener interest to the massive ruins, the delightful prospect, and to everything in this remote valley which is connected with the unique and wonderful empire of world-wide and immortal fame. At the time of its capture, four centuries ago, few if any cities in the world could rival Cuzco in the magnificence of its temples, and their treasures of gold and silver, and none in the massive fortifications and other constructions of which the remains are still a marvel. In the history of this ancient city there are at least four periods: the prac-Inca age; the glorious epoch of the Inca dynasty; the merciless, mournful days of bloodshed and destruction, followed by the brilliant reconstruction and the relentless rule of the Spanish invaders; and the slow progress of the modern republic. From the earliest period date the megalithic ruins of Sacsahuaman and elsewhere, regarded as belonging to the same age as those of Tiahuanaco and a few other places, their origin alike involved in mystery. Sir Clements Markham, the most careful student of this early civilization, believes it to be an indigenous growth of great antiquity, though there is a tradition of an early outside influence from the south. The great empire of the Incas was of comparatively short duration; according to commonly accepted tradition, it existed for about four centuries. The most current and approved legend of the Incas origin is that they were the children of the Sun, who pitying the sad condition of his creatures sent to their aid two of his offspring, Manco Ccapac and Mama Oclla, brother and sister, also husband and wife. These first appearing on the Island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca thence came to Cuzco and established their dominion. Manco seems to have been a great and wise ruler, probably of Quichua origin, and to have lived in the twelfth century. His successor Sinchi Rocca was a peaceful ruler, but the third Inca, Lloque Yupanqui, subjugated some of the neighboring peoples. The fourth, Maita Ccapac, was a greater warrior, extending his kingdom over most of Bolivia, and to Arequipa and Moquegua. The fifth Inca, Ccapac Yupanqui, who was called avaricious, employed his reign in subduing insurrections in regions already conquered. His successor, Inca Rocca, was an eminent warrior and statesman, who built great palaces, founded schools for the education of the nobility, and made strict laws for the welfare and protection of the people, with severe punishment, even death, to murderers, incendiaries, and thieves. The seventh Inca, Titu Cusi Hualpa, was less successful. An invasion by the tribes of Chinchasuyo caused him to flee in alarm, but his son, collecting an army, defeated the invaders and was then crowned, with the name of Viracocha. During his reign eleven provinces were added to the empire, and a magnificent temple was erected twenty miles south of Cuzco with an altar to Viracocha, a deity who had appeared to the prince to warn him of the coming invasion, informing him that he was the creator of man, the world, the sun, and all else. A remarkable engineering feat of this reign was the construction of an irrigating canal nearly four hundred miles long and twelve feet deep to convert some plains below into green pasture lands. The eldest son of Viracocha, who was of small account, was presently succeeded by his brother Pachacutec who brought still greater glory to the empire. With the excellent armies organized by Pachacutec, his son Tupac Yupanqui made conquests along the coast from Pisco north including Pachacamac, the realm of the Grand Chimu near Trujillo, and the valley of Cajamarca. These cities were not destroyed, but were left under the dominion of their former rulers as vassals to the Inca, the worship of the Sun being associated with their former religion; but the learning and use of the Quichua language was made compulsory. Every government official and soldier was obliged to speak this language. After the death of Pachacutec at the age of eighty, his son Tupac Yupanqui, the tenth Inca, conquered Chile as far as the Maule River and spent three years in a tour to the various parts of his empire. Some uncertainty exists about an Inca Yupanqui, but a younger son of Tupac called Huayna Ccapac, near the close of his fathers reign, carried still farther the conquests even to Quito, which he won from its king. His reign was one of wisdom until its close. The rightful heir Huascar, son of the Coya or Queen, had a rival in his fathers affections, a younger son, Atahuallpa, of another, Pacha. Having himself retired to Quito before his death, Huayna Ccapac left that province to his son Atahuallpa, and the throne of Cuzco to Huascar. Thus happened the division, so disastrous to the Inca dynasty, possibly altering in some measure the whole of Peruvian history. The location of Cuzco is said to be more beautiful than that of Quito or Bogota, both of world-wide fame. Rome, Athens, and Sparta, in the opinion of many, present less charming scenes than that which is outspread before the observer on Sacsahuaman. Yet how altered from the days of its glory! Then the hills around, fertilized with guano and small fish and irrigated throughout their entire extent, were terraced and cultivated to their summits. Then the city and its suburbs are said to have contained 00,00 souls. The gates of the walled enclosure were of colored marble. Within were great palaces, their walls painted in bright colors. The Temple of the Sun was covered with a roof of gold. In the gardens around were artificial flowers of gold and silver, figures of animals large and small, wild and domestic, of herbs, plants, and trees; a field of maize, fruit trees, images of men, women, and children. The doors were covered with gold plate. A gold cornice more than a yard deep, around the building, did not remain long in place after the occupation by the Spaniards. The golden roof had been removed previous to their arrival. This sumptuous temple called Coricancha, Place of Gold, begun by the first Inca, Manco Ccapac, was not concluded for many generations until the time of Inca Yupanqui, each Inca in the meantime contributing a share towards the completion of the great work. The form of the temple was elliptical, and opposite the entrance where the rays of the rising sun would fall upon it was a gold effigy representing the Sun. Golden rays projected from his head so that the entire creation occupied one side of the temple. When the suns rays fell upon the figure the effect was indeed dazzling, lighting up the place with such radiance that the Indian Nobles, who alone were permitted to enter, prostrated themselves, striking their foreheads on the pavement. The only women allowed within the temple were the wife and daughters of the ruling Inca. On each side of the deity were arranged the dead mummified bodies of the Incas, clad in royal robes, seated upon golden thrones, with eyes downcast and hands folded across their breasts. One only, Huayna Ccapac, faced the god, one story says because he was the best loved, another, because he dared to gaze at the sun and show that this luminary was not the creative lord. Beyond this, the chief holy place of the temple, was a rectangular cloister with five square chapels around. One dedicated to the Moon contained a silver image of a womans face. In this chapel were arranged the bodies of the Queens called Coyas, as were the Incas in the chamber of the Sun. The next hall, its ceiling covered with silver stars, was dedicated to the Stars; the third, adorned with gold, was to Thunder and Lightning. Next came the hall of the Rainbow with colored delineations on gold plate, and finally a hall covered with gold where the priests gave audience. Many jewels, emeralds and turquoise, were set in the mouldings of gold. The bodies of the Incas were removed before the coming of the invaders, but in 5/85/89 five were discovered and subsequently carried to Lima, where they were buried in the patio of the San Andres hospital. Four streets which led to the temple of the Sun are now called Carcel, Loreto, Santa Catalina, and San Augustin. Near by, where now is the convent of Santa Catalina, was the House of the Virgins, who, like the Vestals at Rome, fed the sacred fire. Of these there were 5/800 or more, some from Cuzco of royal lineage, others from the provinces, selected for their beauty from those of high birth. They spun and wove the clothing of the Inca and his Queen and had various other duties. Their dishes and utensils were of gold. They entered the convent before they were eight years of age and here, vowed to chastity, they spent their lives. This building was 00 by 00 feet. Each Inca built for himself a great palace, and above were the wonderful fortifications of Sacsahuaman. West of the town is a place called Huaca-puncu, Holy Gate, which is approached by a steep street. At a certain spot every Indian paused to look back or forward, this being the first or last point from which could be seen the Temple of the Sun. And still today, as four centuries ago, the Indians continue this ancient custom.""","""Cuzco: History and Inca Civilization""","2179","""Cuzco, a city in southeastern Peru, is renowned for its rich history intertwined with the Inca civilization. As the historic capital of the Inca Empire, Cuzco holds a significant place in South America's cultural heritage. The city's story begins long before the Inca civilization, with evidence of human settlement in the area dating back over 3,000 years. However, it was the rise of the Inca Empire in the 13th century that truly shaped Cuzco into the cultural and administrative center of their vast realm.  The Incas, a Quechua-speaking people, established Cuzco as their capital around 1100 AD. However, it was under the rule of Pachacuti, the ninth Sapa Inca (emperor), that Cuzco flourished into a grand city with impressive architecture, intricate stonework, and a complex network of roads connecting the empire. Pachacuti is credited with transforming Cuzco into the imperial capital and expanding the Inca territory through military conquests and strategic alliances.  One of the most emblematic structures in Cuzco is the famous Sacsayhuamán fortress, a testament to the Inca's advanced engineering skills. The massive stone walls of Sacsayhuamán, built without mortar, showcase the precision and ingenuity of Inca architecture. The Incas' ability to construct such monumental structures without modern tools is a testament to their architectural prowess and organizational capabilities.  In addition to its architectural marvels, Cuzco was a hub of religious and ceremonial significance for the Incas. The city was designed in the shape of a puma, an animal sacred to the Incas, with key sites such as the Coricancha (Temple of the Sun) and the Plaza de Armas serving as important religious centers. These sites were where rituals, ceremonies, and offerings to the gods took place, highlighting the spiritual importance of Cuzco in Inca society.  The Inca Empire reached its peak under the reign of Huayna Capac, the last great Sapa Inca before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors. In 1533, Francisco Pizarro and his forces captured Cuzco, marking the end of the Inca Empire and the beginning of Spanish colonial rule in the region. The conquerors dismantled many Inca structures and used the stones to build churches and palaces, forever altering the city's architectural landscape.  Despite the Spanish conquest and the destruction of many Inca sites, Cuzco managed to preserve its indigenous heritage and traditions. Today, the city is a blend of Inca and colonial influences, with Inca walls serving as foundations for Spanish colonial buildings. The Spanish built churches and cathedrals atop former Inca temples, creating a unique architectural fusion that represents the city's complex history.  Cuzco's historical and cultural significance led to its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. The city's well-preserved archaeological sites, colonial architecture, and vibrant indigenous culture attract millions of visitors each year. Travelers come to Cuzco not only to explore its ancient ruins and museums but also to experience the rich Andean traditions that continue to thrive in the city.  In addition to its historical attractions, Cuzco is the gateway to Machu Picchu, the iconic Inca citadel located high in the Andes Mountains. Machu Picchu, a marvel of engineering and design, is a symbol of the Inca Empire's sophistication and ingenuity. The site's stunning mountain setting and well-preserved ruins make it one of the most visited archaeological sites in the world, drawing history enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike.  Cuzco's allure lies not only in its historical significance but also in its vibrant culture, colorful markets, and traditional festivals. The city's streets are lined with artisans selling handicrafts, textiles, and jewelry, showcasing the creativity and craftsmanship of the local Quechua communities. Visitors can immerse themselves in Andean traditions by attending festivals such as Inti Raymi, the Festival of the Sun, which celebrates the winter solstice and honors the Inca sun god.  In conclusion, Cuzco stands as a living testament to the grandeur and ingenuity of the Inca civilization. From its ancient roots as the capital of an empire to its modern-day status as a cultural mecca, Cuzco continues to captivate visitors with its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant traditions. By exploring Cuzco's archaeological sites, wandering its cobblestone streets, and interacting with its welcoming inhabitants, travelers can embark on a fascinating journey through time to uncover the secrets of this extraordinary city.""","949"
"May James Vance","""Krafft-Ebing was responsible for the following delimitation of the psychoneuroses, which he admits to be 'somewhat dogmatic' and has used for many years largely for didactic purposes: '1. Parasitic, accidentally acquired diseases in individuals whose cerebral functions were previously normal and whose disease could not be foreseen. 2. Disease based upon temporary disposition (grave physical disease and the simultaneous action of powerful exciting causes), hereditary predisposition not excluded, but only latently present in the brain of one easily affected, but previously normal in its functions. 3. Tendency to cure of the disease and infrequency of relapses. 4. Slight tendency to transmission to descendants, and when it occurs, in benign forms (psychoneuroses). 5. Typic course of the disease picture. Mania, as a rule, arises from a melancholic initial stage; and so-called secondary conditions are the terminations of primary conditions. The disease picture, even when it appears, has a certain duration and independence. The whole course of the disease is quite narrowly limited in time, and goes on either to recovery or dementia. 6. No tendency to periodicity of the attacks or the grouping of symptoms. 7. Sanity and insanity are sharply defined, and in striking contrast.' In this group he includes mania, melancholia, acute curable dementia and primary hallucinatory delirium. He describes hysteria, neurasthenia, etc., under the psychic degenerations with paranoia and speaks of them as constitutional neuroses. His psychoneuroses certainly do not come within the general acceptation of the term at this time but represent the views of a certain school of German writers. More recently the words neurosis and psychoneurosis have been used as synonymous terms by many writers. Kempf has even gone so far as to suggest discarding the word psychosis completely. In any event, the view that we should only designate as psychoneuroses such functional conditions as are clearly due to psychic causes seems to be gaining ground. The term neurosis is generally applied at this time to diseases primarily physical rather than mental in their symptomatology. The prominence of psychogenic factors has been given great weight in recent literature. In the second edition of his work on Psychiatry, Diefendorf makes the following statement: 'Neuroses are commonly designated as a group of diseases characterized by changing and transitory nervous disturbances, to be distinguished from psychoses by the fact that the symptoms do not involve the mental field. But in practice psychoses without nervous symptoms or neuroses without mental symptoms are not encountered.' Since the term was first introduced by Morel in 1860, many French writers, such as Régis and Magnan, have emphasized the importance of the insanity of degeneracy. This included moral insanity, the sexual perversions and various other psychopathic conditions as well as the obsessions, compulsions, impulsions, phobias, doubts, etc., now recognized as psychogenic in origin and usually assigned collectively to the psychoneuroses under the designation of psychasthenia. In his sixth edition Kraepelin included both hysteria and epilepsy in his group of neuroses, while constitutional peculiarities of character, as well as compulsive and impulsive insanity with sexual perversions, were classified under the psychopathic states (degenerative insanity). In his seventh edition epilepsy was described as a separate entity. In the eighth edition we find a new grouping. The psychogenic conditions are divided into nervous exhaustion (neurasthenia), the dread neuroses, induced insanity, the paranoid conditions of the deaf, the traumatic neuroses, the prison and the 'querulant' psychoses. Hysteria now appears separately. Under the constitutional psychopathic disorders he discusses nervousness, compulsion neuroses, impulsive insanity and the sexual perversions. In view of these varying conceptions which are fairly representative of the literature of the day, we are certainly on safe ground in confining a consideration of the psychoneuroses to hysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia and various other conditions characterized by anxiety and fears. Hysteria has long been a subject of interest and controversy. It has been a topic of discussion since the time of Esquirol and even Sydenham. It was studied exhaustively by Brachet in 1847. Briquet in 1859 defined hysteria as 'an encephalic neurosis whose apparent phenomena consist principally in the perturbation of the vital actions which serve to manifest the affective sensations and passions.' Lasègue wrote an elaborate treatise on the subject in 1864. It was discussed in detail later by Möbius, Charcot and many others. To Möbius hysteria was 'a congenital morbid mental state where diseased bodily conditions are produced by ideas.' During the last twenty or thirty years many new and interesting theories have been advanced. Binet sees in hysteria a condition of double consciousness, the two states almost entirely independent and separated by periods of amnesia. Janet's interesting conception of the disease is covered in full in his definition: 'Hysteria is a mental disease belonging to the large group of the diseases due to weakness, to cerebral exhaustion; it has only rather vague physical symptoms, consisting especially in a general diminution of nutrition; it is above all characterized by moral symptoms, the principal one being a weakness of the faculty of psychological synthesis, an abulia, a contraction of the field of consciousness manifesting itself in a particular way; a certain number of elementary phenomena, sensations and images, cease to be perceived and appear suppressed by the personal perception; the result is a tendency to a complete and permanent division of the personality, to the formation of several groups independent of each other; these systems of psychological factors alternate, some in the wake of others, or coexist; in fine, this lack of synthesis favors the formation of certain parasitic ideas which develop completely and in isolation under the shelter of the control of the personal consciousness and which manifest themselves by the most varied disturbances, apparently only physical.' He summarized this as a complete doubling (dédoublement literally undoubling, as translated by Corson) of the personality. On analysis there is fundamentally much in this view strongly suggestive of the theories of Breuer and Freud. Babinski interprets hysteria as a purely psychic functional disturbance due to suggestion. He would eliminate from this field all symptoms which cannot be induced by suggestion and relieved by methods of persuasion. The ordinary physical manifestations of the disease, such as anesthesia, hyperesthesia, paralyses, convulsions, etc., Babinski describes as stigmata. His theories lead him to suggest 'pithiatism' as the correct name for hysteria. A revolutionary and epochmaking contribution to the literature of this important subject was the publication of their 'Studien über Hysterie' by Breuer and Freud in 1895. The latter has made various further expositions of his views more recently. What the ultimate outcome of the hysteria problem may be, only time can determine. No consideration of the subject, however, is complete, nor should any definite conclusions be attempted, without a thorough understanding of theories which have a material bearing on the mental mechanisms involved in all of the psychoneuroses. Breuer and Freud advanced the suggestion that hysteria is always the result of a psychic trauma. The mechanisms involved may be very briefly summarized. Studies of everyday life show that the peculiar amnesia often observed for certain names and events does not mean usually in the average individual a mere fading of memory with the lapse of time. Freud found that the inability to recall things in such cases is largely due to the fact that they are for some reason or other unpleasant in nature and therefore not desirable to remember. They are accordingly pushed into the background as it were, by burying them in the subconscious strata of the mind and intentionally obliterating them from memory. When the ordinary well balanced individual is confronted with an unpleasant situation he meets it as best he can, by the exhibition of normal reactions of various sorts. He treats the matter lightly, dismisses it as a joke or 'laughs it off.' His dignity may be maintained by a display of anger or resentment. The mental equilibrium may be restored by a resort to profanity, tears, violence, or even physical flight. An emotional outlet in the form of hate or thoughts of revenge may be necessary to settle the question and finally dispose of it by 'getting it off the mind.' There are unpleasant situations which for various reasons cannot be met and treated in this ordinary way. The mental shock of the 'psychic trauma' may, for instance, be the result of an occurrence which is so distasteful and repulsive as to be incompatible with the present existence. There being no other escape from such a difficulty, it is rejected by the psychic censor, to use Freud's expression, and repressed or forced into the subconscious. This is the inadequate reaction which takes place in hysteria and leads to a dissociation and rudimentary splitting of the consciousness. Freud finds that in practically every instance the repressed and painful idea is due to a psychic trauma resulting from some incident of a sexual nature; furthermore, that it usually dates back to the time of childhood.""","""Psychoneuroses and Hysteria Analysis""","1892","""Psychoneuroses are a group of mental disorders characterized by emotional distress and anxiety. These conditions can significantly impact a person's ability to function in daily life, affecting their relationships, work, and overall well-being. Among the various psychoneuroses is hysteria, a condition that has a long and complex history within the field of psychology. Understanding psychoneuroses and hysteria analysis is crucial for mental health professionals to provide effective treatment and support for individuals experiencing these conditions.  Psychoneuroses encompass a range of disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder. These conditions often involve excessive worry, fear, or unease that can be debilitating for those affected. Symptoms of psychoneuroses can manifest physically, emotionally, and behaviorally, leading to distress and impairment in various areas of life. Treatment typically involves a combination of psychotherapy, medication, and lifestyle changes to help individuals manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.  Hysteria, once considered a distinct mental disorder, is now recognized as a manifestation of underlying psychological distress. Historically, hysteria was believed to be specific to women and was associated with unexplained physical symptoms such as paralysis, tremors, and fits. Sigmund Freud, a prominent figure in the field of psychology, played a significant role in shaping the understanding of hysteria through his work on psychoanalysis. Freud's theories emphasized the role of unconscious conflicts and repressed emotions in the development of hysteria, paving the way for modern psychoanalytic approaches to mental health treatment.  Hysteria analysis involves exploring the underlying psychological factors that contribute to the manifestation of physical symptoms. Psychodynamic therapy, a form of psychoanalysis, is often used to help individuals with hysteria uncover and address unresolved issues from their past that may be influencing their present symptoms. By delving into the unconscious mind and examining hidden conflicts and desires, therapists aim to help patients gain insight into the root causes of their distress and develop healthier coping mechanisms.  One key concept in hysteria analysis is conversion disorder, where psychological distress is converted into physical symptoms. This phenomenon underscores the interconnected nature of the mind and body, highlighting how emotional turmoil can manifest as physical ailments. By addressing the underlying emotional issues through therapy, individuals with conversion disorder can experience relief from their physical symptoms as they work through unresolved psychological conflicts.  Another important aspect of hysteria analysis is the recognition of the role of trauma in the development of psychoneuroses. Traumatic experiences, such as abuse, neglect, or violence, can have a profound impact on an individual's mental health and contribute to the development of psychological symptoms like hysteria. Therapy approaches such as trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy aim to help individuals process and make sense of their traumatic experiences in a safe and supportive environment, enabling them to move towards healing and recovery.  It is essential for mental health professionals to approach psychoneuroses and hysteria analysis with empathy, compassion, and cultural sensitivity. Each individual's experience is unique, and factors such as personal history, cultural background, and social context can influence the presentation of symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment approaches. By adopting a holistic and person-centered approach, therapists can create a safe space for individuals to explore their innermost thoughts and feelings, paving the way for healing and growth.  In conclusion, psychoneuroses and hysteria analysis play a significant role in understanding and addressing mental health challenges. By recognizing the interplay between psychological factors and physical symptoms, therapists can help individuals unravel the complexities of their distress and work towards a path of recovery. Through empathetic care, evidence-based interventions, and a deep understanding of the complexities of these conditions, mental health professionals can support individuals in navigating the challenges posed by psychoneuroses and hysteria, guiding them towards a healthier and more fulfilling life.""","764"
"Fustel de Coulanges","""Pecunia, in legal phraseology, is used not only of money, of not only personal property, but also of property of every kind, including land; and fructus does not simply mean produce in the literal sense of the word, but revenues of every description. Csar, then, is speaking of possessions of every sort, of which the income may be set aside. These possessions may be an estate under cultivation, or a herd of cattle, or a stock in trade, or a sum of money placed out at compare the three fragments 7, 0, and 11; and you will recognise that the Romans were in the habit of calling a domain ager and the buildings on it dificium. Now Csar, in speaking of the Gauls, often uses the word agri and still more often dificia. Here are the domains and the vill which M. de Jubainville was looking for. These dificia were farms, not huts. They contained as a rule a somewhat numerous rural population; for Csar notes in one instance as something exceptional that he found in the dificia of the Bellovaci only a small number of men, as almost all had set out for the war (viii. ). They also included barns for the storing of crops; for the historian mentions that the Tencteri, having invaded the country of the Menapii, supported themselves for several months on the corn that they found in the dificia (iv. ). The Roman general was well aware that if he wished to find forage for his cavalry he must look for it in these farms, pabulum ex dificiis petere (vii., and viii. 0). What Csar says about the dificium of Ambiorix shows that it was a large enough building to lodge a numerous body of followers. And so the words ager and dificium take the place in Csar of the words fundus and villa, and disprove the assertion that the Gauls had neither domains nor farms before the conquest. M. de Jubainville compares the whole Gallic territory with the ager publicus of Rome. I do not know whether the learned medievalist has a very clear conception of what the ager publicus really was. The subject is a very difficult one, and requires for its study a good deal of time, much minute research and great familiarity with Roman habits and customs. I do not wish to dwell on this point; and will content myself with saying that the ager publicus was not common land, but property of the State existing side by side with private property. To suppose that in Gaul the State was the master of all the soil and distributed it annually amongst the citizens, is to suppose something absolutely opposed to Roman habits and to the usages of the ager publicus. Moreover, it is impossible to find a single line in Csar which authorises such a supposition. To sum up: the attempt made by this ingenious scholar to discover community in land amongst the Gauls is supported by no original authorities. When we come to verify his quotations and test his arguments, we see that not one of his quotations bears the sense he attributes to it, and that not one of his facts fits in with a theory of common ownership in land. It is wisest to keep strictly to what Csar tells us. Fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt. It is well known that in legal language, the judicia publica are criminal cases; as the term implies, cases which concern crimes punished by a public authority; the judicia privata are those which concern private interests alone, and in which the State is not involved. See on this distinction Paul, Sententi, I.,,; Ulpian XIII.,; Fragmenta Vaticana, 97 and 26; Digest,., tit. and;., I.; I., l, l;.,, 3, 1 and 2. To translate controversi public in the passage from Csar as disputes between two peoples would run counter to the meaning of words. Publicus never means inter duos populos. It may be added that the social condition described by Csar is irreconcilable with agrarian communism, vi., 3: in omni Gallia plebs pne serrorum habetur loco, etc. Notice the numerous clients of Orgetorix, i.,; those of Vercingetorix, vii.,; the many poor, not in the towns, but in the country, in agris agentes, vii.,; the burden of the tributa, vi., 3. These traits are not those of a society where the land is common. They point rather to a system of great estates, with the soil in the hands of the magnates. This appears in the Comptes rendus de lAcademie des inscriptions et belles-lettres, 887, pp. 5/8, et seq. M. de Jubainville has translated controversi public, as if it were controversi inter duos populos. I know of no example in Latin literature where the word publicus has this sense. In Suetonius, Augustus, 9, the judicia publica are certainly not suits between peoples: they are criminal suits. When Cicero, defending Roscius of Ameria, says he is conducting his first causa publica, it is clear that he is not arguing for one people against another. He is defending Roscius, who is accused of parricide: it is a criminal proceeding. Csar, vi. 2: Nec proprios. Ibidem: ne latos parare studeant, potentioresque humiliores possessionibus expellant. Or else the same thing is implied by the turn of the sentence, i.: Helvetii a finibus suis exeunt; iv.: quum Suevi Ubios finibus expellere non possent; vi. 3: extra fines cujusque civitatis; v. 6: fines regni sui; v. 7: Ambiorix tutum iter per fines suos pollicetur. By a natural transition, fines comes to mean sometimes, not only the boundaries, but also the territory itself, vi. 2: ut Ambiorigis fines depopularentur. Cicero, Topica, 0: Si de finibus controversia est, fines agrorum esse videntur. DArbois de Jubainville, in the Comptes rendus de lAcademie des inscriptions, 887, reprint, pp. -2. Gaius iii. 24: Appellatione pecuni omnes res in lege significantur. fundum vel hominem. Digest, L. 6, 22: pecuni nomine non solum numerata pecunia, sed omnes res tam soli quam mobiles continentur. Cf. S. Augustine, De Discipl. Christ., i.: omnia quorum domini sumus pecunia vocantur; servus, ager, arbor, pecus, pecunia dicitur. Comptes rendus de lAcademie des inscriptions, session of June, 886, reprint, p.. M. de Jubainville does not translate latin texts very exactly. For example, if he sees in Csar that no German possesses agri modum certum, he immediately says that this ager must be the ager publicus; because in Rome modus agri was the technical expression for the ager publicus. But where has he seen that? He may read in Varro, de re rustica, i. 4, the words de modo agri, which incontestably mean concerning the extent of a private property. He will find the same expression in Varro, i. 8, where the writer says that the number of rural slaves ought to be proportionate to the extent of the domain. And again he will find the jurisconsult Paul, in the Digest, xviii.,. 0, using modum agri for the area of an estate which an individual has just bought. To prove that ager by itself means ager publicus he cites the lex Thoria; without noticing that in that law the ager publicus is mentioned eleven times, and that ager does not once stand for the public land unless accompanied by publicus or populi. Conclusion. Are we to conclude from all that has gone before that nowhere and at no time was land held in common? By no means. To commit ourselves to so absolute a negative would be to go beyond the purpose of this work. The only conclusion to which we are brought by this prolonged examination of authorities is that community in land has not yet been historically proved.""","""Roman land ownership and legal terminology""","1829","""In ancient Rome, land ownership was a crucial aspect of society, shaping the economic, social, and political landscape of the civilization. The Roman legal system was highly developed, with specific terminologies and laws governing the ownership and transfer of land. Understanding Roman land ownership and legal terminology provides insights into the complexities of Roman society and its legal framework.  The Roman system of land ownership was characterized by a diverse range of property types, each with its own legal status and rights. The two main categories of land ownership were """"ager publicus"""" and """"ager privatus."""" Ager publicus referred to public land owned by the state and subject to distribution among Roman citizens. Ager privatus, on the other hand, denoted private land owned by individuals or families.  Ownership of land in ancient Rome was intricately tied to its use and productivity. The concept of """"usucapio"""" was central to Roman property law, allowing individuals to acquire ownership of land through uninterrupted possession for a specified period. This principle aimed to promote the efficient use of land and prevent neglect or misuse.  Transferring land ownership in Rome involved various legal processes and terminology. One common method was """"mancipatio,"""" a formal ceremony involving the transfer of property rights through symbolic gestures and spoken words. Another method was """"in iure cessio,"""" where ownership rights were transferred through a legal proceeding before a magistrate.  Legal documents played a crucial role in documenting land ownership and transactions in ancient Rome. """"Tabulae"""" were inscribed tablets or documents used to record property boundaries, ownership details, and transactions. These records were essential for resolving disputes and establishing ownership rights.  Roman legal terminology related to land ownership included terms like """"dominium"""" (ownership rights), """"fundus"""" (landed property), """"praedium"""" (estate), and """"ager limitatus"""" (bounded land). Each term had specific legal implications and conveyed distinct aspects of land ownership and usage in Roman society.  The Roman legal system also recognized the concept of """"emphyteusis,"""" a long-term lease agreement granting rights to cultivate and benefit from land while retaining the ownership with the lessor. This arrangement facilitated agricultural development and land utilization, reflecting the importance of agricultural production in the Roman economy.  Disputes over land ownership were resolved through legal proceedings in Roman courts. The """"actio rei vindicatio"""" was a legal action allowing owners to claim their property rights against unauthorized possessors. Additionally, the """"actio negatoria"""" enabled property owners to defend their rights against nuisance or interference with their land.  Inheritance and succession laws were significant factors in Roman land ownership. The """"lex Falcidia"""" established limits on the amount of a testator's estate that could be bequeathed to non-heirs, ensuring a fair distribution of assets among family members. These laws aimed to preserve family wealth and property rights across generations.  Overall, Roman land ownership and legal terminology reflected the complex interplay between property rights, social structures, and legal principles in ancient Rome. The system of land ownership shaped the economic prosperity, social status, and political power of individuals and families, illustrating the enduring legacy of Roman law and civilization.""","638"
"Saint Simon Louis de Rouvroy duc de","""An officer of the guards was to accompany him until his departure: How this overruling order was received, and what the Cardinal did, I know not; I only know that he obeyed it, and took the road for Arragon. So few precautions had been taken, that he carried off an immense number of papers, money, and jewels; and it was not until a few days had elapsed, that the King of Spain was informed that the original will of Charles the Second could not be found. It was at once supposed that Alberoni had carried away this precious of. private misdeeds, which it was no longer thought necessary to hide. M. le Duc d'Orleans did not restrain his joy, still less the Abbe Dubois; it was their work which had overthrown their personal enemy; with him fell the wall of separation, so firmly erected by Alberoni between the Regent and the King of Spain; sole obstacle against peace. This last reason caused joy to burst out in Italy, in Vienna, in London; and peace between France, and Spain soon resulted. The allied princes felicitated themselves on what had happened; even the Dutch were ravished to be delivered of a minister so double-dealing, so impetuous, so powerful. M. le Duc d'Orleans dispatched the Chevalier de Morcieu, a very skilful and intelligent man, and certainly in the hands of the Abbe Dubois, to the extreme confines of the frontiers to wait for Alberoni, accompanying him until the moment of his embarkation in Provence for Italy; with orders never to lose sight of him, to make him avoid the large towns and principal places as much as possible; suffer no honours to be rendered to him; above all, to hinder him from communicating with anybody, or anybody with him; in a word, to conduct him civilly, like a prisoner under guard. Morcieu executed to the letter this disagreeable commission; all the more necessary, because, entirely disgraced as was Alberoni, everything was to be forced from him while traversing a great part of France, where all who were adverse to the Regent might have recourse to him. Therefore it was not without good reason that every kind of liberty was denied him. It may be imagined what was suffered by a man so impetuous, and so accustomed to unlimited power; but he succeeded in accommodating himself to such a great and sudden change of condition; in maintaining his self- possession; in subjecting himself to no refusals; in being sage and measured in his manners; very reserved in speech, with an air as though he cared for nothing; and in adapting himself to everything without questions, without pretension, without complaining, dissimulating everything, and untiringly pretending to regard Morcieu as an accompaniment of honour. He received, then, no sort of civility on the part of the Regent, of Dubois, or of anybody; and performed the day's journeys, arranged by Morcieu, without stopping, almost without suite, until he arrived on the shores of the Mediterranean, where he immediately embarked and passed to the Genoa coast. Alberoni, delivered of his Argus, and arrived in Italy, found himself in another trouble by the anger of the Emperor, who would suffer him nowhere, and by the indignation of the Court of Rome, which prevailed, on this occasion, over respect for the purple. Alberoni for a long time was forced to keep out of the way, hidden and a fugitive, and was not able to approach Rome until the death of the Pope. The remainder of the life of this most extraordinary man is not a subject for these memoirs. But what ought not to be forgotten is the last mark of rage, despair, and madness that he gave in traversing France. He wrote to M. le Duc d'Orleans, offering to supply him with the means of making a most dangerous war against Spain; and at Marseilles, ready to embark, he again wrote to reiterate the same offers, and press them on the Regent. I cannot refrain from commenting here upon the blindness of allowing ecclesiastics to meddle with public affairs; above all, cardinals, whose special privilege is immunity from everything most infamous and most degrading. Ingratitude, infidelity, revolt, felony, independence, are the chief characteristics of these eminent criminals. Of Alberoni's latter days I will say but a few words. At the death of Clement XI., legal proceedings that had been taken to deprive Alberoni of his cardinalship, came to an end. Wandering and hidden in Italy, he was summoned to attend a conclave for the purpose of electing a new Pope. Alberoni was the opprobrium of the sacred college; proceedings, as I have said, were in progress to deprive him of his cardinalship. The King and Queen of Spain evidently stimulated those proceedings: the Pope just dead had opposed him; but the cardinals would not agree to his disgrace; they would not consent to strip him of his dignity. The example would have been too dangerous. That a cardinal, prince, or great nobleman, should surrender his hat in order to marry, the store of his house demands it; well and good; but to see a cardinal deprive himself of his hat by way of penitence, is what his brethren will not endure. A cardinal may be poisoned, stabbed, got rid of altogether, but lose his dignity he never can. Rome must be infallible, or she is nothing. It was decided, that if, at the election of the new Pope, Alberoni were not admitted to take part in the proceedings, he always might protest against them, and declare them irregular. Therefore he was, as I have said, admitted to the conclave. He arrived in Rome, without display, in his own coach, and was received in the conclave with the same honours as all the other cardinals, and performed all the duties of his position. A few days after the election, he absented himself from Rome, as though to see whether proceedings would be continued against him. But they fell of themselves. The new Pope had no interest in them. The cardinals wished only for silence. Spain felt at last the inutility of her cries. Dubois was in favour of throwing a veil over his former crimes, so that, after a short absence, Alberoni hired in Rome a magnificent palace, and returned there for good, with the attendance, expense, and display his Spanish spoils supplied. He found himself face to face with the Cardinal Giudice, and with Madame des Ursins. The three formed a rare triangle, which caused many a singular scene in home. After seeing them both die, Alberoni became legate at Ferrara, continued there a long time, little esteemed at Rome, where he is now living, sound in mind and body, and eighty-six years of age. CIV The King attended the Royal Council for the first time on Sunday, the 8th of February, 720. He said nothing while there, or on going away, excepting that when M. le Duc d'Orleans, who feared he might grow weary of the proceedings, proposed to him to leave, he said he would stop to the end. After this he did not come always, but often, invariably remaining to the last, without moving or speaking. His presence changed nothing in the order of our arrangements, because his armchair was always there, alone, at the end of the table, and M. le Duc d'Orleans, whether his Majesty came or not, had but a 'stool' similar to those we all sat upon. Step by step this council had been so much increased, that now, by the entry of the Duc de Berwick, it numbered sixteen members! To say truth, we were far too many, and we had several among us who would have been much better away. I had tried, but in vain, to make the Regent see this. He did see at last, but it was too late; and meanwhile we were, as I have stated, sixteen in the council. I remember that one day, when the King came, a kitten followed him, and some time after jumped upon him, and thence upon the table, where it began to walk; the Duc de Noailles immediately crying out, because he did not like cats. M. le Duc d'Orleans wished to drive the animal away. I smiled, and said, 'Oh, leave the kitten alone, it will make the seventeenth.' M. le Duc d'Orleans burst out laughing at this, and looked at the company, who laughed also, the King as well. His Majesty briefly spoke of it to me on the morrow, as though appreciating the joke, which, by the way, immediately ran over all Paris. The Abbe Dubois still maintained his pernicious influence over the Regent, and still looked forward to a cardinalship as the reward of his scheming, his baseness, and his perfidy. In the meantime, the Archbishopric of Cambrai became vacant (by the death, at Rome, of the Cardinal Tremoille). That is to say, the richest archbishopric, and one of the best posts in the Church. The Abbe Dubois was only tonsured; 5/80,00 livres, a year tempted him, and perhaps this position, from which he could more easily elevate himself to the cardinalship. Impudent as he might be, powerful as might be the empire he had acquired over his master, he was much embarrassed, and masked his effrontery under a trick. He said to M. le Duc d'Orleans, he had a pleasant dream; and related to him that he had dreamt he was Archbishop of Cambrai!""","""Alberoni's political downfall and exile""","2048","""Giulio Alberoni, a prominent figure in European politics during the early 18th century, experienced a dramatic downfall and subsequent exile that marked the end of his influential career. This intriguing story unfolds against the backdrop of power struggles, shifting alliances, and the complexities of court politics in the era of absolute monarchies. Alberoni's rise to power, his ambitious aspirations, and ultimately his downfall offer a fascinating glimpse into the dynamics of political intrigue and the precarious nature of wielding influence in the corridors of power.  Born in 1664 in Italy, Alberoni began his career as a priest before transitioning into the realm of politics. His keen intellect, charm, and strategic acumen quickly propelled him to positions of authority. Alberoni's talents did not go unnoticed, and he eventually found himself serving as the Prime Minister of Spain under King Philip V in the early 18th century. During his time in office, Alberoni implemented bold and controversial reforms aimed at revitalizing Spain's economy, military, and international standing.  Alberoni's ambitious agenda included military interventions in Italy to expand Spanish influence, which drew the ire of other European powers wary of his growing influence. His actions sparked a series of conflicts and alliances that ultimately led to his downfall. Perhaps the most notable of these ventures was the so-called """"Quadruple Alliance"""" established in 1718, which aimed to contain Spanish expansionist ambitions in Italy. The alliance, composed of Britain, France, Austria, and the Dutch Republic, effectively isolated Spain and put Alberoni's position in jeopardy.  The turning point in Alberoni's career came in 1719 when his attempts to install Elisabeth Farnese's son as Duke of Parma and Piacenza, in opposition to the Quadruple Alliance's interests, resulted in a swift and decisive military intervention. The subsequent defeat of Spanish forces in Sicily and Sardinia dealt a fatal blow to Alberoni's standing, leading to his dismissal from office and exile from Spain. The once-powerful minister found himself stripped of authority and influence, a stark reminder of the fickle nature of politics.  Alberoni's exile marked the end of an era for a man who had once wielded immense power and influence. Forced to leave Spain, he sought refuge in Italy, where he lived out the remainder of his days in relative obscurity. The grand ambitions and schemes that had defined his political career now seemed like distant memories, overshadowed by the ignominy of his downfall. His legacy, once marked by bold reforms and audacious pursuits, was now tinged with the bitterness of defeat and exile.  Despite his dramatic downfall, Alberoni's legacy continues to fascinate historians and political observers. His meteoric rise to power, his daring initiatives, and his ultimate undoing serve as a cautionary tale about the perils of political hubris and overreach. Alberoni's story highlights the complexities of power dynamics, the fragility of alliances, and the inherent risks of challenging the established order.  In the annals of history, Alberoni remains a complex and enigmatic figure—a man of intellect and ambition whose reach ultimately exceeded his grasp. His downfall and exile serve as a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of political fortunes and the unforgiving nature of power dynamics. As we reflect on Alberoni's legacy, we are reminded of the enduring lessons that his story imparts about the complexities of leadership, the dangers of unchecked ambition, and the inexorable forces that shape the destinies of individuals and nations alike.  In conclusion, Alberoni's political downfall and exile represent a compelling saga of rise and fall, ambition and defeat. His story stands as a testament to the volatile nature of political power and the unpredictable twists of fate that can transform a figure of authority into a pariah. Through his tumultuous journey, Alberoni's life offers valuable insights into the intricate web of politics, power, and personal ambition that have shaped the course of history for centuries.""","812"
"Fosdick Harry Emerson","""There never will be any better goodness anywhere, and when the earth comes to its end in a solar catastrophe, there will be no goodness left at all. Certainly the hypothesis of no-God raises more questions than it easily can quell. Indeed the Christian, long accused by unbelieving friends of gross credulity because he holds his creed, may well leave his defense and 'go over the top' in an offensive charge. If it is a question of holding creeds, unbelief is a creed as certainly as belief is; it says, I believe that there is no God or that God cannot be known. If it is a question of credulity, the Christian suspects that of all the different kinds of credulousness which the world has seen, nothing ever has surpassed the capacity of modern sceptics to accept impossible beliefs. He who says, I believe that there is no God, nor anything which that name might reasonably connote, is saying, I believe that the fundamental reality everywhere is physical. Long ages ago atoms, electrons, 'mobile cosmic ethers' began their mysterious organization, whose present issue is planetary orbits, rocks, organic life, and, highest point of all, the brain of man. Man's mind is but the moving shadow cast by the activity of brain. Man's character is the subtle fragrance of his nerves. Everywhere, if the no-God hypothesis be true, spirit is a result, physical energy the cause. Some startling corollaries follow such a view. No man can be blamed for anything. Molecular action in the brain is responsible alike for saints and sinners, and we are as powerless to change our quality of character or action as a planet is to change its course. Judas and Jesus, Festus and Paul, the Belgian lads and the Prussian officers who mutilated them, the raper and the raped--why blame the one or praise the other when all characters alike are ground from a physical machine, whose action is predetermined by the push of universal energy behind? One man even says that to condemn an immoral deed is like Xerxes whipping the Hellespont--punishment visited on physical necessity which is not to blame. The second corollary is not less startling: every man thinks as he does because of molecular action in the brain. A Christian believes in God because his molecules maneuver so, and his opponent is an atheist because his molecules maneuver otherwise, and all convictions of truth, however well debated and reasoned out, are fundamentally the work of atoms, not of mind. What we call intellect as little causes anything as steam from a kettle causes the boiling out of which it comes. Some brains boil Socialism, some do not; some brains boil Episcopalianism and some Christian Science. A determinist and a believer in freewill differ as do oaks and elm trees, for physical reasons only, and folk are Catholic in southern Europe--so we are informed--because their skulls are narrow, and in northern Europe Protestants because their skulls are broad. Truth is a nickname for a neurosis. The standing marvel is that on some matters like the multiplication table our brains boil so unanimously. A third corollary still remains: we have no creative power of mind and will. All that is and is to be was wound up in primeval matter, and now in our thoughts and actions is ticking like a clock. 'All of our philosophy,' says Huxley, 'all our poetry, all our science, and all our art--Plato, Shakespeare, Newton, and Raphael--are potential in the fires of the sun.' That is to say, Plato had nothing to do with creating his philosophy, nor Shakespeare with writing plays--they were empty megaphones and the real voice is the physical machine from which all things come. Professor Bowne of Boston University, after the publication of his 'Metaphysics,' received from a physicist a protest against his emphasis on the reality of mind. The professor of physics insisted that the only fundamental reality was physical and that mind is always a result of brain's activity and never a cause of anything. To this Professor Bowne replied that according to the writer's own theory, as he understood it, the letter of protest was the result of certain physical forces issuing in nervous excitations that made scratches on paper, and that the writer's mind had nothing effectual to do with its composition. This, said Professor Bowne, might be a plausible explanation of the letter, but he was unwilling to apply it to the universe. What wonder that the physicist acknowledged to a friend that the retort nettled him, for he did not see just how to answer it? IV One's discontent with this reduction of our lives to physical causation is increased when he studies the mental process by which men reach it. It is as if a man should perceive in the works of Shakespeare insight and beauty, pathos and laughter, despair and hope, and should set himself to explain all these as the function of the type. How plausibly he could do it! If one takes Shakespeare's sentences full of spiritual meaning he can readily resolve them into twenty-six constituent letters of the alphabet, and these into certain hooks and dashes, and these into arithmetical points diffused in space. Starting with such abstract points, let one suppose that some fortunate day they arranged themselves into hooks and dashes, and these into letters of the alphabet, and these by fortuitous concourse came together into sentences. Reading them we think we see deep spiritual meaning, but they are all the work of type; the fundamental reality is arithmetical points diffused in space. Such is the process by which a man reduces the mental and moral life of man back to its physical basis; then breaks up the physical basis into atoms; then, starting with these abstractions, builds up again the whole world which he just has analyzed, and thinks he has explained the infinitely significant spiritual life of man. Not for a long time will we accept such a method of explaining the works of Shakespeare! Nor can man contentedly be made to follow so inconsequential a process of thought as that by which the mind and character of Jesus are reduced to a maneuver of molecules. The attractiveness of this explanation of the universe as a huge physical machine is easily understood. It presents a simple picture, readily grasped. It packs the whole explanation of the world into a neat parcel, portable by any mind. In the days of monarchy the government of the universe was pictured in terms of an absolute sovereign; in feudal times the divine economy was pictured as a gigantic feudalism; we always use a dominant factor in the life of man to help us picture the eternal. So in the age whose builder and maker is machinery we easily portray the universe as a huge machine. The process is simple and natural, but to suppose that it is adequate is preposterous. Lord Kelvin, the chemist, knew thoroughly the mechanistic idea of the world. He felt the fascination of it, for he said at Johns Hopkins University, 'I never satisfy myself until I make a mechanical model of a thing. If I can make a mechanical model I can understand it. As long as I cannot make a mechanical model all the way through, I cannot understand.' But Lord Kelvin knew better than to suppose that this figure comprehended all of reality. 'The atheistic idea,' said he, 'is so nonsensical, that I do not know how to put it into words.' The rejection of the no-God hypothesis does not necessarily imply that a man becomes fully Christian in his thought of deity. There are way-stations between no-God and Jesus' Father. But it does mean that to him reality must be fundamentally spiritual, not physical. What other hypothesis possibly can fit the facts? For consider the view of a growing universe which we see from the outlook that modern science furnishes. Out of a primeval chaos where physical forces snarled at each other in unrelieved antagonism, where no man had yet arisen to love truth and serve righteousness, something has brought us to a time, when for all our evil, there are mothers and music and the laughter of children at play, men who love honor and for service' sake lay down their lives, and homes in every obscure street where fortitude and sacrifice are splendidly exhibited. Out of a chaos, where a contemporary observer, could there have been one, would have seen no slightest promise of spirit, something has brought us to the Ten Commandments, and the Sermon on the Mount, to great character and growing achievements in social righteousness, to lofty thoughts of the Divine and hopes of life eternal. Something has been at work here besides matter. No explanation of all this will do, without God. V Another source of confirmation for the man who, valuing Christian experience, seeks assurance that it is intellectually justifiable, is to be found in the effect of Christian faith on life itself. The nautical tables can be proved by an astronomer in his observatory; but if they are given to a sailor and he beats about the seas with them in safety, finding that they make adventurous voyages practicable, that also would be important witness to their truth. So the Christian ideas of life have not been kept by studious recluses to ponder over and weave philosophies about; they have been down in the market place, men have been practically trying them for generations, and they make great living. The ultimate ground of practical assurance about anything is that we have tried it and that it works. A man may have experience that other persons exist, may draw the inference that friendly relations with them are not impossible, but only when he launches out and verifies his thought in an adventure will he really be convinced of friendship's glory. In no other way has final assurance about God come home to man. They who have lived as though God were have been convinced that he is; they who have willed to do his will have known.""","""Existence of God vs. Atheism""","2027","""The debate surrounding the existence of God versus atheism is one that has fascinated philosophers, theologians, scientists, and individuals alike for centuries. At the heart of this philosophical discourse lies the fundamental question of whether a divine being or higher power exists or whether the universe can be explained solely through natural phenomena. While both sides present compelling arguments to support their beliefs, the intricacies and complexities of this topic continue to challenge and provoke intellectual exploration and contemplation.  The concept of God, defined as an all-powerful, all-knowing, and benevolent entity responsible for the creation and maintenance of the universe, has been central to the beliefs of many religious traditions around the world. Proponents of the existence of God, often referred to as theists, assert that the complexity and orderliness of the universe, the existence of moral values and ideals, and personal religious experiences all point towards the presence of a divine being. The argument from design, also known as the teleological argument, posits that the intricate design and functionality of the natural world, from the complexity of DNA to the precision of the laws of physics, suggest the existence of an intelligent creator.  Furthermore, theists often draw upon personal religious experiences, such as feelings of transcendence, awe, and connection to a higher power, as evidence of the existence of God. These subjective encounters with the divine are seen as validating the existence of a spiritual realm beyond the physical world. Additionally, many religious traditions emphasize the presence of moral laws and values that are believed to originate from a higher source, which further reinforces the argument for the existence of a divine being who governs human behavior and ethics.  On the other side of the spectrum, atheists reject the notion of a supreme being or deity and instead advocate for a worldview based on empirical evidence, reason, and rationality. Atheism, often defined as the absence of belief in gods or supernatural entities, asserts that the burden of proof lies with those making the claim of the existence of God. Atheists argue that in the absence of conclusive empirical evidence or verifiable proof of a divine being, it is more reasonable to adopt a naturalistic worldview that relies on scientific explanations and critical thinking.  One of the central arguments put forth by atheists is the problem of evil, which questions how the existence of a benevolent and omnipotent God can be reconciled with the presence of suffering, injustice, and cruelty in the world. The prevalence of natural disasters, human atrocities, and personal hardships raises significant doubts about the existence of a loving and all-powerful deity who would allow such pain and suffering to exist. Atheists often argue that the existence of suffering and evil in the world is more compatible with a universe governed by natural laws and random chance rather than a divine plan orchestrated by a supernatural being.  Moreover, atheists critique the reliance on subjective religious experiences and anecdotes as evidence for the existence of God, pointing out that personal feelings and emotions are inherently subjective and can vary greatly among individuals and cultures. Instead, atheists advocate for a reliance on empirical evidence, rational inquiry, and the scientific method to gain a deeper understanding of the natural world and the origins of the universe. The progress of scientific discovery, from evolutionary biology to cosmology, has provided naturalistic explanations for many phenomena that were once attributed to divine intervention, further challenging traditional religious beliefs.  The ongoing debate between theists and atheists raises profound questions about the nature of existence, the origins of the universe, the purpose of life, and the role of morality and ethics. While both perspectives offer compelling arguments and insights, the search for truth and meaning continues to fuel intellectual discourse and philosophical inquiry on this complex and profound topic. The diversity of human beliefs and worldviews underscores the richness and complexity of the human experience, encouraging thoughtful reflection and dialogue on matters of faith, reason, and the mysteries of existence.""","767"
"Roberts Frederick Sleigh Roberts Earl","""I therefore insert in this place a statement of that position which I made in a speech delivered in the Mansion House in July last. As an introduction to that speech I may be permitted to quote from a statement which, as President of the League, I published in the Times in January, 912: 'It is not infrequently asserted that the League is hostile to the Territorials, that we have discouraged recruiting for them, and that, were our programme adopted, the Territorial Force would disappear. Nothing is further from the truth. From the date of its formation we have constantly praised the Territorial Force as an organization; we have again and again borne willing witness to the patriotism of those who joined its ranks. Thus in 908, Lord Milner, speaking at the annual dinner of the League on June 4, said: 'Let us hold up high the standard of efficiency for the Territorial army as we have got it, and let us back up those who have originated that army and who are trying to make the best of it; let us back them up in all their efforts to make it as like a real army in training and in equipment as it is possible to make it. That, I believe, is the proper course for us to pursue.' In our official statement issued in February, 909, these words occur: 'The National Service League has consistently given the warmest support to the Territorial Force from its inception, recognizing the great superiority in organization and capabilities that this Force provides as compared with the old Volunteer Force.' And, during the past year, in his volume, 'Fallacies and Facts,' the President of the League, whilst criticizing Lord Haldane's and Sir Ian Hamilton's deductions, allots the highest praise to the public spirit alike of employers and employees who support the Territorial movement. In addition to this, our members have actively helped the Territorial Force by working on the County Associations and by obtaining recruits. We are represented on the majority of the County Associations, and nearly one-fourth of the members of these Associations are also members of the National Service League. Again, many of our members are enrolled in the Territorials, and Lord Haldane himself, speaking at the headquarters of the th City of London Rifles on December, 911, said there were numbers of the National Service League who had assisted in the work of recruiting for the Territorial Force, and he 'took this opportunity of thanking them.' Moreover, it is to be observed that the whole programme of the National Service League is now based on the maintenance and expansion of the Territorial Force. Our programme, far from involving the disappearance of that Force, or of any part of that Force, accepts it in its entirety. All that it does is to change the system of recruiting, and thus enable the training to be given before and not after war breaks out. Were the League's proposals adopted, not a single unit of the Territorial Force would be reduced, nor a man called upon to leave its ranks. The whole organization and personnel would be preserved, and their services would be invaluable in bridging the difficult period of transition from the old system to the new. The Territorial Force would be increased to an adequate strength, made efficient as a military machine, and would rest on the firm basis of universal military training of the manhood of the nation, instead of--as at present--on insufficient service given with difficulty by a patriotic minority. The above, we trust, will be sufficient to dispose of the idea that there is, or ever has been, any antagonism on the part of the League towards the Territorial Force as a body. We contend that all able-bodied men should be trained in it. But, whilst we have from the beginning praised the organization of this Force, whilst we have admired the patriotism and self-sacrifice of those who have joined it, and encouraged our members to support it, we do not conceal our opinion that, resting as it does on voluntary enlistment alone, it can never become a Force on which the country can rely for its protection in time of peril. Every year that passes emphasizes the correctness of this view. The Territorial Force is in the fourth year of its existence, and, despite the large measure of support given to it and the unwearied labour of one of the ablest War Ministers we have ever had, what is its condition? Its strength in round numbers should be 14,00. It is 64,00. All its members should do fifteen days' drill in camp every year. Only 5/85/8,00 have done so this year. It should have 1,00 Territorial Officers. It has only,00. Finally, 0 officers and,03 men were absent from camp this year without leave. We ask any open-minded man whether a Force thus constituted is an army at all, much less an army to which this country can entrust its existence as a great Nation? We do not bring these facts forward in order to discredit Lord Haldane's courageous efforts or to depreciate the patriotism of those now serving in the Force. We bring them forward simply in order to demonstrate the impossibility of constructing a defensive Army equal to this country's needs on a basis of voluntary enlistment. If Lord Haldane, backed by the hearty support of King and country, has failed--and by his own admission he has failed--who is likely to succeed? Not many weeks ago this country was on the verge of a gigantic war. And it was a war which, if it had come, would have come unexpectedly and suddenly. What would have been our position? All the soothing fallacies which pass current in time of peace--the belief that our Expeditionary Force can at the same time be sent abroad and yet kept at home to cover the training of the Territorial Force; the belief that this Force is sure of six months' unmolested leisure in which it can fit itself for the serious business of war--would have been shattered in twelve hours. The Expeditionary Force--to be of any use at all--must have been despatched abroad without a day's delay; and, for the defence of these islands, we should have had to rely upon a handful of Regulars left behind in the depots as 'unfit'; such of the Special Reserve as may not be required for the Expeditionary Force, and the National Reserve; but mainly upon a Territorial Force, nominally 64,00 strong, untrained for war, and further weakened by a shortage of,00 officers! Now, making every allowance for the immense resisting power which in moments of supreme peril nations and cities have occasionally derived from enthusiasm or despair, is it either fitting, we ask, or even prudent, that, in the twentieth century, Great Britain should repose her trust in so problematical and hazardous a presumption? For the transformation of the most heroic enthusiasm into an effective weapon of war demands time, exactly as the transformation of the Territorials into an efficient Army demands time. But when war comes it will come with great suddenness; the essential crisis will be on us in an instant, and for Great Britain--as Lord Salisbury in his latest utterances significantly warned us--the stake is not to be reckoned in millions of a war indemnity; the stake is our very existence as an Empire. When Lord Haldane cites the exploits of untrained or semi-trained forces, when he speaks of 'a whole nation springing to arms at the call of duty,' he has his eyes fastened upon other circumstances and upon other times than ours. Under the conditions of modern war, discipline alone can confront discipline on a field of battle. 'We appeal to our countrymen to join us in our effort,' I went on to say. 'We appeal, above all, to the officers and men of the existing Territorial Force. We are working to insure that their sacrifice to patriotism should not be made futile, nor their devotion thrown away. We are working to make the Army to which they belong a reality--that is to say, a Home Army efficient and sufficient; an Army which shall always be ready to take up the defence of these islands, and leave our Regulars free and our Fleets free to fight our battles elsewhere. We ask them to assist us in our efforts to introduce a system of compulsory training, the only system under which the safety of the country can be secured and the Territorial Force made really effective.' On June 7, 908, said: 'In the event of a great war breaking out. the Territorials would be embodied, not for immediate fighting, if it could be avoided, but for their war training.' THE LORD 'S Speech delivered in the Mansion House, July 2, 912. MY LORD, MY, AND, It is seven years, almost to the day, since I had the honour of addressing a meeting of City men in this historic House on the subject of Imperial Defence. On that occasion I prefaced my remarks by saying: 'I have but one object in coming before you to-day, namely, to bring home to my fellow-countrymen the vital necessity of their taking into their earnest consideration our unpreparedness for war.' I then affirmed that the armed forces of this country were as absolutely unfitted and unprepared for war as they were in 899-900. And, my Lords and gentlemen, I grieve to have this afternoon to repeat to you that we are now scarcely better fitted or better prepared to carry on a war to-day than in 905/8. The experience that we gained in the Boer War has had little effect upon our general military policy. We have neglected, except as regards the Regular Army, to profit by the lessons which that war ought to have taught us. What are the causes of this indifference and this deep-seated apathy? The causes, I think, are not far to seek.""","""National Service and Territorial Force""","2039","""National Service, also known as mandatory military service or compulsory national duty, is a policy implemented by many countries around the world to involve citizens in a period of service to their nation. This concept has been utilized in various forms and for different reasons throughout history, shaping the social fabric and security of nations. The Territorial Force, on the other hand, refers to a reserve force composed of civilians who are trained and organized to support the regular armed forces during times of need. Both National Service and the Territorial Force play essential roles in maintaining a country's defense capabilities, fostering a sense of national identity, and promoting unity among citizens.  National Service is often seen as a way to instill discipline, patriotism, and a sense of responsibility in young citizens. By requiring individuals to undergo military training and serve their country for a specified period, governments aim to cultivate a spirit of duty and sacrifice among their population. This experience can also help individuals develop important skills such as leadership, teamwork, and resilience, which can benefit them in their future endeavors. Moreover, National Service fosters a sense of unity and common purpose among diverse groups within society, breaking down barriers and building bridges between different communities.  Countries that implement National Service often cite national security as a primary reason for the policy. By having a pool of trained personnel who can be mobilized in times of crisis or conflict, nations can enhance their defense capabilities and ensure the protection of their citizens. National Service provides a steady supply of manpower for the armed forces, reducing the reliance on costly professional military forces and enabling a broader participation in national defense efforts. In some cases, National Service programs also contribute to nation-building by integrating individuals from different backgrounds and regions into a unified force dedicated to safeguarding the country's interests.  The Territorial Force complements National Service by serving as a reserve component that can be called upon to support regular military operations. Composed of individuals who have completed their mandatory service or volunteers who wish to contribute to national defense, the Territorial Force provides a crucial backup during emergencies, natural disasters, or other situations where additional personnel are needed. These reservists undergo training and maintain readiness to swiftly mobilize and reinforce the regular armed forces, ensuring a rapid response to threats or contingencies.  In addition to its military functions, the Territorial Force plays a significant role in promoting community resilience and civil-military cooperation. Reservists often have civilian jobs and responsibilities, allowing them to bring diverse skills and experiences to their military service. This integration of civilian and military life enables the Territorial Force to bridge the gap between the armed forces and society, fostering greater understanding and collaboration between the military and the civilian population. Reservists also serve as ambassadors for the military, promoting positive perceptions of defense forces within their communities.  Both National Service and the Territorial Force have evolved over time to adapt to changing security environments and societal norms. Some countries have transitioned from compulsory military service to volunteer-based systems, while others have maintained a combination of mandatory and reserve components. The effectiveness of these programs depends on various factors, including the duration of service, the quality of training, the integration of reservists into regular military units, and the level of public support for national defense policies.  Critics of National Service argue that mandatory conscription infringes on individual freedoms and may not be necessary in peacetime. They raise concerns about the impact of compulsory military service on education, employment, and personal development, suggesting that alternative forms of national engagement, such as voluntary service programs, could achieve similar objectives without the coercive element. Advocates of National Service, however, contend that the benefits of instilling civic values, fostering national unity, and enhancing defense capabilities outweigh the potential drawbacks, especially in countries facing security challenges or seeking to build a strong sense of shared identity among citizens.  Overall, National Service and the Territorial Force represent important components of a nation's defense strategy and social cohesion. By engaging citizens in the defense of their country, these programs contribute to the resilience, unity, and preparedness of society as a whole. Whether through mandatory service or volunteer participation, the commitment to national duty reflects a deep-seated belief in the collective responsibility of individuals to safeguard the welfare and security of their nation. As the global security landscape continues to evolve, the roles and relevance of National Service and the Territorial Force will remain vital in shaping the future of defense and citizenship in countries across the world.""","892"

No. 9725/8.--Centerville beach, California; tooth quite irregular in form, but the portion above the rugose base or root conical. Inner surface flat and uneven. Outer surface convex and rather rugose. The cement covers the whole tooth thickly to within about mm. of the apex, which latter is short, quite acute, and slightly directed inward. It is convex externally and nearly flat internally. The basal rugosity or root is conical, thicker than the rest of the tooth, and unsymmetrical, being somewhat directed backward. It shows no opening below. When in the natural position this tooth is strongly inclined forward and outward, and only the tip for a length of 2 mm. protrudes beyond the alveolus. (Pl. 9, fig..) No. 9726.--St. George Island, Alaska; female, adult. Anterior tooth conical, with the tip blunt, having been so much abraded that the dentine does not extend beyond the coating of cement. The tip measures 6 by 9 mm. The external and internal surfaces of the tooth are about equally convex and somewhat rugose without distinct furrows. The root is thicker than the remainder of the tooth and very rugose. It is entirely closed below, and the inferior outline is convex. Posterior tooth much compressed, conical above the root, nearly flat internally and slightly convex externally. Cement coating very thick and extending to within about mm. of the dentine apex, which latter is acute and very slightly curved inward and backward. The root is very unsymmetrical, the posterior portion being much longer than the anterior. The surface is very rugose, and there is no opening whatever below. The inferior border is convex, with an emargination near the center. (Pl. 9, figs.,.) In the adult skull from Bering Island, which has been mounted and placed on exhibition, the teeth are fixed in the alveoli so that their entire length and the peculiarities of the basal portion can not be determined. In general form, however, they resemble those of the preceding specimen very closely. The anterior teeth are placed obliquely--that is, so that the anterior margins of the two teeth are nearer together than the posterior margins. The teeth are also somewhat inclined forward. The posterior teeth are strongly inclined forward and a little outward. The anterior teeth are rather concave along the middle internally and convex externally. The portion above the alveoli is quite smooth. The posterior teeth are moderately rugose above the alveoli. The whitish tips of denture are conical, compressed, and rather acute. They extend mm. above the denture, and are 1 mm. long at their base, and mm. thick. The anterior teeth protrude about 5/8 mm. above the from 0 to 4 mm. long and from 8 to 0 mm. thick. These teeth have an antero-external angular enlargement of the cement, so that they are somewhat triangular in horizontal section. (Pl. 0, fig.; pl. 1, fig..) The data available are insufficient to enable one to determine satisfactorily whether the teeth differ materially in size in the two sexes, but it appears probable that they do not.. While the skeleton of Berardius that of B. arnuxii very closely in most particulars, it presents differences which may properly be regarded as specific. The vertebral formula of B. arnuxii as given by Flower is as follows: C., Th. 0, L. 2, Ca. 9 = 8. The same formula is given for another specimen of B. arnuxii by Van Beneden and Gervais, except that the caudals are 7, two being apparently lacking. Doctor Hector, however, gives a different formula for a third specimen of this species, namely, C., Th. 0, L. 3, Ca. 7 = 7. He remarks that 'extreme care was taken to secure the whole of the small tail bones.' The discrepancy here shown can not be accounted for at present, but, at all events, none of the formulas of B. arnuxii corresponds to that of B. bairdii, as derived from the three skeletons in the National Museum, namely, C., Th. 1, L. 2, Ca. 6+ = 6+. The number of thoracic vertebr can be determined positively from the youngish male from St. George B. arnuxii the ninth thoracic has a very distinct transverse process on the side of the centrum, while in B. bairdii the ninth thoracic has a short, slender process attached to the side of the metapophysis and no facet at the posterior end of the centrum. (Pl. 2, fig..) In B. arnuxii the tenth thoracic is the second one having a distinct transverse process, and the latter is broad distally and has the articular facet on the posterior portion of the free margin. In B. bairdii the tenth thoracic is the first having a distinct transverse process on the side of the centrum. (Pl. 2, fig..) There are only ten thoracics in B. arnuxii, as already mentioned, but in B. bairdii there are eleven, and the eleventh is that which bears the second transverse process on the side of the centrum. The foregoing differences amount to this: That in B. bairdii the commencement of the lower series of transverse processes is pushed back one vertebra, as compared with B. arnuxii, and that in the ninth thoracic of the former species, which corresponds to the eighth of the latter species, the metapophysis has a short process on the side for the articulation of the tubercle of the rib, instead of merely a sessile facet. Although in other genera of ziphioids these differences would perhaps be looked upon as individual, since they are constant here they may be considered specific, at least provisionally.. In B. bairdii the anterior border of the scapula is narrower than in B. arnuxii, the anterior ridge coming close to it and lying parallel with it. The acromion is directed more upward, so that the angle between it and the body of the scapula is more acute, and the process itself is rather more expanded distally. The coronoid is inclined a little more downward. The whole surface of the scapula is very uneven.

The teeth of marine mammals exhibit a wide range of specialized features that reflect their diet, feeding behavior, and evolutionary history. From the sharp teeth of dolphins to the filter-feeding baleen of whales, the diversity of dental structures in marine mammals is a testament to their remarkable adaptation to life in the oceans.  One of the key aspects of dental morphology in marine mammals is the variation in tooth shape and structure. Tooth morphology is closely linked to the feeding habits of different species. For example, toothed whales such as dolphins and killer whales have conical-shaped teeth that are well-suited for catching and grasping prey. These teeth are typically sharp and pointed, enabling these predators to efficiently capture and consume fish, squid, and other marine animals.  In contrast, baleen whales possess baleen plates instead of teeth. Baleen is a unique filtering structure made of keratin that hangs from the upper jaws of these whales. Baleen whales, such as humpback whales and blue whales, use their baleen plates to filter small fish, krill, and plankton from the water. This specialization in dental morphology allows baleen whales to feed effectively on vast quantities of small prey while swimming through the water with their mouths open.  The evolution of baleen in whales is a fascinating example of how dental morphology can undergo significant changes in response to shifts in feeding behavior. Fossil evidence indicates that early whales had teeth similar to those of their land-dwelling ancestors. Over time, as these whales transitioned to a marine lifestyle and adopted filter-feeding strategies, their teeth were gradually replaced by baleen, a transformation that highlights the adaptive nature of dental structures in marine mammals.  Another intriguing aspect of dental morphology in marine mammals is the phenomenon of dental reduction or loss. Some species, such as dugongs and manatees, have continuously growing teeth that are used for grazing on sea grasses. These herbivorous marine mammals have adapted to a diet that requires them to continuously wear down their teeth through feeding. This unique dental adaptation ensures that their teeth remain functional despite the constant wear and tear associated with their feeding habits.  In addition to shape and structure, the arrangement of teeth within the jaw also varies among different marine mammal species. Toothed whales typically have teeth in both their upper and lower jaws, with variations in the number and shape of teeth depending on their dietary preferences. For example, sperm whales have a single row of large conical teeth in their lower jaw, which are used for hunting deep-sea squid. In contrast, dolphins have multiple rows of sharp, interlocking teeth in both jaws, allowing them to catch and hold onto fast-moving prey.  The dental formula, which represents the number and types of teeth in each half of the upper and lower jaws, provides valuable information about the dentition of marine mammals. By examining the dental formula of different species, researchers can gain insights into their evolutionary history, dietary preferences, and ecological roles within marine ecosystems. The diversity of dental formulas among marine mammals reflects the wide range of feeding strategies and niches occupied by these fascinating animals.  Furthermore, the enamel microstructure of teeth in marine mammals offers additional insights into their evolutionary relationships and ecological adaptations. By studying the microscopic features of tooth enamel, scientists can infer information about the growth patterns, diet specialization, and environmental changes experienced by marine mammals over time. This interdisciplinary approach combining dental morphology with paleontological and ecological data provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary processes that have shaped the dentition of marine mammals.  In conclusion, the study of dental morphology in marine mammals reveals the remarkable adaptations of these animals to their aquatic environment. From the specialized teeth of toothed whales for capturing prey to the baleen plates of filter-feeding whales for sieving food from the water, the diverse dental structures of marine mammals reflect their evolutionary history and ecological interactions. By examining the shape, structure, arrangement, and microstructure of teeth, researchers can unravel the intricate evolutionary stories encoded in the dentition of marine mammals, shedding light on their extraordinary diversity and complexity as denizens of the sea.""","851"
"Hough P M ","""As they strain at the rope the work seems extremely hard, but the people themselves appear unconscious of any hardship or inequality in the distribution of labour. The barge is in the first place a conveyance. The whole of the front part of the boat represents the hold in which the cargo is placed. This is generally represented by cheese or vegetables, timber, peat, and stones, the last-named being a return-cargo for the repairing of dykes and the construction of quays. But in the second place it is a house or place of residence, and the stern of the boat is given up for that purpose. The living room is the raised deck or poop, on which is not only the tiller, but the cooking-stove. The sleeping-room forms the one covered-in apartment. It is easily divisible into two by a temporary or removable partition, and it always possesses the two little windows, one on each side of the tiller, which give it so great a resemblance to a doll's house. This resemblance is certainly heightened by the custom of colouring the barges, which are always painted a bright colour, red or green being perhaps the most usual. As ornament there is usually a good deal of brasswork; the handle of the tiller is generally bordered with the metal, and the owner seems to take pride in nailing brass along the bulwarks of his boat where it is not wanted and is even little seen. It has been suggested that the polishing of these brass plates or bars provides a pleasant change from the dull routine work of towing. The brightness of the paint and the brasswork constitutes the pride of the barge-owners, and supplies a standard of comparison among them. To increase the homelike aspect of this water residence, birds and plants, always in more or less quantity and variety, are to be seen either in the windows or on the deck. The poorest bargee, which generally means the youngest or the beginner, will have one song-bird in a gilt cage, and as he accumulates money in his really profitable calling, he will add to his collection of birds a row of flowers and bulbs in pots. Thus he says, with a glow of satisfaction, 'I possess an aviary and a garden, like my cousin Hans on the polders, although my home is on the moving waters.' To strengthen the illusion what does he do but fix a toy gate on the poop above his sleeping-cabin, and thus cherishes the belief that he is on his own domain? In the evening, when the towing is over for the day, the women bring out their sewing, the children play round the tiller, and the good man smokes his immense pipe with complete and indolent satisfaction. And so day passes on to day without a variation, and life runs by without a ripple or a murmur for the canal population, while the mere landsmen look on with envy at what seems to them an idyllic existence, and even ladies of breeding and high station have been known to declare that they would gladly change places with the mistress of the bargee's quarter-deck. That was no doubt in the days before women had to take on themselves the brunt and burden of the towing. But even for the canal population of Holland the halcyon days are past. The spirit of reform is in the air. It may not be long before the tjalk, with its doll's house and its residential population, will finally disappear, and leave the canals of Holland as dull and colourless as the inland waters of any other country. The reform seems likely to come about in this way. There are at least 0,00 children resident on the canal-boats. How are they to be properly educated and brought up as useful citizens if they are to continue to lead a migratory existence which never leaves them for a fortnight in a single place? Formerly, nobody cared whether they were educated or not. They were left undisturbed to live their lives in their own simple and primitive way. As De Amicis wrote: 'The children are born and grow up on the water; the boat carries all their small belongings, their domestic affections, their past, their present, and their future. They labour and save, and after many years they buy a larger boat, selling the old one to a family poorer than themselves, or handing it over to the eldest son, who in his turn instals his wife, taken from another boat, and seen for the first time in a chance meeting on the canal.' But now the State has begun to interest itself in the children, and its intervention threatens to put a rude and summary ending to the system of heredity and exclusion which has kept the canal population a class apart. For some time past schools have been in existence, especially devoted to the education of the barge children, and whenever the barges are moored in harbour the children are expected to attend them. But these periods of halting are very brief and uncertain. The stationary barge earns no money, and it may even be that the parents evade the law as far as possible for fear of seeing their children acquire a distaste for the life in which they have been brought up. But the Government, having taken one step in the matter, cannot afford to go back, and it must also have definite satisfactory results to show for its legislation. The tentative measure of temporary schools along the canals has not leavened the illiteracy of the canal population. It will, therefore, become necessary at no great interval to devise some fresh and drastic regulations. Compulsory attendance at school for nine months of the year, which now applies to children in normal circumstances, may not be the lot of the barge children for some time, but when it comes, as it inevitably will one day, it will of necessity mean the break-up of the home life on the canals, for the children will have to be left behind during the almost unceasing voyages, and a place of residence will have to be provided on land. Where the children are the women will soon be, and gradually this place of residence will become the home, displacing the barge in the associations and affections of the canal population. Whether these changes will benefit those most affected by them cannot be guaranteed, but at least they will put an end to the separate existence of the canal population. When this result has been compassed by the inexorable progress of education and knowledge, the gradual disappearance of the canal population, the class of hereditary bargees as we have known it, and as it still exists, may be expected to follow at no remote date, for it was based on the enforcement of the family principle, and on the devotion of a whole community, from its youngest to its eldest member, to its maintenance. As it is the tow-barge is something of an anachronism, but the withdrawal of the youthful recruits, whose up-bringing alone rendered it possible, will entail its inevitable extinction. The decay and break-up of the guild of tjalk owners will be hastened by the introduction of steam and electricity as means of locomotion. The canals will lose the bright-coloured barges which are to-day their most striking feature, and the population that has so long floated over their surface. Life will be duller and more monotonous. The canal population, so long distinct, will be merged in the rest of the community. The tug will displace the tow-rope. The pullers will be housed on land, mastering the three R's instead of learning to strain at the girth. But there is still a brief period left during which the canal population may be seen in its original primitive existence, devoted to the barge, which is the only home known to six or seven thousand families, and traversing the water roads of their country in unceasing and endless progression. There is nothing like it in any other country of Europe. Venice has its water routes, but the gondola is not a domicile. There was a canal population in England, but, like much else in our modern life, it has lost whatever picturesqueness it might once have claimed. For a true canal population, bright and happy, living the same life from father to son and generation to generation, we must go to Holland. There these inland navigators ply their vocation with only one ambition, and that to become the owner of a tjalk, and to rear thereon a family of towers. It is said that the life is one that requires the consumption of unlimited quantitics of 'schnapps,' and the humidity of the atmosphere is undoubted. But even free libations do not diminish the prosperity of the bargees. They are a thriving race, and it must also be noted to their credit that they are well behaved, and not given to quarrels. Collisions on the thickly-covered canals are rare; malicious collisions are unknown. The barges pass and repass without hindrance, the tow-ropes never get entangled, there is mutual forbearance, and the skill derived from long experience in slipping the ropes uncler the barges does the rest. The conditions under which the canal population exists and thrives are a survival of an older order of things. When they disappear another of the few picturesque heritages of medival life will have been removecl from the hurly-burly and fierce competition of modern existence. Chapter VII A Dutch Village Villages in Holland are towns in miniature, for the simple reason that when you have a marsh to live in you drain a part of it and build on that part, and so build in streets, and do not form a village as in England, by houses dotted here and there round a green or down leafy lanes. The village green in Holland is the village street or square in front of the church or 'Raadhuis.' Here the children play, for you cannot play in a swamp, and that is what polder land is seven months out of the year, and so we find that a Dutch village in most parts of the country is a town in miniature.""","""Canal population and barge life""","2074","""Canals have played a significant role throughout history in shaping the development of civilizations, facilitating trade, and providing a unique way of life for those living and working along their banks. The population living in close proximity to canals, often referred to as canal towns, has a distinct culture and lifestyle influenced by the presence of these man-made waterways. Moreover, the barge life, where people live and work on barges navigating the canals, offers a fascinating glimpse into a world characterized by simplicity, community, and a deep connection to the water.  Canals have been vital lifelines for many communities, serving as key transportation arteries for the movement of goods, people, and ideas. The population living near canals has historically been closely linked to the economic activities supported by the waterway. Canal towns often sprung up along the banks, serving as hubs for trade, commerce, and industry. These towns would attract a diverse population including traders, artisans, and workers involved in canal maintenance and operation. Over time, canal towns developed their own vibrant culture, architecture, and traditions, shaped by the unique environment created by the presence of the waterway.  One of the most captivating aspects of canal life is the barge communities that have thrived along these waterways. Barges are flat-bottomed boats designed for transporting goods, and in some cases, served as homes for families navigating the canals. Barge life is characterized by simplicity and a deep connection to nature. Living on a barge means being intimately attuned to the rhythms of the water, the changing landscapes along the canal banks, and the close-knit community of fellow barge dwellers.  Life on a barge involves navigating the canals, operating locks, and interacting with other boaters and canal residents. The barge community is known for its camaraderie and mutual support, with boaters often assisting each other in navigating challenging stretches of the canal or sharing resources and knowledge about the waterway. Barge dwellers develop a unique bond with their floating homes, customizing them to suit their needs and creating cozy living spaces where every inch is maximized for efficiency and comfort.  For those living on barges, the canal becomes not just a transportation route but a way of life. The slow pace of travel along the water allows for a deep appreciation of the surrounding natural beauty, with opportunities for fishing, birdwatching, and enjoying peaceful moments surrounded by water and greenery. Barge dwellers often develop a keen understanding of the ecology of the canal, observing changes in water quality, plant life, and wildlife as they journey along the waterway.  Barge life also presents challenges, such as navigating through narrow canals, dealing with inclement weather, and managing limited resources onboard. However, these challenges are often outweighed by the sense of freedom, self-reliance, and adventure that come with living on a barge. Many barge dwellers choose this lifestyle for its simplicity and sense of community, finding fulfillment in being close to nature and living a more sustainable, low-impact existence.  In conclusion, the population living near canals and the barge communities that navigate these waterways embody a unique way of life shaped by the presence of these historic transportation routes. Canal towns have thrived as centers of commerce and culture, while barge life offers a glimpse into a world where simplicity, community, and a deep connection to nature are cherished values. Whether on land or water, the people associated with canals continue to enrich our understanding of the intersections between human habitation and the natural environment.""","717"
"Flickinger Roy C  Roy Caston ","""After Aeschylus the four pieces in a didascalia were usually unrelated in subject. According to canonical doctrine satyric drama was the intermediate stage in the development of tragedy from the dithyramb and was retained in the festival program as a survival. Within recent years, as this hypothesis has been subjected to searching criticism, its supports have slowly crumbled away. My own opinion is that tragedy and the satyr-play are independent offshoots of the the writers of satyr-plays arbitrarily superimposed Silenus and a chorus of satyrs upon some non-Dionysiac subject. Both in Euripides Cyclops and in Sophocles Trackers, the sole extant representatives of the genre, the Bacchic element is restricted to these followers of his, and Dionysus himself figures only as he is apostrophized or mentioned by them. In 38 B.C. Euripides introduced a further innovation by bringing out the Alcestis as the last play in his didascalia. Neither Silenus nor the chorus of satyrs appears in this piece, the theme being entirely non-Dionysiac; but the drunkenness of Heracles and the brutal frankness in the quarrel between Admetus and his father suggest the spirit of the old satyric drama, while the happy ending and the humor remind us of a comedy. These incongruities and the exceptionable circumstances under which the play was produced have occasioned the controversy, which began in antiquity and still continues, as to how the Alcestis is to be classified as a literary type. Is it a tragedy, comedy, satyr-play, tragi-comedy, melodrama, Schauspiel, Tendenz-Schrift, or what? How far Euripides innovation in substituting such a play for the usual satyric drama may have met with the approval and emulation of his fellow-playwrights we have no means of knowing; but an extant inscription of a century later shows that the satyr-play had then been degraded still poet always knew what kind of a play he was supposed to write. Of course, this is not the same as saying that all Greek tragedies were alike or that all Greek comedies seemed to be poured from the same mold. Within the type there was room for the greatest diversity, but the types did not overlap or borrow much from one another. This practice was a natural outgrowth of the Greek love for schematizing which displayed itself in the formulation and observance of rigid laws in every branch of art and especially in literature; in the field of drama this tendency was strengthened by the festival arrangements. Contrast with this the modern confusion of all the arts and all the literary genres which, in the sphere of drama, results in plays harder to classify than Polonius tragical-comical-historical-pastorals. This is one of the things that Voltaire had in mind when he declared that Shakespeare wrote like a drunken savage. The simplicity of the Greek effect is aptly characterized by Mr. Clayton Hamilton: Although the ancient drama frequently violated the three unities of action, time, and place, it always preserved a fourth unity, which we may call unity of mood. Possibly regard for this fourth unity caused Euripides to employ the deus ex machina at the conclusion of his Iphigenia among the Taurians. It is well known that this is the play that lends least support to the frequent charge that Euripides used the deus to cut the inextricable tangle of his plots. Here the final, insurmountable difficulty is of the poets own choosing. Orestes and his party have at last got their vessel free of the shore, and all the playwright needed to do was to allow them to sail on in safety and thus bring his play to a close. But arbitrarily he causes a contrary wind and sea to drive their ship back to land, making divine intervention indispensable. Of course this device enabled him to overleap the unity of time and bring events far in the future within the limits of his dramatic day, and frequently that was all that Euripides had in mind in having recourse to this artifice (see p. 95/8, below). But in the present instance I think he had an additional motive, one which has a place in this discussion. The gist of the matter is well expressed by Mr. Prickard: If the fugitives had simply escaped, snapping their fingers at Thoas, the ending would have been essentially comic: perhaps, after the grave and pathetic scenes which have gone before, we should rather call it burlesque. But the appearance of the deus ex machina, a device not itself to be praised, enables the piece to be finished after all with dignity and elevation of feeling. In connection with the foregoing arises another point: when the line between tragedy and comedy was drawn so sharply, we should hardly expect to find the writer of tragedies and the writer of comedies united in one and the same person. As a matter of fact not a single case is known in all Greek drama. The sock and buskin were not worn by the same poet; the Greek theater knew no Shakespeare. This very versatility of the Elizabethan poet helps to explain why his tragedies contain much that is humorous and his comedies much that is painful, a characteristic which has been so offensive to his French critics. Very similar is the situation among the actors. At the City Dionysia, beginning with 49 B.C., a prize was awarded to the best actor in the tragedies brought out each year, and about 25/8 B.C. a contest was established for comic actors. At the Lenaea, prizes were offered for comic and for tragic actors from about 42 B.C. and about 33 B.C., respectively. These arrangements would tend still further to keep each actor within his specialty. No performer in both tragic and comic roles is indubitably known until Praxiteles, who performed at Delphi in 06 B.C. as a comedian and nine years later as a tragedian. Two other instances occurred a little later. In the second century B.C. Thymoteles seems to have been both a tragic poet and a comic actor.""","""Greek Theater: Tragedy and Comedy""","1276","""Greek theater, with its origins dating back to the 5th century BC, is renowned for its enduring impact on Western drama. Divided into two main genres - tragedy and comedy - Greek theater served as a medium through which society reflected upon and made sense of the human experience. Tragedy and comedy were not merely forms of entertainment, but rather vehicles for exploring profound themes, engaging with morality, and questioning the nature of existence itself.  Tragedy, perhaps the more renowned of the two genres, delved into serious and weighty subjects, exploring the depths of human suffering, fate, and moral dilemmas. Playwrights such as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides crafted tragedies that often revolved around legendary figures from Greek mythology or history, examining their flaws, hubris, and inevitable downfalls. Central to Greek tragedy was the concept of catharsis - the purging of emotions such as pity and fear through witnessing the protagonist's tragic fate. This emotional release was believed to cleanse the audience and evoke a sense of moral introspection.  One of the most famous Greek tragedies is Sophocles' """"Oedipus Rex,"""" which follows the tragic story of Oedipus, a man unknowingly destined to kill his father and marry his mother. Themes of fate, free will, and the limits of human knowledge are explored, culminating in a powerful examination of the consequences of one's actions. Tragedy, with its focus on human suffering and the inexorable workings of fate, emphasized the fragility of human existence and the inevitability of our mortality.  In contrast to tragedy, comedy in Greek theater offered lighthearted and often satirical reflections on contemporary society, politics, and human nature. Playwrights like Aristophanes used comedy to entertain and provoke audiences, employing humor, parody, and witty wordplay to critique societal norms and individuals in power. Greek comedy frequently featured exaggerated characters, absurd situations, and bawdy humor, providing a release valve for societal tensions and a platform for social commentary.  Aristophanes' """"Lysistrata"""" is a classic example of Greek comedy, showcasing the story of women who go on a sex strike to end the ongoing Peloponnesian War. Through humor and irreverence, the play addresses themes of gender dynamics, war, and politics, challenging conventional power structures and societal norms. Greek comedy, with its irreverent spirit and social critique, offered a counterbalance to the seriousness of tragedy, allowing audiences to laugh at themselves and the world around them.  Both tragedy and comedy in Greek theater were performed in outdoor amphitheaters, such as the iconic Theater of Dionysus in Athens. Actors, all male and wearing masks to portray different characters, engaged with the chorus - a group of performers who provided commentary, reflection, and context to the unfolding drama. The audience, consisting of citizens from all walks of life, gathered to witness these theatrical spectacles during religious festivals honoring Dionysus, the god of wine and theater.  Greek theater, with its elaborate costumes, masks, and poetic language, was a collaborative art form that brought together playwrights, actors, chorus members, and the audience in a shared exploration of the human condition. The enduring legacy of Greek theater can be seen in its influence on later playwrights such as Shakespeare and modern-day theater practices. Tragedy and comedy, with their enduring themes and universal relevance, continue to resonate with audiences around the world, reminding us of the power of storytelling to provoke thought, evoke emotion, and illuminate the complexities of the human experience.  In conclusion, Greek theater's dual genres of tragedy and comedy exemplify the depth and breadth of human storytelling. Tragedy's exploration of suffering, fate, and morality alongside comedy's satire, humor, and social critique create a rich tapestry of theatrical expression. Through the interplay of these genres, Greek theater not only entertained audiences but also provided a mirror to society, reflecting its virtues, vices, and eternal struggles. The enduring legacy of Greek theater serves as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and its ability to transcend time and resonate across cultures.""","843"
"Dibblee George Binney","""Defoe was too busy with his politics at the moment to turn it to account; it was recalled to him later on, in the year 719, when the exploits of famous pirates had given a vivid interest to the chances of adventurers in far away islands on the American and African coasts. The Life, Adventures and Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton, who was set on shore in Madagascar, traversed the continent of Africa from east to west past the sources of the Nile, and went roving again in the company of the famous Captain Avery, was produced to satisfy the same demand. A more questionable venture in semi-journalism was made by Defoe in The Shortest Way with the Dissenters, which is still a matter of controversy. It was an outrageous pamphlet, so skilfully couched in language current at the time in the mouths of extreme Highchurchmen that the whole country was deceived, in which it was proposed to put a short term to Nonconformity by hanging every preacher in a conventicle and banishing the congregations. It met with all the paradoxical success that its author could have wished because it was accepted by the dominant Tory party with acclamation that was turned into fury, when the author was discovered to be a Dissenter, who had published it in mockery of the excesses of his opponents. Defoe had to stand in the pillory for three days and was fined and imprisoned. It may be questioned whether such a prank can be considered to be irony, when the key to the inverted point is not contained in the work itself but in some outside circumstance. True irony is an appeal in one form of words to two grades of intelligence, one of which accepts the literal and the other the concealed meaning. A much more indisputable instance of journalistic irony in our times was Henri Rocheforts eulogy of Napoleon II., equally effective with Defoes as a practical weapon and as a literary masterpiece of concealed invective for ever to be unexcelled. The validity of this irony consisted in facts that were known to all his readers, while the statement of them was inverted for reasons not of caprice nor cleverness but for a practical purpose for which there was every excuse. It is so short that the gist of it is worth quoting. It was in the second number of the notorious Lanterne, the first issue of which had been sold to the extent of 25/8,00 copies, that Rochefort complained that his political attitude had never been understood and that he was in fact an out and out Bonapartist. Nevertheless, he added, I may be allowed to choose my own hero in the dynasty. Amongst the legitimists some prefer Louis., others Louis XVI., others on the contrary place all their sympathy on the head of Charles X. As a Bonapartist, I prefer Napoleon II.; I have a right to do so. In my mind he represents the ideal of a sovereign. No one will deny that he has occupied the throne, because his successor calls himself Napoleon III. What a reign, my friends, what a reign! Not a tax; no useless wars, with the ravages they involve; none of those distant expeditions in which six hundred millions are spent to recover fifteen francs; no devouring civil lists; no ministers accumulating five or six posts at a hundred thousand francs each; that is the monarchy, as I understand it. Oh yes! Napoleon II., I love and admire you without reserve. Who then will dare maintain that I am not a sincere Bonapartist? Within a few weeks the Lanterne was suppressed and Rochefort was flying over the Belgian frontier. But his articles had prepared the Commune and eventually made France a Republic. Returning to England it is impossible, in mentioning Defoe, to refrain from opposing to him, not only politically but in a journalistic sense, his far more brilliant Tory opponents, Swift and Bolingbroke. It is true that their weapons were more effective at the time, because they were more aristocratic, but for that reason they are outside the stream of progress. Journalism is necessarily democratic. Bolingbroke with his Dissertation on Parties and the Patriot King anticipated Disraelis novels and the Saturday Review. Swift in his Drapiers Letters made one counter-move to the Whig government of his time, which showed that, if he had sufficiently valued the weapon of an ephemeral pen, there is no one living or dead, who could have beaten him either in literary style or in practical effectiveness. After Swift comes Junius, with his newly-discovered advertisement of anonymity, a long way behind, a kind of ostentatious but safely sheltered temerity colouring his natural tendency to seclusion and his disinclination to take the responsibility of parrying counter-attacks. Since the time of Junius there has been little literary matter in the press equally brilliant as well as ferocious. The battles of journalistic independence were fought more with the special message and the telegram than with the pen. Cobbett, Joseph Cowen and W. T. Stead may be held to be the best known names among what may be termed the aggressive school. Southey, Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, Hazlitt, R. H. Hutton, Meredith Townsend, W. T. Arnold and Andrew Lang may be quoted as the best representatives of the academic school. George Borrow, Lawrence Oliphant, W. E. Henley and G. W. Steevens may better be described as free lances owing obedience to no tradition. If we may single out one typical journalist, little known in London, who may stand forward as the representative writer of the century in England, just as Alexander Russel was beyond the Tweed, I should name Dr. Dunckley, at one time editor of the Manchester Examiner, who wrote for the daily press articles which came to take their place as some of the constitutional documents of this country. Writing under the name of Verax in a series of articles for his own paper, afterwards republished, he attracted widespread attention and was attacked with some bitterness in the Quarterly Review. Dunckley was at pains to warn the country against a threatened constitutional experiment similar to the unfortunate mistake of George III., whereby the direct influence of the Crown was to be reasserted for the benefit of one party in the State. He defended himself against the Quarterly with dignity and effect. When I began writing I never thought of challenging the verdict of so wide an audience. In the discharge of a semi-imposed and pleasant duty I merely wrote for my accustomed readers in these northern districts. I never dreamed that the country mouse would visit town. The reviewer says, I appear to pose as a tame Junius! If I had thought of posing at all, it would have been as Junius rampant. As a matter of posing one would have been just as easy as the other and of the two I should have preferred the renowned original. But the reviewer does me too much honour. I thought no more of Junius than of Tancred or Mungo Park. It is impossible to close this brief review of journalism without some reflections on that branch of it, which consists not in writing but in controlling and directing the writing of others. There is more than a distinction between the two functions, there is to some extent an opposition. Sheer brilliancy with the pen is not the best quality for an editor. If he has it, he must be sparing in its use; otherwise he will write every one else of considerable ability off his own paper and find himself, like Defoe, having to do alone and unaided everything of any special importance. That is not a possible position for any one to take up in a daily newspaper in modern times. A race of editors has thus grown up, who write hardly at all themselves and pass their lives as the perpetual directors and critics of others. In this respect our typical example is undoubtedly Delane, of whom we have fortunately much published information. By way of understanding the great step taken by the new tradition of an editors calling established by Delane we may recall Leigh Hunts confessions or views of his editorial work. The Hunts, father and son, when running, long since dead, made it a rule to isolate themselves from the world, to refuse dinner invitations and all personal intercourse with party leaders. They remained at home or at the office polishing paragraphs and evolving verses. I galloped, said Leigh Hunt through my editorial duties, took a world of superfluous pains in the writing, sat up very late at night and was a very trying person to compositors and newsmen. Delane on the other hand hardly ever took pen in hand, dined out every night in the season and went back to his house in Serjeants Inn, about a.m. only after he had seen the final proofs of everything which he considered important. It is said that in his thirty-seven years of editing Delane saw more sun-rises than any man in London. In keeping himself as the chief link of his paper with the world and confining himself at the office only to duties of guidance Delane remained always the best and finest judge of the course to be taken at the moment. This is speaking journalistically, because Delanes acuteness of judgment as to the psychology of London society was far from being consonant with the verdict of history or with special gifts of prophecy. To use Lord Salisburys phrase Delane often put his money on the wrong horse, notably in backing up the South against the North in the American civil war and in expecting an easy win for the French against the Prussians in 870. Although the Times soon saw that the Germans were gaining the upper hand, Delane originally wrote to Russell, I would lay my last shilling on Casquette against Pumpernickel. However that might be there was no revolting in the office against him.""","""Political Journalism and Its Practitioners""","2023","""Political journalism is a critical component of modern society, acting as a watchdog, informing the public, and holding political leaders accountable. Journalists in this field play a crucial role in shaping public opinion, uncovering corruption, and facilitating transparency in government actions. This profession requires a unique set of skills, ethical considerations, and a deep commitment to truth and accuracy.  Political journalists are tasked with the responsibility of investigating, analyzing, and reporting on political developments at various levels of government. They serve as intermediaries between policymakers and the public, translating complex political issues into understandable stories for their audience. Their work often involves attending press briefings, interviewing politicians, conducting research, and writing articles that provide context and insight into political events.  One of the primary purposes of political journalism is to keep the public informed about government actions and policies. Journalists act as a bridge between the government and the people, ensuring that citizens are aware of decisions made by their elected officials and the implications these decisions may have on their lives. By holding politicians accountable through investigative reporting and fact-checking, political journalists help promote transparency and integrity in the political process.  In addition to providing information, political journalism also plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion. Through their reporting, journalists can influence how the public perceives political figures, parties, and policies. By providing in-depth analysis, investigative reporting, and diverse perspectives, journalists help citizens make informed decisions about their political beliefs and values.  The practice of political journalism requires a unique set of skills and attributes. Journalists in this field must have a deep understanding of political systems, policies, and issues. They need strong communication skills to effectively interview politicians and convey complex information in a clear and engaging manner. Analytical thinking and critical reasoning are also essential for journalists to interpret political events and present them in a meaningful context.  Ethical considerations are paramount in political journalism. Journalists must adhere to principles of objectivity, fairness, and accuracy in their reporting. They must strive to present all sides of a story, verify information from multiple sources, and avoid conflicts of interest that could compromise their integrity. Upholding ethical standards is crucial for political journalists to maintain their credibility and trustworthiness with the public.  Political journalists often face challenges such as political pressure, censorship, and threats to their safety. In some countries, governments may restrict press freedom and limit journalists' ability to report on sensitive political issues. Journalists who investigate corruption or challenge those in power may face intimidation, harassment, or even violence. Despite these risks, many political journalists remain committed to their mission of upholding democracy and holding power to account.  The evolution of technology has transformed the practice of political journalism. The rise of social media and digital platforms has created new opportunities for journalists to engage with audiences, share news in real-time, and reach a global audience. At the same time, the spread of misinformation and the decline of traditional media outlets have posed challenges for political journalists in maintaining the quality and credibility of their reporting.  Despite these challenges, political journalism remains indispensable in a democratic society. By providing information, analysis, and scrutiny of political power, journalists help ensure that citizens are informed, engaged, and empowered to participate in the political process. The work of political journalists is essential for upholding democratic values, fostering accountability, and safeguarding the public interest.  In conclusion, political journalism and its practitioners play a vital role in informing the public, shaping public opinion, and holding power to account. Journalists in this field must possess a diverse set of skills, adhere to ethical principles, and navigate challenges to fulfill their duty to democracy. As guardians of truth and transparency, political journalists are integral to a healthy and functioning democracy.""","735"
"Thompson C J S  Charles John Samuel ","""The Chinese herbal, Rh-ya, which dates from about the fifth century, B.C., notices the fact that the hemp plant is of two kinds, the one producing seeds and the other flowers only. Herodotus states that hemp grows in Scythia both wild and cultivated, and that the Thracians made garments from it which can hardly be distinguished from linen. He also describes 'how the Scythians exposed themselves as in a bath' to the vapour of the seeds thrown on hot coals. The hemp occurs in two principal forms, viz.:. bhang, consisting of the dried leaves and small stalks of a dark green colour, mixed with a few fruits. It has a peculiar odour but little taste. Mixed with flour or incorporated with sweetmeat it is called hashish. It is also smoked, or taken infused in cold water.. Ganja consists of the flowering shoots of the female plant, having a compound or glutinous appearance, and is brownish-green in colour. Of the many curious experiences that have been written describing the effects of hashish, perhaps the most accurate is that given by Gautier, in which he relates his own experience of the drug. 'The Orientalists,' he states, 'have in consequence of the interdiction of wine sought that species of excitement which the Western nations derive from alcoholic drinks.' He then proceeds to state how a few minutes after swallowing some of the preparation, a sudden overwhelming sensation took possession of him. It appeared to him that his body was dissolved, and that he had become transparent. He clearly saw in his stomach the hashish he had swallowed, under the form of an emerald, from which a thousand little sparks issued. His eyelashes were lengthened out indefinitely, and rolled like threads of gold around ivory balls, which turned with inconceivable rapidity. Around him were sparklings of precious stones of all colours, changes eternally produced, like the play of a kaleidoscope. He every now and then saw his friends who were round him, disfigured as half men, half plants, some having the wings of the ostrich, which they were constantly shaking. So strange were these that he burst into fits of laughter, and, to join in the apparent ridiculousness of the affair, he began by throwing the cushions in the air, catching and turning them with the rapidity of an Indian juggler. One gentleman spoke to him in Italian, which the hashish transposed into Spanish. After a few minutes he recovered his habitual calmness, without any bad effect, and only with feelings of astonishment at what had passed. Half an hour had scarcely elapsed before he again fell under the influence of the drug. On this occasion the vision was more complicated and extraordinary. In the air there were millions of butterflies, confusedly luminous, shaking their wings like fans. Gigantic flowers, with chalices of crystal; large peonies upon beds of gold and silver, rose and surrounded him with the crackling sound that accompanies the explosion in the air of fireworks. His hearing acquired new power; it was enormously developed. He heard the noise of colours. Green, red, blue, yellow sounds reached him in waves--a glass thrown down, the creaking of a sofa, a word pronounced low, vibrated and rolled within him like peals of thunder. His own voice sounded so loud that he feared to speak, lest he should knock down the walls or explode like a rocket. More than five hundred clocks struck the hour with fleeting silvery voice, and every object touched gave a note like the harmonica or the olian harp. He swam in an ocean of sound, where floated like aisles of light some of the airs of 'Lucia di Lammermoor' and the 'Barber of Seville.' Never did similar bliss overwhelm him with its waves; he was lost in a wilderness of sweets; he was not himself; he was relieved from consciousness, that feeling which always pervades the mind; and for the first time he comprehended what might be the state of elementary beings, of angels, of souls separated from the body. All his system seemed infected with the fantastic colouring in which he was plunged. Sounds, perfume, light, reached him only by minute rays, in the midst of which he heard mystic currents whistling along. According to his calculation, this state lasted about three hundred years, for the sensations were so numerous and so hurried one upon the other, that a real appreciation of time was impossible. The paroxysm over, he was aware that it had only lasted a quarter of an hour. Another interesting account of the strange hallucinations produced by the drug is related by Dr. Moreau, who with two friends experimented with hashish. 'At first,' he states, 'I thought my companions were less influenced by the drug than myself. Then, as the effect increased, I fancied that the person who had brought me the dose had given me some of more active quality. This, I thought to myself, was an imprudence, and the involuntary idea presented itself that I might be poisoned. The idea became fixed; I called out loudly to Dr. Roche, 'You are an assassin; you have poisoned me!' This was received with shouts of laughter, and my lamentations excited mirth. I struggled for some time against the thought, but the greater the effort the more completely did it overcome me, till at last it took full possession of my mind. The extravagant conviction now came uppermost that I was dead, and upon the point of being buried; my soul had left my body. In a few minutes I had gone through all the stages of delirium.' These fixed ideas and erroneous convictions are apt to be produced, but they only last a few seconds, unless there is any actual physical disorder. 'The Orientalist, when he indulges in hashish retires into the depth of his harem; no one is then admitted who cannot contribute to his enjoyment. He surrounds himself with his dancing girls, who perform their graceful evolutions before him to the sound of music; gradually a new condition of the brain allows a series of illusions, arising from the external senses, to present themselves. The mind becomes overpowered by the brilliancy of gorgeous visions; discrimination, comparison, reason, yield up their throne to dreams and phantoms which exhilarate and delight. 'The mind tries to understand what is the cause of the new delight, but it is in vain. It seems to know there is no reality.' Hardly two people experience the same effects from hashish. Upon some it has little action, while upon others, especially women, it exerts extraordinary power. While one person says he imagined his body endowed with such elasticity, that he fancied he could enter into a bottle and remain there at his ease, another fancied he had become the piston of a steam engine; under the influence of the drug the ear lends itself more to the illusion than any other sense. Its first effect is one of intense exhilaration, almost amounting to delirium; power of thought is soon lost, and the victim laughs, cries and sings or dances, all the time imagining he is acting rationally. The second stage is one of dreamy enjoyment followed by a dead stupor. Of the ordinary physical effects of hashish, the first is a feeling of slight compression of the temporal bones and upper parts of the head. The respiration is gentle, the pulse is increased, and a gentle heat is felt all over the surface of the body. There is a sense of weight about the fore part of the arms, and an occasional slight involuntary motion, as if to seek relief from it. There is a feeling of discomfort about the extremities, creating a feeling of uneasiness, and if the dose has been too large the usual symptoms of poisoning by Indian hemp show themselves. Flushes of heat seem to ascend, to the head, even to the brain, which create considerable alarm. Singing in the ears is complained of; then comes on a state of anxiety, almost of anguish, with a sense of constriction about the chest. The individual fancies he hears the beating of his heart with unaccustomed loudness; but throughout the whole period it is the nervous system that is affected, and in this way the drug differs materially from opium whose action on the muscular and digestive systems is most marked. It is somewhat remarkable that Indian hemp fails to produce the same intoxicating effects in this country that it does in warmer climates, and whether this is due to the loss of some volatile principle or difference in temperature it is not yet determined. But would-be experimentalists in the effects of hashish would do well to remember that it may not be indulged in with impunity, and most authorities agree that the brain becomes eventually disordered with frequent indulgence in the drug even in India. It further becomes weakened and incapable of separating the true from the false; frequent intoxication leads to a condition of delirium, and usually of a dangerous nature; the moral nature becomes numbed, and the victim at last becomes unfit to pursue his ordinary avocation. It is stated by those who have had considerable experience in its use, that even during the dream of joy there is a consciousness that all is illusion; there is at no period a belief that anything that dances before the senses or plays upon the imagination is real, and that when the mind recovers its equilibrium it knows that all is but a phantasm. LORE FEW, perchance, of the millions who gather comfort from the 'herb of fragrance' are aware that it is to Don Hernandez de Toledo we are indebted for the introduction of tobacco into Western Europe, which he first brought to Spain and Portugal in 5/85/89. Jean Nicot was at this time Ambassador at the Court of Lisbon from Frances II, and it was he who transmitted or carried, either the seed or the plant to Catherine de Medicis, and who gave it the name Nicotiana. Like other great personages of the time, Catherine encouraged the homage of travellers and artists.""","""Effects of hashish and cannabis.""","2072","""Hashish and cannabis are two popular substances derived from the cannabis plant that have been utilized for various purposes throughout history. Both substances contain cannabinoids, the chemical compounds responsible for their psychoactive effects. While they share some similarities in terms of their effects on the body and mind, there are also distinct differences between the two. Understanding the effects of hashish and cannabis is crucial for individuals considering their use, policymakers crafting regulations, and healthcare professionals providing care to patients dealing with substance use.  Hashish, also known as hash, is a concentrated form of cannabis made from the resin of the plant. It typically appears as a solid block or paste and is consumed by smoking, vaporizing, or adding to food. Cannabis, on the other hand, refers to the dried flowers, leaves, stems, and seeds of the cannabis plant and is consumed in various forms such as smoking, vaping, or ingesting edibles. Both hashish and cannabis contain the cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is primarily responsible for the psychoactive effects experienced by users.  The effects of hashish and cannabis can vary depending on factors such as the method of consumption, dosage, individual tolerance, and overall health. When consumed, both substances interact with the body's endocannabinoid system, a complex network of receptors that play a role in regulating various physiological processes. Some of the common effects of hashish and cannabis include relaxation, euphoria, altered perception of time and space, increased appetite, and heightened sensory perception. Users may also experience mild to moderate impairment in cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and decision-making.  One of the key differences between hashish and cannabis lies in their potency. Hashish is more potent than cannabis due to its concentrated form, which means that users may experience stronger and more immediate effects when consuming hashish. This heightened potency can also increase the risk of adverse effects such as anxiety, paranoia, and hallucinations, especially in individuals who are inexperienced or sensitive to the effects of cannabinoids.  In addition to their psychoactive effects, hashish and cannabis also have potential therapeutic benefits. Cannabidiol (CBD) is another cannabinoid found in both substances that has been studied for its potential medicinal properties, including pain relief, anti-inflammatory effects, and anxiety reduction. Medical cannabis, which refers to cannabis used for medicinal purposes, has gained recognition for its efficacy in managing symptoms of various health conditions such as chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and nausea related to chemotherapy.  However, despite the therapeutic potential of hashish and cannabis, there are also risks associated with their use. Regular and heavy use of these substances can lead to dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms when consumption is reduced or stopped. Long-term use of hashish and cannabis has been linked to cognitive impairments, respiratory issues, mental health disorders, and an increased risk of addiction. In adolescent users, prolonged cannabis use has been shown to impact brain development and cognitive function, highlighting the importance of educating young individuals about the risks associated with cannabis consumption.  From a legal perspective, the status of hashish and cannabis varies across countries and jurisdictions. While some regions have legalized the use of cannabis for medical or recreational purposes, others maintain strict regulations that criminalize possession, distribution, and cultivation of the plant. The legalization of cannabis has sparked debates surrounding public health, criminal justice, taxation, and regulation of the industry. Policymakers face the challenge of balancing the potential economic benefits of a legal cannabis market with concerns about substance abuse, public safety, and underage access.  In conclusion, hashish and cannabis are versatile substances with a complex interplay of effects on the body and mind. While they offer recreational enjoyment and potential therapeutic benefits, it is essential for individuals to approach their use with caution and awareness of the associated risks. Education, harm reduction strategies, and evidence-based policies are crucial in promoting responsible use of hashish and cannabis while minimizing the negative consequences that can arise from their misuse. By fostering an informed and balanced approach to these substances, society can navigate the complexities of cannabis use while prioritizing the well-being of individuals and communities.""","823"
"Warner Henry James","""(2) The world and all that is in it were created by the evil God. (3) They held some Valentinian ideas. (4) The Son of Man was not really incarnate in the Virgin Mary, and did not eat--in short, Docetism. (5/8) The patriarchs were the servants of the Devil. (6) The Devil was the author of the Old Testament, except Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus and the Major and Minor Prophets. (7) The world will never end. (8) The Judgement is past. (9) Hell is in this world. This detailed examination of the heresy is of great importance, not only on account of the peculiar advantages which Reineri Saccho possessed as both heretic and inquisitor, but because it shews that even at this late stage, Catharist and Waldensian had not been welded into one under the blows of a persecution directed equally against both. At one in their hatred of the Roman Church and all its works, there is a marked difference in their deism. The Waldensian, according to Saccho's classification, knows nothing of Dualism, is sound on the doctrine of the Trinity, and believes both Old and New Testaments to be the Word of God. The Catharist, on the other hand, believes in a good and an evil God, the latter being the Creator of the world of matter, which therefore is itself evil. Hence, whatever perpetuates matter, e.g. marriage, is also evil; but the world being the work of a God must also, like its maker, be endless. That part of the Old Testament which describes its beginning and its development into kingdoms and hierarchies, together with all their chief representatives, be they patriarchs, princes or priests, has the evil God for its author. Only the poets and the prophets who took a more spiritual view of things earthly, are inspired by the good God. 7. By the middle of the thirteenth century the coercive measures which Rome took for the suppression of heresy had proved successful. No longer was there any need for Councils to examine and pass judgment upon it, nor defenders of the faith to write against it. It had become une chose jugee. Henceforth the Church dealt with individuals, and by means of ecclesiastical Courts, called the Inquisition, arrested, questioned and decided whether a person, charged with heresy, was guilty or not. Unfortunately for the cause of history the earlier records, or Acta, of these Inquisitions were, in their brief spells of resurgence, destroyed by the Catharists and Waldenses, as containing dangerous evidence against them. Only the later ones have survived. Limborch, who made the Inquisition his special study, published the 'Book of the Sentences' which the Inquisition of against the Waldenses and Albigenses, and he came to the conclusion that while they had some dogmas in common, they had different opinions and were separate sects. According to him the Waldenses and Albigenses had only three opinions in common: All oaths are unlawful; any good man can receive a Confession, but only God can absolve from sin; no obedience is due to the Roman Church. The following opinions he ascribes to the Albigenses, and not to the Waldenses: There are two Gods, good and evil; the Sacraments of the Church of Rome are vain and unprofitable--the Eucharist is merely bread--a man is saved by the imposition of their hands--sins are remitted without Confession and satisfaction--Baptism avails nothing; Baptism by water is of no benefit to children, since they are so far from consenting to it that they weep--the Order of St. James, or Extreme Unction, made by material oil, signifies nothing; they prefer imposition of hands--repudiate the constitution of the whole Roman Church, and deny to all the Prelates of it the power of binding and loosing, on the ground that they are greater sinners than those whom they claim to bind and loose; but give the Holy Spirit--matrimony is always sinful, except spiritual matrimony; Christ did not take a real human body, but only the likeness of one--the Virgin Mary is not and was not a real woman; the Virgin Mary is true penitence whereby people are born into their Church; there is a kind of spiritual body or inner man whereby persons rise from the dead; the Cross is the sign of the Devil, and should not be adored, since no man adores the gallows on which his father was hanged; souls are spirits banished from heaven on account of their sins; they deny purgatory altogether. Opinions ascribed to the Waldenses, but not to the Albigenses: all judgement is forbidden of God, and therefore it is a sin for any judge to condemn a man to any are worthless; purgatory exists only in this life, and therefore prayers cannot profit the dead; the Church has only three Orders--Bishops, Priests and Deacons; laymen can preach; matrimony is sinful only when people marry without hope of offspring. The Records of the several Inquisitions are helpful in the particulars which they furnish of the government, organization and services of the Albigenses and Waldenses. Unfortunately in many cases their dates and places are missing, and hence they fail us in an attempt to trace any change or development in their doctrines. The general date of these Acta is the beginning of the fourteenth century, and from these and certain scraps of other Inquisitions which have been preserved, we are able to amplify somewhat Limborch's conclusions. Thus the Report of the Inquisition of Carcassonne treats separately 'De Manichaeis moderni temporis' and 'De Waldensibus moderni temporis,' whose origin they trace to a certain citizen of Lyons, Valdesius or Valdens, in A.D. 170, and who spread to Lombardy, 'et praecisi ab ecclesia, cum aliis haereticis se miscentes et eorum errores imbibentes, suis adinventionibus antiquorum haereticorum errores et haereses miscuerunt.' As the Report adds 'quia olim plures alios habuerunt,' we cannot say whether in the opinion of the Court the balance was or was not in favour of the Waldenses, but it does mark a change, by subtraction and addition, in the total. The Inquisitors complained that the Waldenses were very slippery and evasive under examination. When driven into a corner, they would plead that they were unlearned, simple folk and did not understand the question. Then they contended that to take an oath was a clear violation of Christ's words in St. Matthew v., and therefore a grievous sin; yet according to the Report of the Inquisition of Carcassonne they pleaded that they might swear if by so doing they could escape death themselves or screen others from death by not betraying their friends or revealing the secrets of their sect. Their defence was that they were filled with the Holy Ghost and were doing His work; to injure or cut short that work was to sin the sin against the Holy Ghost, which hath never forgiveness. Thus in a lawsuit a heretic might take the oath, because refusal meant revelation; he would be absolved on confession. But when they were ordered to take the oath, 'juro per ista sancta evangelia quod nunquam didici vel credidi aliquid quod sit contra fidem veram quam sancta Romana ecclesia credit et tenet,' with uplifted hand and touching the Gospels, i.e. ex animo, they prevaricated. Another instance of this evasiveness was their outward conformity to the established religion. They would attend Church and behave with the utmost decorum; in conversation with a known Catholic their speech was most orthodox and prudent. Although they would not touch a woman, or even sit on the same bench with her, however great the distance between them, they travelled with them, because it would be then supposed that they were their wives, and hence that they themselves were not heretics. They denied that prayers of saints or to saints were of any avail, yet they abstained from work on Saints' Days, unless they could work unobserved. A 'Perfect' must not be married, but if he burn, he could satisfy the lust of the flesh so long as he remained pure in heart. This concession they, however, kept secret from the Credents, lest they should fall in their esteem. In another Inquisition at Carcassonne, held in A.D. 308 and 309, 'contra Albigenses,' Peter and James Auteri, who with other members of their family, were the last leaders of the Albigenses, declared that true Matrimony is not between male and female, for that is two kinds of flesh, not one, whereas God said, 'They two shall become one flesh.' The true Matrimony is between the soul and the Spirit. 'For in Paradise there was never a corruption of the flesh nor anything which was not purely spiritual, and God made Matrimony itself for this end--that souls which had fallen from Heaven through pride in ignorance and were in this world should return to life Matrimony of the Holy Spirit, viz. by good works and abstinence from sins, and 'they two would become one flesh' (in carne una).' The testimony of Raymond de Costa given before the Inquisition of Languedoc is so divergent from all other evidence and so subversive of the fundamental principles and practices of the Waldenses that, although he was a Waldensian Deacon, his statements may be received with suspicion. According to him the Credents were instructed to obey the Cures of the Roman Church and to attend Mass because there they could see the Body of Jesus Christ and adore it (or Him), and pray for a good end and forgiveness of sins. Their Sacraments and those of the Roman Church were equally valid. Peter was the head of the Church after Christ, and the Roman Pontiffs after Peter, and their own 'Majors' were under the Pope; if the Roman Church disappeared, they would all become pagans.""","""Religious Heresies and Inquisition History""","2153","""Religious heresies and the Inquisition have played significant roles in shaping the course of human history, particularly during the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period. This complex and often controversial topic delves into issues of belief, power, control, and the pursuit of religious orthodoxy. Understanding the context of religious heresies and the Inquisition involves exploring the interplay between religious institutions, political authorities, and individual beliefs.  Heresy, in its simplest form, refers to beliefs or practices that diverge from established religious doctrine. Throughout history, religious communities have viewed heresy as a threat to their cohesion and authority. The response to heresy has varied across different faith traditions and eras, with some adopting more tolerant approaches while others resorting to persecution and violence. Heresies have sometimes emerged as challenges to prevailing religious norms, offering alternative interpretations of faith or questioning the legitimacy of established authorities.  The Inquisition, initially established by the Catholic Church in the 12th century, aimed to combat heresy and maintain doctrinal purity. The medieval Inquisition primarily targeted groups such as the Cathars and Waldensians, who held heterodox beliefs deemed dangerous to the Church's authority. In the following centuries, the Inquisition expanded its reach, particularly during the Spanish Inquisition in the late 15th and 16th centuries, which sought to enforce religious conformity in Spain and its territories.  The Spanish Inquisition, under the authority of the Spanish monarchy and the Catholic Church, utilized brutal tactics to root out heresy, often through trials, confessions obtained under duress, and punishments that included imprisonment, torture, and execution. The Inquisition operated through a network of tribunals, in which inquisitors held significant power to investigate, prosecute, and sentence individuals accused of heresy. The fear instilled by the Inquisition had a chilling effect on dissent and contributed to the enforcement of religious orthodoxy in Spain.  While the Inquisition's methods were undeniably harsh and marked by injustices, its defenders argued that it served to safeguard religious unity and prevent the spread of ideas deemed heretical. Critics, however, viewed the Inquisition as a tool of repression, used to maintain political control and eliminate dissent within society. The Inquisition's impact extended beyond the realm of religion, influencing cultural, social, and political dynamics in Europe and its colonies.  Some of the most well-known heresies that sparked the attention of the Inquisition include the Catharism of southern France, the Hussite movement in Bohemia, and the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. These movements challenged the authority of the Catholic Church, advocating for reforms or offering alternative theological perspectives. The Church's response to these heresies varied, with some encounters leading to reconciliation or theological debates, while others resulted in violent suppression and excommunication.  The Inquisition was not limited to the Catholic Church, as Protestant authorities also established their own mechanisms to combat heresy during the Protestant Reformation. The Counter-Reformation, initiated by the Catholic Church in response to the Protestant movement, aimed to address internal corruption and doctrinal challenges while reinforcing traditional teachings. This period witnessed ongoing conflicts and theological debates, often accompanied by accusations of heresy and the suppression of dissenting voices on both sides.  The legacy of religious heresies and the Inquisition continues to resonate in contemporary discussions on faith, power, and religious freedom. While the Inquisition as an institution has largely faded into history, its impact on religious discourse, freedom of thought, and the relationship between church and state endures. The lessons learned from the repression of heresies serve as reminders of the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism and the importance of upholding religious tolerance and diversity of beliefs.  In conclusion, the history of religious heresies and the Inquisition offers a lens through which to examine the complexities of faith, authority, and dissent. These phenomena reflect the interplay of theological convictions, political ambitions, and societal norms that have shaped the course of religious history. As we navigate contemporary challenges related to religious pluralism and tolerance, understanding the legacy of heresies and inquisitions can provide valuable insights into the ongoing quest for religious freedom and coexistence in a diverse world.""","848"
"Birkenhead Frederick Edwin Smith Earl of","""Notwithstanding the chill seas in which it lies, Newfoundland is not in fact a cold country. The Arctic current lowers the temperature of the east coast, but the Gulf Stream, whilst producing fogs, moderates the cold. The thermometer seldom or never sinks below zero in winter, and in summer extreme heat is unknown. Nor is its northerly detachment without compensation, for at times the Aurora borealis illumines the sky with a brilliancy unknown further south. A misconception appears to prevail that the island is in summer wrapped in fog, and its shores in winter engirt by ice. In the interior the climate is very much like that of Canada, but is not so severe as that of western Canada or even of Ontario and Quebec. The sky is bright and the weather clear, and the salubrity is shown by the healthy appearance of the population. The natural advantages of the country are very great, though for centuries many of them were strangely overlooked. Whitbourne, it is true, wrote with quaint enthusiasm, in the early sixteenth century: 'I am loth to weary acquainting thee thus to those famous, faire, and profitable rivers, and likewise to those delightful large and inestimable woods, and also with those fruitful and enticing lulls and delightful vallies.' In fact, in the interior the valleys are almost as numerous as Whitbourne's adjectives, and their fertility promises a great future for agriculture when the railway has done its work. The rivers, though 'famous, faire, and profitable,' are not overpoweringly majestic. The largest are the Exploits River, 00 miles long and navigable for some 0 miles, and the Gander, 00 miles long, which--owing to the contour of the island--flows to the eastern bays. The deficiency, however, if it amounts to one, is little felt, for Newfoundland excels other lands in the splendour of its bays, which not uncommonly pierce the land as far as sixty miles. The length of the coast-line has been calculated at about 000 miles--one of the longest of all countries of the world relatively to the area. Another noteworthy physical feature is the great number of lakes and ponds; more than a third of the area is occupied by water. The largest lake is Grand Lake, 6 miles long, broad, with an area of nearly 00 square miles. The longest mountain range in the island is about the same length as the longest river, 00 miles; and the highest peaks do not very greatly exceed 000 feet. The cliffs, which form a brown, bleak and rugged barrier round the coasts of Newfoundland, varying in height from 00 to 00 feet, must have seemed grim enough to the first discoverers; in fact, they give little indication of the charming natural beauties which lie behind them. The island is exuberantly rich in woodland, and its long penetrating bays, running in some cases eighty to ninety miles inland, and fringed to the water's edge, vividly recall the more familiar attractiveness of Norwegian scenery. Nor has any custom staled its infinite variety, for as a place of resort it has been singularly free from vogue. This is a little hard to understand, for the summer climate is by common consent delightful, and the interior still retains much of the glamour of the imperfectly explored. The cascades of Rocky River, of the Exploits River, and, in particular, the Grand Falls, might in themselves be considered a sufficient excuse for a voyage which barely exceeds a week. Newfoundland is rich in mineral promise. Its history in this respect goes back only about sixty years: in 85/87 a copper deposit was discovered at Tilt Cove, a small fishing village in Notre Dame Bay, where seven years later the Union Mine was opened. It is now clear that copper ore is to be found in quantities almost as inexhaustible as the supply of codfish. There are few better known copper mines in the world than Bett's Cove Mine and Little Bay Mine; and there are copper deposits also at Hare Bay and Tilt Cove. In 905/8- the copper ore exported from these mines was valued at more than 75/8,00 dollars, in 910-1 at over 45/8,00 dollars. The value of the iron ore produced in the latter period was,68,00 dollars. It is claimed that the iron deposits--red hematite ore--are among the richest in the world. In Newfoundland, as elsewhere, geology taught capital where to strike, and when the interior is more perfectly explored it is likely that fresh discoveries will be made. In the meantime gold, lead, zinc, silver, talc, antimony, and coal have also been worked at various places. A more particular account must be given of the great fish industry, on which Newfoundland so largely depends, and which forms about 0 per cent. of the total exports. For centuries a homely variant of Lord Rosebery's Egyptian epigram would have been substantially true: Newfoundland is the codfish and the codfish is Newfoundland. Many, indeed, are the uses to which this versatile fish may be put. Enormous quantities of dried cod are exported each year for the human larder, a hygienic but disagreeable oil is extracted from the liver to try the endurance of invalids; while the refuse of the carcase is in repute as a stimulating manure. The cod fisheries of Newfoundland are much larger than those of any other country in the world; and the average annual export has been equal to that of Canada and Norway put together. The predominance of the fishing industry, and its ubiquitous influence in the colony are vividly emphasised by Mr Rogers in the following passage, though his first sentence involves an exaggerated restriction so far as modern conditions are concerned: 'Newfoundlanders are men of one idea, and that idea is fish. Their lives are devoted to the sea and its produce, and their language mirrors their lives; thus the chief streets in their chief towns are named Water Street, guides are called pilots, and visits cruises. Conversely, land words have sea meanings, and a 'planter,' which meant in the eighteenth century a fishing settler as opposed to a fishing visitor, meant in the nineteenth century--when fishing visitors ceased to come from England--a shipowner or skipper. The very animals catch the infection, and dogs, cows, and bears eat fish. Fish manures the fields. Fish, too, is the main-spring of the history of Newfoundland, and split and dried fish, or what was called in the fifteenth century stock-fish, has always been its staple, and in Newfoundland fish means cod.' The principal home of the cod is the Grand Newfoundland Bank, an immense submarine island 00 miles in length and 00 in breadth, which in earlier history probably formed part of North America. Year by year the demand for codfish grows greater, and the supply--unaffected by centuries of exaction--continues to satisfy the demand. This happy result is produced by the marvellous fertility of the cod, for naturalists tell us that the roe of a single female--accounting, perhaps, for half the whole weight of the fish--commonly contains as many as five millions of ova. In the year 912-3 the value of the exported dried codfish alone was,87,89 dollars, and in 917 the total output of the bank and shore cod fishery was valued at 3,80,00 dollars; and at a time when it was incomparably less, Pitt had thundered in his best style that he would not surrender the Newfoundland fisheries though the enemy were masters of the Tower of London. So the great Bacon, at a time when the wealth of the Incas was being revealed to the dazzled eyes of the Old World, declared, with an admirable sense of proportion, that the fishing banks of Newfoundland were richer far than the mines of Mexico and Peru. Along the coasts of Norfolk and Suffolk the codfish is commonly caught with hook and line, and the same primitive method is still largely used by colonial fishermen. More elaborate contrivances are growing in favour, and will inevitably swell each year's returns. Nor is there cause to apprehend exhaustion in the supply. The ravages of man are as nothing to the ravages and exactions of marine nature, and both count for little in the immense populousness of the ocean. Fishing on a large scale is most effectively carried on by the Baltow system or one of its modifications. Each vessel carries thousands of fathoms of rope, baited and trailed at measured intervals. Thousands of hooks thus distributed over many miles, and the whole suitably moored. After a night's interval the catch is examined. In 890 a Fisheries Commission was established for the purpose of conducting the fisheries more efficiently than had been the case before. Modern methods were introduced, and the artificial propagation of cod and also of lobsters was begun. In 898 a Department of Marine and Fisheries was set up, and with the minister in charge of it an advisory Fisheries Board was associated. Though the cod-fishery is the largest and the most important of the Newfoundland fisheries, the seal, lobster, herring, whale and salmon fisheries are also considerable, and yield high returns. As to all these fisheries, the right to make regulations has been placed more effectively in the hands of Great Britain by the Hague arbitration award, which was published in September 910, and which satisfied British claims to a very large extent. A pathetic chapter in the history of colonization might be written upon the fate of native races. A great English authority on international dealt with their claims to the proprietorship of American soil in a very summary way.""","""Newfoundland's climate and natural resources""","2005","""Newfoundland, the easternmost province of Canada, boasts a distinctive climate and a treasure trove of natural resources that have shaped its landscape and economy. The island's climate is influenced by its maritime location, resulting in cool summers, mild winters, and abundant precipitation. These climatic conditions have a profound impact on the natural resources found in Newfoundland, shaping its ecosystems and the industries that rely on them.  One of the defining characteristics of Newfoundland's climate is its variability. The province experiences a range of weather patterns due to its location at the meeting point of the warm Gulf Stream and the cold Labrador Current. This convergence creates a volatile atmospheric environment characterized by fog, wind, and rapidly changing weather conditions. The island's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean also makes it susceptible to storm systems and high levels of precipitation, contributing to its lush and diverse ecosystems.  Newfoundland's cool summers and mild winters are a result of the maritime influence, with temperatures moderated by the ocean. Summers are generally cool and pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 15 to 20 degrees Celsius. Winters are mild compared to other Canadian provinces, with temperatures typically staying above freezing along the coast. However, inland areas experience colder temperatures and heavier snowfall, particularly in the central and northern regions of the island.  Precipitation is a significant characteristic of Newfoundland's climate, with ample rainfall throughout the year. The island receives an average of 1,200 to 1,900 millimeters of precipitation annually, contributing to the lush vegetation and numerous bodies of water found across the province. The combination of rainfall and melting snow feeds a network of rivers and lakes that support diverse aquatic ecosystems and provide resources for industries like fishing and hydroelectric power generation.  Newfoundland's climate plays a crucial role in shaping its natural resources, which include forests, minerals, fisheries, and hydroelectric potential. The island's forests, primarily composed of coniferous species like spruce and fir, cover vast tracts of land and are a valuable source of timber and pulp for the forestry industry. The abundance of forests also contributes to the biodiversity of Newfoundland, providing habitat for wildlife such as moose, black bears, and various bird species.  Mineral resources are another essential component of Newfoundland's natural wealth, with the province hosting significant deposits of minerals like iron ore, nickel, copper, and zinc. Mining has been a traditional industry in Newfoundland, dating back to the 19th century when iron ore was first extracted from Bell Island. Today, mining operations contribute to the provincial economy, providing employment opportunities and contributing to exports.  The fisheries sector is a cornerstone of Newfoundland's economy, with the province's rich marine resources supporting a thriving seafood industry. The cold and nutrient-rich waters of the North Atlantic Ocean teem with a variety of fish species, including cod, haddock, salmon, and shellfish. Fishing has been a way of life for Newfoundlanders for centuries, shaping their culture and traditions while providing sustenance and economic prosperity.  Hydroelectric power generation is another important natural resource in Newfoundland, harnessing the island's abundant water resources to produce clean energy. The province boasts several hydroelectric facilities that exploit its numerous rivers and waterfalls to generate electricity for local consumption and export. Newfoundland's commitment to renewable energy sources aligns with global efforts to combat climate change and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.  In conclusion, Newfoundland's climate and natural resources are intertwined in a complex relationship that shapes the island's ecosystems, industries, and way of life. The province's unique maritime climate influences its weather patterns and supports diverse ecosystems that sustain a wide range of natural resources. From forests and minerals to fisheries and hydroelectric power, Newfoundland's wealth of natural resources has been a driving force in its economy and culture, making it a region of both environmental significance and economic potential.""","759"
"Schappelle Benjamin Franklin 1885 ","""The official data offered by the Bureau of Statistics of the 'Ministerio da Agricultura' in Rio concerning immigration directly from Europe begins with the year 820. That concerning immigration from Germany in particular begins with 827. Official figures are available as to the number of immigrants from Germany from that date to the present excepting the years 830-836 inclusive, 838, 839, 843, 844, 846, 848 and 849. The total is 28,33 up to the end of the year 915/8. In order to determine the approximate numerical value of the German element in the population of Brazil, many estimates worthy of consideration have been compared. The estimates which in the opinion of the writer have the strongest claim to accuracy, are listed below. As will be seen, those determined upon by Friedrich Sommer, Direktor of the 'Banco Allemao Transatlantico' of Sao Paulo are largely followed. This authority has for years been making a careful study of the subject and consequently his conclusions bear particular weight. Taking up the states in the order as previously, we have: Bahia. No reliable estimates except as contained below in 'Northern and Central States.' Minas Geraes.,00. Sommer. Espirito Santo. 5/8,00. Ludwig Rio (Fed. Dist.). 8,00. Sommer. Sao Paulo. 2,00. Ibid.

Making a fairly liberal allowance for underestimates, we may regard the number 00,00 as representing the total number of citizens of German descent in Brazil to-day.: = II.= THE. THE AND FOR THE OF THE. As may be inferred from chapter I, the German immigration into Brazil antedating the nineteenth century was quite insignificant. Beginning with the early years of that century, however, there was a steady current of new settlers from the German-speaking sections of Europe into the southern part of the country. The people who made up this current settled, particularly during the early years, in small, widely separated colonial nuclei where they found themselves more or less thoroughly cut off from the outside world and its influences. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that these people have developed a new dialect which we may call 'Brazilian German.' The Germanic settlers from Europe who had come to Brazil found themselves located in surroundings radically different from the ones to which they had been accustomed in the land of their nativity. Physically they had to adapt themselves to a new climate. From the moment of their arrival on the parcel of land allotted to them they were in contact with many objects for which their mother tongue offered no designation. The animals, plants, insects and even the agricultural implements in the new home land had, to a large extent, names for which the German language offered no equivalent. As a result, many non-germanic words had to be immediately adopted. In reference to the older colonies, the German-speaking immigrants from any particular section of Germany, Switzerland or Austria would more or less settle in a particular section of Brazil. Thus we have Petropolis in Rio de Janeiro settled by former inhabitants of the Coblenz district and Blumenau in Santa Catharina settled largely by Pomeranians. In a general way it may be stated that the older colonies were in this respect relatively homogenious, while those founded since the middle of the past century drew their settlers to a larger extent from different German-speaking sections of Europe. The settlers, largely drawn from the agricultural class, naturally brought with them from Europe a variety of German dialects. These were more or less preserved depending on the relative isolation of the colonies.""","""German Immigration to Brazil""","808","""German Immigration to Brazil brought a significant cultural and economic influence to the South American nation. The migration of Germans to Brazil started in the early 19th century and continued throughout the years, shaping various aspects of Brazilian society. The reasons for German immigration to Brazil were diverse, ranging from economic opportunities to political instability in Germany.  One of the key factors that drove German immigrants to Brazil was the promise of land for agricultural settlement. The Brazilian government actively promoted European immigration to develop the vast tracts of land in the southern regions of the country. German immigrants, known for their agricultural skills and hard work ethic, were attracted to the opportunity to establish prosperous farms in Brazil.  The Germans settled primarily in the southern states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Paraná. These regions offered a climate and landscape similar to their homeland, making it easier for them to adapt to the new environment. Over time, German immigrants formed tight-knit communities, maintaining their language, traditions, and cultural practices. Their presence significantly impacted the local culture, cuisine, and architecture in these regions.  German immigrants also contributed to the industrial and commercial sectors in Brazil. They brought with them knowledge and expertise in various industries, such as brewing, metalworking, and engineering. Many German immigrants established successful businesses, contributing to the economic development of Brazil. Some of the most iconic Brazilian beer brands have German roots, showcasing the lasting influence of German immigrants in the country's brewing industry.  The cultural impact of German immigration on Brazil is evident in various aspects of Brazilian life. German traditions, such as Oktoberfest celebrations and traditional folk dances, have become integrated into Brazilian culture. The architecture in German-influenced regions reflects a mix of German and Brazilian styles, creating a unique architectural heritage in these areas. Additionally, German cuisine, including dishes like sausages and sauerkraut, has become popular in Brazil, showcasing the culinary exchange between the two cultures.  Despite their contributions to Brazilian society, German immigrants faced challenges and discrimination upon their arrival. Language barriers, cultural differences, and prejudice sometimes made integration difficult for German immigrants. However, over time, many German immigrants were able to overcome these obstacles and establish themselves as respected members of Brazilian society.  Today, the legacy of German immigration to Brazil is still visible in the customs, traditions, and heritage of the country. The descendants of German immigrants continue to celebrate their roots and maintain their cultural identity while also embracing their Brazilian heritage. German-Brazilian communities thrive in the southern regions of Brazil, preserving their unique cultural heritage and contributing to the rich tapestry of Brazilian society.  In conclusion, German immigration to Brazil has left a lasting impact on the country, shaping its culture, economy, and identity. The contributions of German immigrants continue to be celebrated and honored, highlighting the importance of cultural diversity and exchange in shaping a vibrant and dynamic society like Brazil.""","574"
"Young Jennie J ","""The firm of Coxon & Co. was founded, in 863, by Mr. Charles Coxon, and is now composed of his widow, J. G. Forman, and S. M. Alpaugh. Mr. Coxon began with cream-colored ware, and conjoined it with white granite toward the end of 863. Since that time the firm has produced both qualities. One of the later establishments is the Mercer Pottery, built in 868, of which Mr. James Moses is sole proprietor. Besides the common grades of earthen-ware, stone china and semi-porcelain are made and decorated. There is a decided tendency here toward the production of a finer quality of ware, and of styles of decoration possessed of artistic merit. At the Arsenal Pottery Mr. Joseph Mayer manufactures Rockingham and brown stone-ware, and is in the possession of a number of excellent designs. Of the remaining Trenton potteries--the East Trenton Pottery Company, the American Crockery Company, Joseph H. Moore's, the Greenwood Pottery Company, and the Millham--it is unnecessary to give details. Within the past two or three years all have been turning their attention to work of a more or less artistic character, some directing their efforts more particularly to decorating, and others to the perfecting of a body which shall enable them to compete with the manufacturers of porcelain. In the latter respect the Greenwood company has met with gratifying success, and has given their ware the name of 'American China.' It will thus be seen that the history of modern American art and manufacture does not extend much beyond a century. Progress has been rapid, and the trade has developed with gigantic strides. It is estimated that there are in all seven hundred and seventy-seven pottery establishments in the United States, including those for all kinds of ware, from terra-cotta to porcelain. All, or nearly all, these have sprung up within twenty-five years, and many of them since the Civil War. The productive capacity of some of the leading centres may be judged from the number of kilns they require. At Trenton there are fifty-seven kilns; at East Liverpool, forty-six; at Cincinnati, twelve; at Flushing and Greenpoint, Long Island, eleven; at Pittsburg six; or there are at sixteen seats of the industry, and excluding terra-cotta manufactories, one hundred and seventy kilns. The capital invested by the forty firms, members of the Potters' Association, is upward of four millions, an amount vastly increased by the remaining seven hundred and thirty odd establishments throughout the country. White granite-ware, an abomination in point of art, but eminently useful, is made at other places in this country besides Trenton in great abundance. The only manufactory of white granite and cream-colored ware in the Eastern States is that of the New England Pottery Company at East Boston. It was established in 85/84. A display was made at the Centennial Exhibition of what was called 'Ivory Porcelain,' from the Etruria Pottery of Ott & Brewer, Trenton. It has a hard, semi-translucent body, and clear, smooth boracic glaze. It bears a close resemblance to Mr. Carr's semi-china, and is substantially the same ware that is now receiving attention from many of the other Trenton potters. It may be said to mark the first stage on the way to a true American porcelain. By exhibiting it at the Centennial Exhibition, Ott & Brewer were really the first to draw the public attention to this new departure in American manufacture. Its distinctive name is taken from its soft, ivory-like tint. The advantages claimed for it are, that while it answers all the purposes of china, its manufacture is less expensive, and permits its being put upon the market at a much lower price; that it equals the average china in point of both utility and appearance; and that its consistency is such that it can be made into more graceful or less clumsy shapes than granite. Experience alone can dispose of these claims. It is fired, like granite-ware, hard in the biscuit and soft in the gloss-kiln, from which it would appear that the glaze and paste are not homogeneous, as in natural porcelain. Practically, however, this new ware represents a great and substantial improvement in the manufacture of a general domestic article. All the component ingredients of both paste and glaze are found in America. At Ott & Brewer's, also, are to be discovered the first glimmerings of what may be called an art, in the studio of Mr. Isaac Broome, an American artist of considerable repute and skill. Mr. Broome devoted himself to both painting and sculpture before turning his attention to ceramic art. Some years ago he established a terra-cotta workshop in Pittsburg; but the locality was unfavorable, and the enterprise was abandoned. A similar venture in New York city also failed. Several months prior to the Centennial Exhibition he was employed by Messrs. Ott & Brewer to design and model certain works in parian. These were exhibited at Philadelphia, and were very favorably received. The improved kiln previously built after his plans, and under his personal direction for firing the works turned out of his studio. Of these one of the best was suggested by Mr. J. Hart Brewer, and consists pair of vases in parian designed to illustrate the national game of base-ball. Great variety of detail is attained without detriment to a certain severity of outline. From a narrow base the body contracts quickly to its smallest girth, and thence expands gradually to the top. Round the foot of each vase, and standing on the supporting pedestal, are arranged three figures of base-ball players, modelled after a thoroughly American ideal of physical beauty, embodying muscular activity rather than ponderous strength. The attitudes are very well chosen, and invest the figures with an appearance of life and vigorous action. A series of clubs belted round with a strap ornaments the stem of the vases, and some exquisitely wrought leaves and berries are woven round the top. The orifice is covered by a cupola or dome, composed of a segment of a base-ball, upon which stands an eagle. These vases are the work of a genuine artist, who has surrounded a general design of great merit with many finely executed and suggestive details. The same artist's 'rustic,' or 'Pastoral,' a different order of ideas. Here the surface is covered with mouldings in relief, composing a design partly suggested by mythology, partly original. It carries us back to the golden age of the poets. A female figure, which might be that of Flora or Proserpina, dances to a satyr who plays a musical instrument. The details are all in perfect harmony--the dancing goats, the grape-vines, the leaves, rustic wood-work, and goat's-head handles. A tasteful finish is given to the decoration by a fluting running round the upper part of the neck to the lip. To produce a good effect, work of this kind, all in relief and uncolored, demands the nicest finish, and a design which shall lean neither toward scantiness on the one hand, nor overloaded ornamentation on the other. In both respects Mr. Broome has been fortunate. The decoration relieves without destroying the fine outline of the vase. Mr. Broome's 'Fashion' embellished with some very fine illustrations of the fashions of a century ago and also of the present time. Of these the shapes are exceedingly quaint and uncommon, and the figures in low relief are very highly finished. Besides these, Mr. Broome has modelled a great number of the heads and busts which have always been the staple of workers in parian. Some are original, others are reproductions from the antique. To the former class belongs an ideal Cleopatra . The artist has chosen a full and sensuous type of beauty, vastly different from that adopted by recent painters who have ventured to portray upon canvas the charms which melted the stern Csar and enslaved Antony. Somehow one associates the style of beauty represented in Mr. Broome's bust rather generally with the land of Egypt than specially with the conquests of Cleopatra. This may result from a familiarity with less truthful conceptions, and in that view implies a decided merit. The artist has in details followed history as closely as it seems possible for him to have done, and has wisely preferred study and research to giving his imagination a free rein. Imagination, or an American model, might have led him to present a higher type of beauty, but neither would have led him to produce a distinctively Egyptian Cleopatra. Accepting his ideal, it is worked out with unmistakable talent, and with the most painstaking attention to workmanship. It is unnecessary to particularize farther. The Etruria Pottery Company have made a good beginning, and in directing the efforts of their artists it is to be hoped that they may not allow the commercial success of copies of the antique to divert attention from such works as those described. The paste employed is fine, compact, and hard, and assumes in some pieces the clear and polished appearance of marble. Its precise composition is not known. The paste is, as in the usual case, poured in a fluid state into plaster moulds, which absorb the superfluous water. Oxides are used to vary the color of the casts, and a number of tints of great delicacy and beauty have been secured. American terra-cotta must be briefly dismissed. At the Centennial Exhibition an extensive assortment was shown from works situated in many parts of the country.""","""American pottery and ceramic art""","1981","""American pottery and ceramic art hold a rich history and enduring legacy that spans centuries, reflecting cultural influences and artistic innovations. From the Native American pottery traditions to contemporary studio ceramics, the evolution of pottery in America is a fascinating tapestry of creativity and craftsmanship.  The roots of American pottery can be traced back to the indigenous peoples who inhabited the land long before European settlers arrived. Native American tribes such as the Pueblo, Hopi, Navajo, and others developed distinctive pottery styles characterized by intricate designs, earthy colors, and spiritual significance. These traditional pottery techniques and aesthetics continue to influence contemporary American ceramic artists, blending ancient traditions with modern interpretations.  One of the most iconic periods in American pottery history is the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Influenced by the philosophy of handcrafted goods and the revival of traditional craftsmanship, artists like George Ohr, Adelaide Robineau, and Rookwood Pottery's artisans created exceptional pieces that combined artistic expression with functional utility. The Arts and Crafts movement laid the foundation for the studio pottery movement that emerged in the mid-20th century.  The post-World War II era witnessed a resurgence of interest in studio ceramics, with artists like Peter Voulkos, Beatrice Wood, and Warren MacKenzie pushing the boundaries of clay as a medium for artistic expression. Voulkos, known for his bold and innovative approach to ceramics, transformed the traditional perception of pottery, elevating it to a form of abstract expressionism. Beatrice Wood, on the other hand, embraced the whimsical and eccentric in her work, infusing her pieces with a sense of playfulness and originality.  The 20th century also saw the rise of functional pottery in America, with artists like Warren MacKenzie and Otto and Gertrud Natzler gaining prominence for their mastery of form, texture, and glazing techniques. MacKenzie, in particular, is revered for his simple yet elegant stoneware vessels that embody the beauty of everyday objects. The Natzlers, known for their intricate and experimental glazes, brought a new level of sophistication to American ceramics, blending form and surface treatment with exceptional skill.  Contemporary American ceramic artists continue to push the boundaries of the medium, exploring new techniques, forms, and concepts. Artists like Betty Woodman, Ron Nagle, and Kathy Butterly challenge conventional notions of pottery, using clay as a sculptural medium to create provocative and visually stunning artworks. Woodman's vibrant and oversized clay sculptures blur the line between pottery and sculpture, while Nagle's small-scale pieces convey a sense of whimsy and surrealism. Butterly's intricate and colorful vessels invite viewers to explore the intersection of form and decoration.  In recent years, American pottery and ceramic art have gained greater recognition and appreciation in the art world, with museums and galleries showcasing the work of both established and emerging artists. Events like the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts (NCECA) conference provide a platform for artists, educators, and enthusiasts to exchange ideas, techniques, and inspiration, further enriching the vibrant community of ceramic artists in America.  American pottery and ceramic art continue to evolve and captivate audiences with their diversity, innovation, and artistic vision. From the traditional techniques of Native American pottery to the avant-garde experiments of contemporary artists, the legacy of American ceramics remains a testament to the enduring power of clay as a medium for creative expression.""","693"
"Colcord Joanna C  Joanna Carver ","""The solution had finally to be institutional care for the entire family, Mrs. Laflin in a hospital for incurables, Mr. Laflin in a home for the aged, and their two young daughters, through the interest of a former employer, in a good convent school. 'Uncomplicated' non-support, as in the case of Mr. Laflin, is, however, rare in the experience of the social worker. Out of a group of 1 non-supporters selected at random from the records of the Buffalo Charity Organization Society in 917, 6 showed some serious moral fault other than non-support. Alcoholism is probably the commonest of these complications; and, as has been pointed out in the previous chapter, is probably a primary cause as well. It will be a matter of great interest to social workers whether the 'non-support rate' is reduced after July, 919. Grounds for hope that it may be are found in the fact that some remarkable results have been obtained by moving alcoholic non-supporters and their families from 'wet' into 'dry' territory. Another vice that has a direct relation to non- gambling. The gambler carries no signs of his vice upon his person as does the inebriate, and it is therefore hard to detect. It undoubtedly does not appear in social case records as frequently as it should. Case workers should have it in mind as a possible explanation, whenever there is a marked discrepancy between what a non-supporter earns and what he contributes to the home. With the non-supporters rather than with the deserters should be put the group of men whose wives tire of supporting them and either put them out or leave them. These men are often not only morally, but mentally and physically, so handicapped that there is nothing to be gained by constantly pursuing and arresting them, although some wives extract the sweets of revenge from doing just this. Few courts of domestic relations are without some wives as regular patrons who pursue their husbands not for gain but for sport. For the most part, however, the wives of such men are philosophical. 'I only wash for meself now,' said one of them. These men, and the unreclaimed deserters, doubtless make up a large part of the floating population of homeless men in our large cities. How large a part it is impossible to say, for they are likely to give assumed names and deny the possession of families. Mrs. Solenberger has noted, however, that if they are asked, not 'Are you married?' but a less direct question such as 'Where is your wife now?' a story of unfortunate married life will often be elicited. Until we have some better method of inter-city registration of homeless men, many of these who otherwise might be identified and in suitable cases brought back, will continue to slip through our fingers. With non-support in an incipient stage, it is sometimes possible to deal so suddenly and effectively that the man is shocked into a better realization of his responsibilities. A young Irish rigger, with a capable wife and two pretty babies, lost his job after a quarrel with his boss rigger. He was a genial, popular chap, always 'the life of the party' in his circle; and his companions encouraged him to feel that he was a much injured man. They also helped him to fill his enforced leisure with too much beer. When the family received a dispossess notice the wife's patience was at an end, and acting on the advice of a society engaged in family case work, she put the furniture in storage and went to a shelter where she could leave her children in the daytime, while she was at work, and have them with her at night. The man was told to shift for himself until he could get together sufficient money to re-establish the home. The arrangement continued for nearly two months, during which the man lived in lodging houses, had an attack of stomach trouble, and was altogether thoroughly miserable. Every night he waited for a word with his wife on a corner that she had to pass in coming from work. Finally, when it seemed to the social worker and to the wife that his lesson had gone far enough, the home was re-established, with only a small amount of help from the society. During the five years since that time, no recurrence of the trouble has come to the attention of the agency interested. This experiment was realized to be a ticklish one, as a man less sincerely attached to his home might have been turned into a vagabond by such treatment. In general, it may be said that, as there is less to work on constructively with the non-supporter, court action has more often to be invoked. If the non-supporter is a 'chronic,' his path must not be allowed to be too easy. 'Sometimes you just have to keep pestering him' was the way one social worker put it. A Red Cross Home Service worker successfully shocked one elderly non-supporter into going to work, as described in one of the Red Cross publications: 'Well, Mr. Gage,' I said, 'I see you're not working yet.' 'No, Mrs. Cox, the coal company promised to send for me.' 'Well,' I said, 'I think you've been pretty fair with that company. You've waited on it for three months now. If I had the offer of another job I'd feel perfectly free to take it, if I were you.' 'Yes,' he said, 'I think I should.' 'All right, I have a job for you,' said I. 'My husband wants a man now at his garage, to clean automobiles. The hours are from p.m. to a.m., and you'll earn $5/8 a week.' His paper fell from his hands to the floor; his jaw dropped, and he just looked at me. Then he tried to crawl out of it and began to make excuses. 'I haven't time to argue with you, Mr. Gage,' I said. 'I'll keep the job open till seven o'clock tonight and you can let me know then whether you'll take it or not.' At seven he came to say he'd take the job. If in desertion cases the interest centers very vividly about the absent man, in non-support cases the reverse is likely to be true, because he is often not very interesting per se, and because, moreover, he is always on the spot and does not have to be searched for. Familiarity certainly breeds contempt for the non-supporter. Consequently the social worker may easily fall into the danger of disregarding the human factors he presents, and either treating the family as if he did not exist or expending no further effort on him than to see that he 'puts in' six months of every year in jail if possible (since the law usually secures to him the privilege of loafing the other six). It is not safe, however, to regard even the most leisurely of non-supporters as beyond the possibility of awakening. One district secretary who had thus given a man up had the experience of seeing him transformed into a steady worker after a few months of intensive effort by a first-year student in a school of social science, whose only equipment for the job was personality and enthusiasm. So remarkable are some of the reclamations that have been brought about with seemingly hopeless non-supporters that all possible measures should be tried before giving one of them up. His Scotch ancestry, a good wife, luck, and a friend with insight and skill, pulled Aleck Gray out of that bottomless pit, the gutter. Aleck had been a bookkeeper; but he didn't get on well with his employers, lost his job, got to drinking, and went so far downhill that his wife had to take their two children and go home to her people several hundred miles away. Aleck finally drifted into a bureau for homeless men, where the agent became interested in him and worked with him for six months, getting him job after job, which he always lost through drink or temper. He seemed incapable of taking directions or working with other people. In all that time the agent felt that he was getting no nearer the root of Aleck's trouble, though he came back after each dismissal and doggedly took whatever was offered. Finally, the agent's patience wore thin, and when Aleck had been more than usually dour and aggravating it went entirely to pieces. Aleck listened to his outburst apparently unmoved; then said, 'Very well, if you want to know what would make me stop drinking, I'll tell you. If I could see any ray of hope that I was on the way to getting my home and family back, I'd stop and stop quick.' On the agent's desk there happened to be a letter from a friend who wanted a tenant farmer. He thrust it into Aleck's hand saying, 'There's your chance if you mean what you say.' The man's reply was to ask when he could get a train. At the end of several weeks Aleck wrote that he had not drunk a drop and was making good, which was enthusiastically confirmed by his employer. He begged the agent to intercede with his wife, and a letter went to her which brought the telegraphic reply, 'Starting tomorrow.' How they got through the first winter the agent never knew exactly. But they pulled through and the next year was easy, as country-born Aleck's skill came back. Six years later, during which time the agent heard from them once or twice a year, Aleck was still keeping straight, the children were doing well in school, and the family, prosperous and happy, had bought a farm of their own in another state.: The deserter who does not fail to support is usually safe from punishment no matter how aggravated his offense. A man living with his wife and five-year-old boy in an eastern city eloped with another woman to a city in the Middle West. The couple kidnapped the boy and took him with them; and the distracted woman, bereft of both her husband and child, had no recourse in any court, since the father was continuing to provide for his son.

This phenomenon can have significant implications on the well-being and functioning of the family unit as a whole. Understanding the causes, effects, and ways to address non-support within family dynamics is crucial in fostering healthier relationships and creating a supportive environment for all family members involved.  One of the key causes of non-support within families is communication breakdown. Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and a lack of emotional connection among family members, thereby impeding their ability to offer support when needed. Additionally, conflicting values, beliefs, and expectations within the family can also contribute to non-supportive behaviors. Differences in opinions on how to show care and support may lead to family members feeling unsupported or unappreciated.  Moreover, individual challenges such as stress, mental health issues, substance abuse, or financial constraints can hinder a family member's ability to provide support to others. When one family member is struggling with their own issues, they may not have the capacity to offer adequate support to other family members, creating a cycle of non-support within the family.  The effects of non-support within family dynamics can be profound and long-lasting. Family members who do not receive the expected support may experience feelings of isolation, loneliness, and resentment. This lack of support can impact their mental health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. In cases where children are involved, non-supportive family dynamics can have detrimental effects on their emotional development and create a sense of instability and insecurity.  Furthermore, non-support within family dynamics can strain relationships and create tension among family members. Resentment and unresolved conflicts may arise, leading to further breakdowns in communication and trust. Over time, this can weaken the family unit, erode the sense of belonging and cohesion, and ultimately result in fragmented relationships within the family.  Addressing non-support within family dynamics requires proactive efforts from all family members involved. Cultivating open and honest communication is essential in addressing misunderstandings, resolving conflicts, and building stronger connections within the family. Encouraging empathy and active listening can help family members better understand each other's perspectives and needs, fostering a supportive environment where everyone feels valued and cared for.  Setting boundaries and realistic expectations within the family can also help manage potential conflicts and reduce instances of non-support. Clarifying roles and responsibilities, as well as discussing ways to offer and receive support, can create a sense of structure and mutual understanding among family members.  Seeking external support from family therapy, counseling, or community resources can also be beneficial in addressing non-support within family dynamics. Professional intervention can provide a neutral space for family members to express their concerns, learn effective communication strategies, and work towards rebuilding trust and support within the family.  Ultimately, fostering a culture of support within family dynamics requires a collective effort from all family members. By prioritizing empathy, understanding, and effective communication, families can create a nurturing and supportive environment where each member feels valued, respected, and cared for. Investing time and effort in strengthening family relationships can lead to healthier dynamics, improved well-being, and a sense of unity within the family unit.""","641"
"Koller Armin Hajman 1878 ","""Cesare Lombroso, who is claimed to be the first to have essayed to portray the effect of physical environment on the human psyche, states in his Criminal Man, referring to Ferri and Holzendorf, that with high temperature there is an increase in crimes of violence, while low temperature has the effect of increasing the number of crimes against property. In comparing statistics of criminality in France with those of the variations in temperature, Ferri noted an increase in crimes of violence during the warmer years. Lombroso, in his Crime, Its Causes and Remedies, citing the conclusions of the relevant statistical evidence, establishes that in England and France and Italy the crimes of rape and of murder occur in greatest number in the hottest months; that the maximum number of all rebellions in the whole world between 791 and 880 falls everywhere in the hottest month, while its minimum number comes in the coldest months; and that crimes against property markedly increase in the winter.

As global temperatures rise and weather patterns become more unpredictable, communities are facing new challenges that can contribute to an increase in criminal activities.  One of the most direct ways that climate change affects crime rates is through extreme weather events. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires can displace populations, disrupt infrastructure, and strain resources, creating ideal conditions for crime to flourish. In the aftermath of such disasters, there is often a surge in looting, theft, and fraud as people struggle to meet their basic needs.  Moreover, the economic consequences of climate change can also lead to higher crime rates. Crop failures, water scarcity, and loss of livelihoods in agriculture and fisheries can push individuals towards illegal activities such as poaching, illegal logging, or drug production and trafficking to make ends meet. Unemployment and financial instability resulting from climate-related disasters can also drive people to engage in criminal behavior as a means of survival.  Additionally, the psychological impacts of climate change cannot be underestimated when considering its influence on crime rates. As communities grapple with the stress and trauma of witnessing environmental degradation and natural disasters, mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder can become more prevalent. These conditions can contribute to an increase in violent behaviors, substance abuse, and domestic violence within communities.  It is important to note that marginalized and vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by both the impacts of climate change and the increase in crime rates. Low-income communities, indigenous peoples, and minority groups often bear the brunt of environmental degradation and lack the resources to adequately protect themselves from its consequences. As a result, they are more likely to resort to criminal activities or become victims of crime in the face of climate-related challenges.  To address the intersection of climate change and crime rates, holistic approaches are needed. Investing in community resilience, providing support for mental health services, creating sustainable livelihood opportunities, and implementing effective disaster response mechanisms are crucial steps towards mitigating the impact of climate change on crime rates. Additionally, addressing the root causes of climate change through sustainable development practices and environmental conservation is essential for long-term crime prevention efforts.  In conclusion, climate change is not only an environmental issue but also a social and security concern due to its influence on crime rates. By recognizing the complex interplay between these factors and taking proactive measures to build resilient communities, we can work towards a more sustainable and secure future for all.""","500"
"Ostrander Stephen M ","""During the time the Common Council met in the City Buildings, Whigs and Democrats were very belligerent. The cause of the trouble grew out of the election for Alderman of the seventh ward. That ward then embraced the area of the present seventh, eleventh, nineteenth, and twentieth wards. The charter election was held in the public schoolhouse on Classen Avenue, between Flushing and Park avenues, on the 1th of March, 843, and resulted in a tie between John A. Cross and Zebulon Chadbourne, the former being a Whig and the latter a Democrat. A protracted lawsuit followed. Albert H. Osborn, whose seat was to be filled, held over, and ever after the people declared that his initials, A. H. O., stood for Alderman Hold Over. The contention ran high, and bitterness and rancor marked the deliberations of the Aldermen. At a regular meeting of the Board, held at the City Buildings May, a separation took place between the Whig and Democratic members, occasioned by the fight between Cross and Chadbourne for the seat from the seventh ward. The Whig members retired to Hull's Exchange Buildings, whilst the Democrats remained in possession of the City Buildings, and made their appointments. The Whigs did the same. On the 5/8th of May a writ of mandamus was served on Alfred G. Stevens, who had been appointed clerk of the Common Council by the Democrats May. His election was secured by the vote of A. H. Osborne, without whose holding over the Board would have been a tie. On the 3d of May the mandamus which had been obtained by Worthington Hodgkinson, the clerk appointed by the Whigs, was argued before the Supreme Court. On the th of July, 843, the motion to displace Stevens and substitute Hodgkinson was decided and denied by the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Nelson and Greene C. Bronson presiding. The decision did not suit the Whigs, and was carried to the Supreme Court at Albany, and argued October 1, 843. Abraham Crist appeared for the relator, and John Greenwood for the defendant. Shortly afterwards the court decided in favor of the defendant. The matter was again argued November 4 before Judge Kent in New York, on a motion to obtain the books and papers of the Common Council in the hands of Mr. Stevens. On the 7th Judge Kent again decided in favor of Mr. Stevens. On the st of December the Whig Aldermen were arrested for misdemeanor in neglecting to perform their duty. The complaint was abandoned. On the th of December the grand jury found bills of indictment against the several Whig Aldermen for neglecting to serve as members of the Common Council. At this time Seth the fourth ward in the Common Council. The indictment against the Whig Aldermen grew out of an effort on their part to indict Mayor Sprague. It was a case of the biter being bitten. The grand jury refused to indict the Mayor, and indicted his accusers. The indictment was, however, not pressed to trial. Meanwhile the Jamaica Railroad had obtained permission to occupy Atlantic Street, and other projects matured. The population of the city had, in 835/8, reached 4,10, showing a gain of 013 in fifteen years. Trotter was reelected Mayor, and was succeeded by Jeremiah Johnson, a man whose contemporaries revered him, and whose name occupies, and must always occupy, a high place in the annals of the city. General Johnson was reelected, and was succeeded by Cyrus P. Smith, who was elected by vote of the people, and who also was reelected. The fluster in the real-estate market was paralleled by the financial excitement, which resulted in the suspension of specie payments by the three banks of the city. The year of General Johnson's reelection was one of general business depression, but the community rallied quickly from the blow inflicted by disordered markets. In 841 the Democrats of the county received representation in a new newspaper, the 'Brooklyn Eagle and Kings County Democrat.' The movement for the establishment of the 'Eagle' was led by Henry C. Murphy, with whom Richard Adams Locke was associated in the editorship. The first number appeared in October, and the Democrats were not loth to give the lusty young journal full credit for the success of the campaign, in which its voice gave no uncertain sound. Directing the helm of the 'Eagle' enterprise was the clear-sighted, practical genius of Isaac Van Anden, who soon came into complete control of the paper, and remained sole proprietor until the year 872. The 'Eagle' had its days of adversity; but it had a field, and it had vitality, and its growth was sure and steady. Following Murphy in its early editorship were William B. Marsh, Walt Whitman, S. G. Arnold (under whose editorial leadership the name of the paper was abbreviated to 'Brooklyn Daily Eagle'), and Henry McCloskey. In 861 McCloskey was succeeded by Thomas Kinsella, who gave force and distinction to the editorial page of the flourishing paper. Kinsella died in 884, after having made himself a power in the community. He was succeeded by his first lieutenant on the 'Eagle' staff, that graceful writer and orator, Andrew McLean, who afterward took the editorship of the Brooklyn 'Citizen.' That the 'Eagle' was destined to be lucky with its editors, received further indication in the appearance of St. Clair McKelway at the post of command. Mr. McKelway's brilliant gifts as a speaker and as a writer have given to him peculiar prominence in the social, artistic, and political life of the city and the State. The policy of the 'Eagle' has been independently Democratic from the outset, a policy which has fostered, as it has been favored by, a singularly representative constituency. The paper is now controlled by the Eagle Association, of which Colonel William Hester is the president, William Van Anden Hester is secretary, and Harry S. Kingsley is treasurer. Its business management, like its editorial management,--if these may consistently be separated,--has been aggressive and liberal, and goes far toward explaining the present national reputation of the paper. Henry C. Murphy, who had, as we have seen, taken so important a part in the starting of the 'Eagle,' was a young Democrat of prominence in the county. Born in the village of Brooklyn, Murphy had been educated at Columbia College, where he distinguished himself as a writer as well as in general scholarship, and was admitted to the bar in 833. During his student years, he had taken part in debates in the Young Men's Literary Association, which afterward became the Hamilton Literary Association, with Murphy as president. To this association belongs the honor of popularizing the lyceum lecture system, which afterward became so potent a factor in American civilization, and which in this city represented the beginning of the Brooklyn Lyceum and the Brooklyn Institute. In 834 he was appointed assistant corporation counsel of the city, and in the following year he formed a legal partnership with the leading lawyer of the city, John A. Lott. This firm, which Judge Vanderbilt afterward joined, won great influence in the city, with whose early politics it was so closely connected. In 842 Murphy was chosen Mayor of Brooklyn. He was then but thirty years of age. His administration was forcible throughout, and consistently resulted in his election to Congress, of which he was one of the youngest members. He was a candidate for reelection, but was defeated by Henry L. Seaman. In the State Constitutional Convention of 846, he was a delegate from Kings County, with Tunis G. Bergen and Conrad Schwackhammer, and in the autumn of the same year he was again elected to Congress by a large vote. Upon the election of Buchanan, Murphy was appointed Minister to the Hague. On his return to this country he was elected to the state Senate as an avowed champion of the Union cause. In the later political life of Brooklyn, Murphy took an active interest; and local enterprises, such as the bridge and various railroads, claimed his attention and support. He made important historical collections, wrote valuable contributions to local history, edited the 'Journal' of Dankers and Sluyter, and was a leader in the establishment of the Long Island Historical Society. Murphy was succeeded as Mayor of Brooklyn by Joseph Sprague. The city had now 0,00 population, and thirty-five miles of paved and lighted streets. The Atlantic Dock Company had been incorporated. Thirty-five churches opened their doors on Sunday. A line of stages ran from the ferry to East Brooklyn, and soon afterward a line was established between Fulton and South ferries. In the year of Sprague's election 70 new buildings were finished or in course of erection. During Sprague's second term the Brooklyn City Hospital was incorporated. Sprague was succeeded by Thomas G. Talmadge, who was followed by Francis Burdett Stryker. In March, 848, gaslight came into use. It was in the same year that Augustus Graham indelibly wrote his name in the annals of Brooklyn, by his munificent gifts to the Brooklyn City Hospital, and to the establishment of the Brooklyn Institute in the building on Washington Street built for the Brooklyn Lyceum. A fire which took place in September destroyed three churches, the post-office, two newspaper offices, and other property to the value of a million and a half of dollars, and might have been more disastrous had not the flames been checked by the destruction of buildings in their path. Edward Copeland was elected Mayor in 849. Cypress Hills Cemetery had been established in 848. In the following year the Cemetery of the Evergreens was incorporated.""","""Political conflict in Brooklyn's history""","2036","""Political conflict has been a prevailing theme in Brooklyn's rich history, shaping the borough's identity and influencing its development over the years. From early disputes over land ownership to modern-day debates over gentrification and social justice issues, Brooklyn has been a battleground for competing interests and ideologies. Understanding the political conflicts in Brooklyn requires delving into its historical context and examining how they have evolved over time.  In the 17th century, Brooklyn was a Dutch settlement known as Breuckelen, characterized by conflicts between Dutch settlers and indigenous Lenape tribes over land ownership and trade. The Dutch West India Company controlled the area, imposing their authority on the Native American population through treaties and agreements that often led to disputes and clashes. These early conflicts set the stage for the power struggles and tensions that would define Brooklyn's political landscape for centuries to come.  As Brooklyn grew into a diverse and bustling urban center in the 19th and early 20th centuries, political conflict intensified along ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic lines. The influx of immigrants from Europe, particularly Irish and Italian communities, brought new layers of complexity to Brooklyn's political scene. Neighborhoods became battlegrounds for competing political factions, with tensions running high between various groups vying for power and resources.  One significant political conflict in Brooklyn's history was the battle over public education in the late 19th century. The establishment of a public school system in Brooklyn sparked controversy, as different groups fought over issues such as curriculum, funding, and control. Religious and ethnic divisions further fueled the conflict, with debates over whether schools should promote specific values or cater to the diverse needs of the community. These tensions culminated in protests, strikes, and legal battles that highlighted the deep-seated divisions within Brooklyn's political landscape.  The early 20th century saw the rise of labor movements and social justice activism in Brooklyn, leading to new forms of political conflict. Workers' rights, racial equality, and gender equality became central issues, sparking protests, strikes, and demonstrations across the borough. The Great Depression exacerbated these tensions, as economic hardship and social inequality fueled discontent and resistance among Brooklyn's diverse population. Political factions clashed over how to address these pressing issues, creating a polarized and tumultuous environment.  In the mid-20th century, Brooklyn underwent significant demographic shifts due to urban renewal projects, suburbanization, and the civil rights movement. These changes brought new challenges and tensions to the forefront, as communities grappled with issues of segregation, inequality, and political representation. The civil rights movement in particular sparked heated debates and conflicts over racial equality, police brutality, and systemic discrimination, with Brooklyn serving as a microcosm of the larger national struggle for social justice.  The late 20th and early 21st centuries witnessed ongoing political conflicts in Brooklyn, particularly in the realms of gentrification, affordable housing, and environmental justice. As the borough experienced rapid gentrification and redevelopment, long-time residents found themselves displaced and marginalized, leading to protests, activism, and community organizing efforts. Gentrification became a focal point for political conflict, with debates over zoning laws, development projects, and economic disparities fueling tensions within Brooklyn's diverse neighborhoods.  Environmental justice also emerged as a critical issue in Brooklyn, as communities of color faced disproportionate exposure to pollution, industrial waste, and environmental hazards. Political conflicts over environmental racism and sustainability highlighted deep-seated inequalities and power imbalances that shaped the borough's physical and social landscape. Activists, residents, and policymakers clashed over how to address these environmental injustices, leading to grassroots movements and political campaigns aimed at promoting equitable policies and practices.  Overall, political conflict has been a recurring theme in Brooklyn's history, reflecting the complex interplay of power, identity, and ideology in shaping the borough's trajectory. From early disputes over land ownership to modern-day debates over social justice and gentrification, Brooklyn's political conflicts have been instrumental in defining its character and fostering community resilience. By understanding the roots and evolution of these conflicts, we can gain insight into the challenges and opportunities facing Brooklyn as it continues to navigate its political terrain in the years to come.""","824"
"Eddy Mary Baker","""Man has an immortal Soul, a divine Principle, and an eternal being. Man has perpetual individuality; and God's laws, and their intelligent and harmonious action, constitute his individuality in the Science of Soul. In its literary expression, my system of Christian metaphysics is hampered by material terms, which must be used to indicate thoughts that are to be understood metaphysically. As a Science, this system is held back by the common ignorance of what it is and what it does, those who come falsely in its name. To be appreciated, Science must be understood and conscientiously introduced. If the Bible and Science and Health had the place in schools of learning that physiology occupies, they would revolutionize and reform the world, through the power of Christ. It is true that it requires more study to understand and demonstrate what these works teach, than to learn theology, physiology, or physics; because they teach divine Science, with fixed Principle, given rule, and unmistakable proof. Ancient and modern human philosophy are inadequate to grasp the Principle of Christian Science, or to demonstrate it. Revelation shows this Principle, and will rescue reason from the thrall of error. Revelation must subdue the sophistry of intellect, and spiritualize consciousness with the dictum and the demonstration of Truth and Love. Christian Science Mind-healing can only be gained by working from a purely Christian standpoint. Then it heals the sick and exalts the race. The essence of this Science is right thinking and right acting--leading us to see spirituality and to be spiritual, to understand and to demonstrate God. The Massachusetts Metaphysical College and Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, were the outgrowth of the author's religious experience. After a lifetime of orthodoxy on the platform of doctrines, rites, and ceremonies, it became a sacred duty for her to impart to others this new-old knowledge of God. The same affection, desire, and motives which have stimulated true Christianity in all ages, and given impulse to goodness, in or out of the Church, have nerved her purpose to build on the new-born conception of the Christ, as Jesus declared himself,--namely, 'the way, the truth, and the life.' Living a true life, casting out evil, healing the sick, and preaching the gospel of Truth,--these are the ends of Christianity. This divine way impels a spiritualization of thought and method, beyond doctrine and ritual; and in nothing else has she departed from the old landmarks. The unveiled spiritual signification of the Word so enlarges our sense of God that it makes both sense and Soul, man and Life, immaterial, though still individual. It removes all limits from divine power. God must be found all instead of a part of being, and man the reflection of His power and goodness. This Science rebukes sin with its own nothingness, and thus destroys sin quickly and utterly. It makes disease unreal, and this heals it. The demonstration of moral and physical growth, and a scientific deduction from the Principle of all harmony, declare both the Principle and idea to be divine. If this be true, then death must be swallowed up in Life, and the prophecy of Jesus fulfilled, 'Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.' Though centuries passed after those words were originally uttered, before this reappearing of Truth, and though the hiatus be longer still before that saying is demonstrated in Life that knows no death, the declaration is nevertheless true, and remains a clear and profound deduction from Christian Science. IS OF THE SAME AS OR? Science is not susceptible of being held as a mere theory. It is hoary with time. It takes hold of eternity, voices the infinite, and governs the universe. No greater opposites can be conceived of, physically, morally, and spiritually, than Christian Science, spiritualism, and theosophy. Science and Health has effected a revolution in the minds of thinkers on the subject of mediumship, and given impulse to reason and revelation, goodness and virtue. A theory may be sound in spots, and sparkle like a diamond, while other parts of it have no lustre. Christian Science is sound in every part. It is neither warped nor misconceived, when properly demonstrated. If a spiritualist medium understood the Science of Mind-healing, he would know that between those who have and those who have not passed the transition called death, there can be no interchange of consciousness, and that all sensible phenomena are merely subjective states of mortal mind. Theosophy is a corruption of Judaism. This corruption had a renewal in the Neoplatonic philosophy; but it sprang from the Oriental philosophy of Brahmanism, and blends with its magic and enchantments. Theosophy is no more allied to Christian Science than the odor of the upas-tree is to the sweet breath of springtide, or the brilliant coruscations of the northern sky are to solar heat and light. IS FROM, AND NOT FROM? Hear the words of our Master: 'Go ye into all the world'! 'Heal the sick, cast out devils'! Christian Scientists, perhaps more than any other religious sect, are obeying these commands; and the injunctions are not confined to Jesus' students in that age, but they extend to this age,--to as many as shall believe on him. The demand and example of Jesus were not from beneath. Are frozen dogmas, persistent persecution, and the doctrine of eternal damnation, from above? Are the dews of divine Truth, falling on the sick and sinner, to heal them, from beneath? 'By their fruits ye shall know them.' Reading my books, without prejudice, would convince all that their purpose is right. The comprehension of my teachings would enable any one to prove these books to be filled with blessings for the whole human family. Fatiguing Bible translations and voluminous commentaries are employed to explain and prop old creeds, and they have the civil and religious arms in their defense; then why should not these be equally extended to support the Christianity that heals the sick? The notions of personality to be found in creeds are far more mystic than Mind-healing. It is no easy matter to believe there are three persons in one person, and that one person is cast out of another person. These conceptions of Deity and devil presuppose an impotent God and an incredible Satan. IS? Christian Science refutes pantheism, finds Spirit neither in matter nor in the modes of mortal mind. It shows that matter and mortal mind have neither origin nor existence in the eternal Mind. Thinking otherwise is what estranges mortals from divine Life and Love. God is All-in-all. He is Spirit; and in nothing is He unlike Himself. Nothing that 'worketh or maketh a lie' is to be found in the divine consciousness. For God to know, is to be; that is, what He knows must truly and eternally exist. If He knows matter, and matter can exist in Mind, then mortality and discord must be eternal. He is Mind; and whatever He knows is made manifest, and must be Truth. If God knows evil even as a false claim, this knowledge would manifest evil in Him and proceeding from Him. Christian Science shows that matter, evil, sin, sickness, and death are but negations of Spirit, Truth, and Life, which are positives that cannot be gainsaid. The subjective states of evil, called mortal mind or matter, are negatives destitute of time and space; for there is none beside God or Spirit and the idea of Spirit. This infinite logic is the infinite light,--uncomprehended, yet forever giving forth more light, because it has no darkness to emit. Mortals do not understand the All; hence their inference of some other existence beside God and His true likeness,--of something unlike Him. He who is All, understands all. He can have no knowledge or inference but His own consciousness, and can take in no more than all. The mists of matter--sin, sickness, and death--disappear in proportion as mortals approach Spirit, which is the reality of being. It is not enough to say that matter is the substratum of evil, and that its highest attenuation is mortal mind; for there is, strictly speaking, no mortal mind. Mind is immortal. Death is the consequent of an antecedent false assumption of the realness of something unreal, material, and mortal. If God knows the antecedent, He must produce its consequences. From this logic there is no escape. Matter, or evil, is the absence of Spirit or good. Their nothingness is thus proven; for God is good, ever-present, and All. 'In Him we live, and move, and have our being;' consequently it is impossible for the true man--who is a spiritual and individual being, created in the eternal Science of being--to be conscious of aught but good. God's image and likeness can never be less than a good man; and for man to be more than God's likeness is impossible. Man is the climax of creation; and God is not without an ever-present witness, testifying of Himself. Matter, or any mode of mortal mind, is neither part nor parcel of divine consciousness and God's verity. In Science there is no fallen state of being; for therein is no inverted image of God, no escape from the focal radiation of the infinite. Hence the unreality of error, and the truth of the Scripture, that there is 'none beside Him.' If mortals could grasp these two words all and nothing, this mystery of a God who has no knowledge of sin would disappear, and the eternal, infinite harmony would be fathomed. If God could know a false claim, false knowledge would be a part of His consciousness. Then evil would be as real as good, sickness as real as health, death as real as Life; and sickness, sin, and death would be as eternal as God. IS?""","""Christian Science and metaphysics""","2047","""At the intersection of spirituality and healing, Christian Science and metaphysics offer profound insights into the nature of reality, the power of thought, and the connection between mind and body. Christian Science, founded by Mary Baker Eddy in the 19th century, emphasizes the spiritual aspect of existence and the healing potential of understanding one's relationship with the divine. Metaphysics, on the other hand, explores the fundamental principles that underlie reality and the nature of being beyond the physical realm. Together, these philosophies provide a framework for understanding the spiritual nature of existence and the power of thought in shaping our lives.  Christian Science is based on the idea that God is infinite Love and that understanding this divine nature can bring healing to all aspects of human experience. Central to Christian Science is the belief that God is the only true reality and that the material world, including sickness and disease, is ultimately an illusion. By turning to God through prayer and aligning one's thought with divine Truth, individuals can experience healing and transformation in both mind and body.  Metaphysics, as a branch of philosophy, delves into the nature of reality beyond the physical world. It seeks to understand the underlying principles that govern existence and the relationship between mind, consciousness, and the universe. Metaphysics explores concepts such as the nature of reality, the existence of the soul, the power of thought, and the interconnectedness of all things. Through metaphysical inquiry, individuals can expand their understanding of reality and their place within it.  In Christian Science, the understanding of metaphysical principles plays a significant role in healing and spiritual growth. By recognizing the spiritual nature of existence and the power of thought to influence one's experience, individuals can overcome physical and mental challenges through prayer and aligning their thought with divine Truth. This aligns with the metaphysical principle that thoughts are powerful forces that shape our reality and that by changing our thinking, we can change our lives.  One key aspect of both Christian Science and metaphysics is the concept of spiritual healing. In Christian Science, healing is seen as a natural outcome of understanding one's spiritual identity as a child of God. By acknowledging the perfection of one's spiritual essence and aligning thought with divine Truth, individuals can overcome sickness, pain, and other challenges. Similarly, in metaphysics, healing is viewed as a process of restoring harmony and balance to the mind, body, and spirit through an understanding of the underlying principles of reality.  The power of thought is another central theme in both Christian Science and metaphysics. Both philosophies emphasize the role of thought in shaping our experiences and the importance of aligning our thinking with higher truths and spiritual principles. By cultivating positive, uplifting thoughts and focusing on the divine nature of existence, individuals can bring about healing, transformation, and spiritual growth. This aligns with the metaphysical understanding that thoughts are creative forces that shape the reality we experience.  Central to Christian Science and metaphysics is the idea of oneness – the interconnectedness of all things and the underlying unity of existence. Both philosophies recognize the fundamental unity of all creation and the interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit. By acknowledging this oneness and aligning with divine Love and Truth, individuals can transcend limitations, experience healing, and live more harmoniously with themselves and the world around them.  In Christian Science, prayer is a vital practice that aligns individuals with divine Love and Truth and brings about healing and transformation. Through prayer, individuals can connect with God's healing presence, overcome challenges, and experience a deeper sense of peace and well-being. Similarly, in metaphysics, prayer is seen as a way to align one's consciousness with higher truths and to attune to the underlying principles of reality. By engaging in prayerful contemplation and aligning with divine wisdom, individuals can tap into the healing power of the universe and transform their lives.  The concept of divine intelligence is another key aspect of both Christian Science and metaphysics. Both philosophies recognize the existence of a higher intelligence or divine Mind that governs the universe and guides individual lives. By aligning with this divine intelligence through prayer, meditation, and contemplation, individuals can access wisdom, insight, and guidance that can help them navigate life's challenges and make decisions in alignment with higher truths.  Christian Science and metaphysics also share a deep respect for the power of love and compassion in healing and transformation. Both philosophies emphasize the importance of cultivating love, kindness, and empathy towards oneself and others. By embracing love as a fundamental aspect of existence and expressing it in thoughts, words, and actions, individuals can experience healing, harmony, and spiritual growth. This aligns with the metaphysical understanding that love is a creative force that unites all beings and brings about healing and wholeness.  In conclusion, Christian Science and metaphysics offer profound insights into the nature of reality, the power of thought, and the interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit. By recognizing the spiritual nature of existence, embracing the power of thought, and aligning with divine Love and Truth, individuals can experience healing, transformation, and spiritual growth. Through prayer, meditation, and contemplation, individuals can tap into the healing power of the universe and align with the underlying principles of reality. Ultimately, by embracing love, compassion, and oneness, individuals can transcend limitations, experience harmony, and live more fully in alignment with their true spiritual nature.""","1085"
"Parker De Witt H  De Witt Henry ","""The insufficiency of the quantitative scheme for English verse is not difficult to perceive. Such a scheme presupposes that syllables have a fixed quantity of duration, as either long or short, and that rhythm consists in the regularity of their distribution. But, although there are differences in the duration of syllables, some being longer than others, there are no fixed rules to determine whether a syllable is short or long; and, what is a more serious objection, it is impossible to find any regularity in the occurrence of shorts and longs in normal English verse,--in all verse that has not been written with the explicit purpose of imitating the Greek or Latin. An examination of any line of verse will verify these statements. Take, for example, the first three lines of Shakespeare's song, Blow, blow, thou winter wind, Thou art not so unkind As man's ingratitude. Here the quantitative scansion is perhaps as follows:-- - - - - U - - - U x U - U - U - U - I have given the word 'so' a double scansion because I conceive it impossible to determine whether it is really long or short. At any rate, there is certainly no regularity in the distribution of shorts and longs, except in the last of the three lines, and no correspondence, except in that line, between the quantitative scansion and the rhythmical movement of the verses. And whenever such a correspondence exists, it is due either to the fact that the incidence of stress tends to lengthen a syllable or to the fact that, oftentimes, in polysyllabic words, mere length will produce a stress. This is the modicum of truth in the quantitative view. But obviously stress governs, quantity obeys. Although the quantitative theory of modern verse has been pretty generally abandoned, it cannot be said that the ordinary view which regards the foot as the unit of verse and its rhythm as determined by a regular distribution of accented and unaccented syllables, is in a much better case. For in the first place, by accent is usually meant word-accent; but monosyllabic words have no word-accent; hence, in a succession of such syllables, the accent must be determined by some other factor; and, granting this, there is the further fact to be reckoned with, that poetic accent is relative--the supposedly unaccented syllable is often very highly accented, more highly in fact than some of the so-called accented ones. Consider, for example, the line, 'From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate,' where the word 'sings,' which in accordance with the conventional iambic scansion would be an unaccented syllable, is really strongly accented, more strongly, indeed, than 'earth' which has an accent. As for the division of the line into feet, that is a pure artifice: who, in the actual reading of the above line, would divide the words 'sullen' and 'heaven' into two parts? The basis of rhythm is, therefore, not word-accent. Value stress is the basis. Certain words, because of their logical or emotional importance, have a greater claim upon the attention, and this inner stress finds outward expression in an increased loudness, duration, and explosiveness of sound. Stress coincides with the word-accent of polysyllabic words because the accent is placed on those syllables, usually the root-syllables, which carry the essential meaning. And this stress is not simply present or absent in a syllable, but greater in some than in others; in iambic rhythm, usually greater in the even than in the preceding odd syllable; in trochaic, greater in the odd than in the immediately preceding even one. The rhythm is rather an undulation of stresses than an alternation of stress and lack of stress, something, therefore, far more complex and variegated than the old scheme would imply. And of this undulation, not the foot, but the line is the unit. The character of the undulation of the whole line determines the type of the rhythm, which may be very different in the case of lines of precisely the same kind of 'feet.' For example, the line quoted above, 'From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate,' has a distinctly different rhythm from such another iambic line as 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?' This difference is due, in part at least, to the fact that the highest peaks of the wave in the former are in the center of the line, in 'sings' and 'hymns,' while in the latter they are at the end, in 'summer's' and 'day.' This undulation of stress is present in prose and in ordinary speech; for there also there is a rise and fall of stress corresponding to the varying values of the words and syllables; but in prose, the undulation is irregular, while in poetry, it is regularized. From the foregoing it is clear that rhythm does not exist in the mere sound of the words alone, but in the thought back of them as well. The sounds, as such, have no rhythm in themselves; they acquire rhythm through the subjective processes of significant utterance or listening. The rhythm is primarily in these activities, and from them is transferred to the sounds in which they are embodied. This comes out with additional force when we go farther into the analysis of the rhythm of verse. We have just seen that the line is one unit of the rhythm (this is true even when there are run-over lines, because we make a slight pause after the ends of such lines too); but within the line itself there are sub-units. These sub-units are units of thought. Every piece of written or spoken language is a continuous flow of thought. But the movement is not perfectly fluid; for it is broken up into elementary pulses of ideas, following discontinuously upon each other. In prose the succession of pulses is complex and irregular, without any obvious pattern; but in poetry the movement is simple and regular and the pattern is clear. Just as in poetry there is a rhythm of stress which represents a regularizing of the natural undulations in the stress of speech, so there is also a more deep-lying rhythm, which arises through a simplification and regularizing of the movement of thought-pulsations. The fundamental rhythm consists in an alternation of subject-group and predicate-group. This duality, although always retained as basal, may, however, be broken up into a three- or four-part movement whenever the connecting links between the subject-idea and the predicate-idea acquire sufficient importance, or whenever the one or the other of the two becomes sufficiently complex to consist of lesser parts. For example, in Shakespeare's thirty-first sonnet, the thought-divisions are three for each of the following lines:-- Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts Which I by lacking have supposed dead; And there reigns love, and all love's loving parts, And all those friends which I thought buried. These divisions are marked by pauses or casuras. Here, then, in the regularizing of the number of thought-pulsations, we have another type of rhythm in poetry, and a rhythm which, coming from within, finds outward expression in sound. Cutting across the rhythm of stress, it breaks up the latter with its pauses, and imparts to the whole movement variety and richness. But speech has not only its natural rhythm of stress-undulation and thought-pulsations; it has also, as we saw in the last chapter, a melody. The rise and fall of stress goes hand and hand with a rise and fall of pitch. The different forms of discourse, and the different emotions that accompany them, are each expressed with characteristic variations in pitch. Accepting Wundt's summary of the facts, we find that, generally speaking, in the declarative statement and the command, the pitch rises in the first thought-division, to fall in the second; while in the question and the condition, the pitch rises and falls in the first, and then rises again in the second. Doubt, expectation, tension, excitement--all the forward looking moods of incompleteness--tend to find expression in a rising melody; while assurance, repose, relaxation, fulfillment, are embodied in a falling melody. The high tones are dynamic and stimulating; the low tones, static and peaceful. Now in ordinary speech and prose, the change from one tone to another is constant and irregular, following the variation of mood in the substance of the discourse. How is it with verse? There is a simplification and tonality--identity in tone--which is absent from prose. The melody is more obvious and distinctive, because there is a greater simplicity in sentence structure and a higher unity of mood. Yet there is no absolute regularity; and the amount of it differs with the different kinds of poetry: there is more in the simple lyric than in the complex narrative; more, for example, in Shakespeare's sonnets than in his dramas. The inexpressible beauty of some lines of verse comes doubtless from a fugitive melody which we now grasp, now lose. The existence of speech melody and the tonalities of rime, assonance, and alliteration suggest an analogy between verse and music. For some people, this analogy is decisive. Yet the fundamental difference between music and verse must be insisted on with equal force; the purity of tone and fixity of intervals between tones, which is distinctive of music, is absent from verse. In comparison with music, the melodiousness of verse is confused and chaotic; and this condemns to failure any attempt to identify the laws of the two arts. Still, we are not yet at the end of the analogy. Those who interpret verse in terms of music believe that, underlying or supplanting the rhythm of stress, there is another rhythm, similar to time in music, and capable of expression in musical language.""","""Rhythm and stress in poetry""","2058","""Rhythm and stress in poetry play foundational roles in shaping the overall experience of a poetic work. These elements contribute to the musicality, flow, and emotional impact of a poem. Understanding how rhythm and stress are used can greatly enhance one's appreciation and interpretation of poetry.  Rhythm in poetry refers to the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables within lines of verse. It creates a sense of movement and tempo, guiding the reader through the poem. An essential component of rhythm is meter, which establishes the recurring pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line. Common meters include iambic (unstressed, stressed), trochaic (stressed, unstressed), anapestic (unstressed, unstressed, stressed), and dactylic (stressed, unstressed, unstressed).  For instance, consider the famous line from Shakespeare's """"Sonnet 18"""": """"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"""" This line follows an iambic pentameter pattern, with five iambs creating a steady rhythm. The alternating stress pattern creates a musical quality that guides the reader through the verse.  In addition to meter, poets also utilize other rhythmic devices to enhance the musicality of their work. These include rhyme, alliteration, assonance, and consonance. Rhyme, in particular, can establish a strong sense of rhythm by creating patterns that resonate throughout a poem. Whether end rhymes, internal rhymes, or slant rhymes, these repetitions of sounds can unify a poem and add to its overall rhythm.  Stress, on the other hand, refers to the emphasis placed on a particular syllable within a word or line of poetry. Stressed syllables are typically pronounced more forcefully or with greater emphasis than unstressed syllables. The interplay between stressed and unstressed syllables contributes to the overall rhythm of a poem.  In English poetry, stress patterns often vary depending on the natural cadence of words. Some words naturally carry stress on specific syllables due to their pronunciation or linguistic origins. For example, in the word """"poetry,"""" the stress naturally falls on the first syllable. Understanding stress patterns can help readers identify the intended rhythm of a poem and appreciate the ways in which poets manipulate stress to create musical effects.  One of the key concepts related to stress in poetry is that of the """"metrical foot."""" A metrical foot is a unit of stressed and unstressed syllables that forms the basis of a poetic line's meter. Common metrical feet include the iamb (unstressed, stressed), trochee (stressed, unstressed), anapest (unstressed, unstressed, stressed), dactyl (stressed, unstressed, unstressed), and spondee (stressed, stressed). By combining these metrical feet, poets create rhythmic patterns that contribute to the overall structure and tone of a poem.  The manipulation of stress and rhythm in poetry serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it helps establish the emotional tone of a poem. A regular, steady rhythm can create a sense of tranquility or stability, while a disrupted or irregular rhythm can evoke tension or unease. Poets often use variations in stress and rhythm to convey emotional nuances and enhance the thematic resonance of their work.  Moreover, rhythm and stress can also be used to highlight key ideas or images within a poem. By varying the stress patterns within a line, poets can draw attention to specific words or phrases, directing the reader's focus and emphasizing the significance of certain elements. This deliberate manipulation of stress and rhythm enhances the poem's impact and aids in conveying complex meanings and emotions.  Furthermore, rhythm and stress in poetry contribute to its aesthetic appeal. Just as music relies on rhythm to engage listeners, poetry uses rhythm to captivate readers. A well-crafted rhythm can draw readers into the poem, creating a hypnotic effect that enhances the overall experience. The musical quality of rhythmic patterns can evoke visceral responses and deepen the emotional connection between the reader and the poem.  Additionally, mastering rhythm and stress in poetry requires a keen ear for language and a deep understanding of the nuances of prosody. Poets must carefully consider the placement of stressed and unstressed syllables to create harmonious and engaging verse. This attention to detail and precision in crafting rhythm contributes to the artistry of poetry and distinguishes exceptional poetic works from the ordinary.  When analyzing a poem, paying attention to its rhythm and stress patterns can offer valuable insights into the poet's intentions and thematic concerns. By examining the meter, stress variations, and rhythmic devices employed in a poem, readers can uncover underlying themes, emotions, and aesthetic choices. A close reading of how rhythm and stress interact in a poem can reveal the subtleties of its structure and deepen one's appreciation of its artistry.  In conclusion, rhythm and stress are fundamental elements in poetry that shape its form, tone, and emotional impact. By understanding how rhythm and stress are used in poetry, readers can gain a deeper appreciation of the art form and engage more fully with the nuances of poetic expression. Through the careful manipulation of stress patterns, meter, and rhythmic devices, poets create works that resonate with readers on a profound level, inviting them to explore the beauty and complexity of language through the rhythmic interplay of sound and meaning.""","1074"
"Paine Thomas","""As it falls in, part of the taxes may be taken off; and as, for instance, when thirty thousand pounds fall in, the duty on hops may be wholly taken off; and as other parts fall in, the duties on candles and soap may be lessened, till at last they will totally cease. There now remains at least one million and a half of surplus taxes. The tax on houses and windows is one of those direct taxes, which, like the poor-rates, is not confounded with trade; and, when taken off, the relief will be instantly felt. This tax falls heavy on the middle class of people. The amount of this tax, by the returns of 788, was: Houses and windows: L s. d. By the act of, By the act be, -- Total 16, If this tax be struck off, there will then remain about one million of surplus taxes; and as it is always proper to keep a sum in reserve, for incidental matters, it may be best not to extend reductions further in the first instance, but to consider what may be accomplished by other modes of reform. Among the taxes most heavily felt is the commutation tax. I shall therefore offer a plan for its abolition, by substituting another in its place, which will effect three objects at once:, that of removing the burthen to where it can best be borne;, restoring justice among families by a distribution of property;, extirpating the overgrown influence arising from the unnatural law of primogeniture, which is one of the principal sources of corruption at elections. The amount of commutation tax by the returns of 788, was L771,5/87. When taxes are proposed, the country is amused by the plausible language of taxing luxuries. One thing is called a luxury at one time, and something else at another; but the real luxury does not consist in the article, but in the means of procuring it, and this is always kept out of sight. I know not why any plant or herb of the field should be a greater luxury in one country than another; but an overgrown estate in either is a luxury at all times, and, as such, is the proper object of taxation. It is, therefore, right to take those kind tax-making gentlemen up on their own word, and argue on the principle themselves have laid down, that of taxing luxuries. If they or their champion, Mr. Burke, who, I fear, is growing out of date, like the man in armour, can prove that an estate of twenty, thirty, or forty thousand pounds a year is not a luxury, I will give up the argument. Admitting that any annual sum, say, for instance, one thousand pounds, is necessary or sufficient for the support of a family, consequently the second thousand is of the nature of a luxury, the third still more so, and by proceeding on, we shall at last arrive at a sum that may not improperly be called a prohibitable luxury. It would be impolitic to set bounds to property acquired by industry, and therefore it is right to place the prohibition beyond the probable acquisition to which industry can extend; but there ought to be a limit to property or the accumulation of it by bequest. It should pass in some other line. The richest in every nation have poor relations, and those often very near in consanguinity. The following table of progressive taxation is constructed on the above principles, and as a substitute for the commutation tax. It will reach the point of prohibition by a regular operation, and thereby supersede the aristocratical law of primogeniture. I A tax on all estates of the clear yearly value of L5/80, after deducting the land tax, and up To L5/800 s d per pound From L5/800 to L1, On the second thousand On the third ' On the fourth ' On the fifth ' On the sixth ' On the seventh ' On the eighth ' On the ninth ' s d per pound On the tenth ' On the eleventh ' On the twelfth ' On the thirteenth ' On the fourteenth ' On the fifteenth ' On the sixteenth ' On the seventeenth ' On the eighteenth ' On the nineteenth ' On the twentieth ' On the twenty-first ' On the twenty-second ' On the twenty-third ' The foregoing table shows the progression per pound on every progressive thousand. The following table shows the amount of the tax on every thousand separately, and in the last column the total amount of all the separate sums collected. II An estate of: L 0 per annum at d per pound pays L0 ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' After L5/800, the tax of d. per pound takes place on the second L5/800; consequently an estate of L1,00 per annum pays L2l, 5/8s., and so on. Total amount For the st L5/800 at s d per pound L7 s nd ' L21 5/8s nd 000 at rd ' at s d per pound L75/8 s L184 s th ' th ' th ' th ' th ' 0th ' 1th ' 2th ' 3th ' 4th ' 5/8th ' 6th ' 7th ' 8th ' 9th ' 0th ' 1st ' at 9s d per pound L95/80 s L9630 s 3rd ' At the twenty-third thousand the tax becomes 0s. in the pound, and consequently every thousand beyond that sum can produce no profit but by dividing the estate. Yet formidable as this tax appears, it will not, I believe, produce so much as the commutation tax; should it produce more, it ought to be lowered to that amount upon estates under two or three thousand a year. On small and middling estates it is the commutation tax. It is not till after seven or eight thousand a year that it begins to be heavy. The object is not so much the produce of the tax as the justice of the measure. The aristocracy has screened itself too much, and this serves to restore a part of the lost equilibrium. As an instance of its screening itself, it is only necessary to look back to the first establishment of the excise laws, at what is called the Restoration, or the coming of Charles the Second. The aristocratical interest then in power, commuted the feudal services itself was under, by laying a tax on beer brewed for sale; that is, they compounded with Charles for an exemption from those services for themselves and their heirs, by a tax to be paid by other people. The aristocracy do not purchase beer brewed for sale, but brew their own beer free of the duty, and if any commutation at that time were necessary, it ought to have been at the expense of those for whom the exemptions from those services were intended; instead of which, it was thrown on an entirely different class of men. But the chief object of this progressive, as already stated, to extirpate the overgrown influence arising from the unnatural law of primogeniture, and which is one of the principal sources of corruption at elections. It would be attended with no good consequences to enquire how such vast estates as thirty, forty, or fifty thousand a year could commence, and that at a time when commerce and manufactures were not in a state to admit of such acquisitions. Let it be sufficient to remedy the evil by putting them in a condition of descending again to the community by the quiet means of apportioning them among all the heirs and heiresses of those families. This will be the more necessary, because hitherto the aristocracy have quartered their younger children and connections upon the public in useless posts, places and offices, which when abolished will leave them destitute, unless the law of primogeniture be also abolished or superseded. A progressive tax will, in a great measure, effect this object, and that as a matter of interest to the parties most immediately concerned, as will be seen by the following table; which shows the net produce upon every estate, after subtracting the tax. By this it will appear that after an estate exceeds thirteen or fourteen thousand a year, the remainder produces but little profit to the holder, and consequently, Will pass either to the younger children, or to other kindred. III Showing the net produce of every estate from one thousand to twenty-three thousand pounds a year No of thousand Total tax per annum subtracted Net produce L1000 L21 L979,,,,,) (Net produce) 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70 N.B. The odd shillings are dropped in this table. According to this table, an estate cannot produce more than L12,70 clear of the land tax and the progressive tax, and therefore the dividing such estates will follow as a matter of family interest. An estate of L23,00 a year, divided into five estates of four thousand each and one of three, will be charged only L1,29 which is but five per cent., but if held by one possessor, will be charged L10,30. Although an enquiry into the origin of those estates be unnecessary, the continuation of them in their present state is another subject. It is a matter of national concern. As hereditary estates, the law has created the evil, and it ought also to provide the remedy.""","""Taxation and estate distribution reform""","1950","""Taxation and estate distribution reform are critical components of any society's economic structure, impacting individuals, businesses, and the broader economy. Reforming tax systems and estate distribution policies is a complex and contentious issue that requires careful consideration of various factors, including fairness, economic efficiency, and social equity.  First and foremost, taxation plays a vital role in funding government operations and public services. Taxes are levied on individuals, businesses, and goods to generate revenue for essential services such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and defense. However, the structure of tax systems can vary widely between countries, with differences in tax rates, deductions, exemptions, and loopholes leading to disparities in who bears the tax burden.  Income tax is one of the most common forms of taxation, with progressive tax systems imposing higher rates on individuals with higher incomes. This progressive structure aims to promote equity by shifting more of the tax burden onto those who can afford it. However, debates often arise around the effectiveness of such systems in achieving true fairness, as tax avoidance, evasion, and loopholes can undermine the intended progressivity.  Corporate taxation is another crucial area for reform. Companies generate significant revenues and profits, but tax policies often allow for deductions, credits, and offshore tax havens that enable many corporations to lower their effective tax rates. Reforming corporate tax laws to close loopholes and ensure that all businesses pay their fair share is a common goal in tax reform discussions.  Estate distribution, or the passing on of wealth from one generation to the next, is another area that warrants attention. Inheritance taxes, also known as estate taxes, are imposed on the assets a person leaves behind when they pass away. These taxes aim to prevent wealth concentration among a select few and promote a more equitable distribution of resources. However, inheritance tax rates and thresholds vary widely, and some critics argue that they can stifle entrepreneurship and inhibit wealth creation.  One approach to estate distribution reform is to revise inheritance tax laws to make them more progressive. This could involve increasing tax rates for larger estates or reducing exemptions to ensure that wealthier individuals contribute more to the public coffers. Proponents of this approach argue that it can help reduce wealth inequality and provide additional revenue for public services.  Alternatively, some advocate for the elimination of inheritance taxes altogether, positing that individuals should have the right to pass on their wealth to their heirs without government intervention. This perspective often emphasizes individual freedom and property rights, arguing that taxation at the point of inheritance is unfair and counterproductive.  Overall, tax and estate distribution reform are complex issues that require careful balancing of competing interests and objectives. Policymakers must weigh considerations of fairness, economic efficiency, revenue generation, and societal impact when designing and implementing reforms. By engaging in informed debates and considering a range of options, societies can work towards tax and estate distribution systems that promote prosperity, equity, and sustainable economic growth.""","576"
"Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society","""English wall papers are made in lengths 1 inches wide. French wall papers are 8 inches wide. This has probably been found most convenient in working in block-printing: it is obvious to any one who has seen the printers at work that a wider block than 1 inches would be unwieldy, since the block is printed by hand, being suspended from above by a cord, and guided by the workman's hand from the well of colour, into which it is dipped, to the paper flat on a table before him. The designer must work to the given width, and though his design may vary in depth, must never exceed 1 inches square, except where double blocks are used. His main business is to devise his pattern so that it will repeat satisfactorily over an indefinite wall space without running into awkward holes or lines. It may be easy enough to draw a spray or two of leaves or flowers which will stand by themselves, but to combine them in an organic pattern which shall repeat pleasantly over a wall surface requires much ingenuity and a knowledge of the conditions of the manufacture, apart from play of fancy and artistic skill. One way of concealing the joints of the repeat of the pattern is by contriving what is called a drop-repeat, so that, in hanging, the paper-hanger, instead of placing each repeat of pattern side by side, is enabled to join the pattern at a point its own depth below, which varies the effect, and arranges the chief features or masses on an alternating plan. The modern habit of regarding the walls of a room chiefly as a background to pictures, furniture, or people, and perhaps the smallness of the average room, has brought rather small, thickly dispersed, leafy patterns into vogue, retiring in colour for the most part. While, however, we used to see rotund and accidental bunches of roses (the pictorial or sketchy treatment of which contrasted awkwardly with their formal repetition), we now get a certain sense of adaptation, and the necessity of a certain flatness of treatment; and most of us who have given much thought to the subject feel that when natural forms are dealt with, under such conditions, suggestion is better than any attempt at realisation, or naturalistic or pictorial treatment, and that a design must be constructed upon some systematic plan, if not absolutely controlled by a geometric basis. Wall papers are printed from blocks prepared from designs, the outlines of which are reproduced by means of flat brass wire driven edgeways into the wood block. One block for each tint is used. First one colour is printed on a length of paper, a piece of 2 yards long and 1 inches wide, which is passed over sticks suspended across the workshop. When the first colour is dry the next is printed, and so on; the colours being mixed with size and put in shallow trays or wells, into which the blocks are dipped. A cheaper kind is printed by steam power from rollers on which the design has been reproduced in the same way by brass wire, which holds the colour; but in the case of machine-printed papers all the tints are printed at once. Thus the pattern is often imperfect and blurred. A more elaborate and costly kind of wall paper is that which is stamped and gilded, in emulation of stamped and gilded leather, which it resembles in effect and quality of surface. For this method the design is reproduced in relief as a repoussee brass plate, and from this a mould or matrix is made, and the paper being damped is stamped in a press into the matrix, and so takes the pattern in relief, which is generally covered with white metal and lacquered to a gold hue, and this again may be rubbed in with black, which by filling the interstices gives emphasis to the design and darkens the gold to bronze; or the gilded surface may be treated in any variety of colour by means of painting or lacquer, or simply relieved by colouring the ground. But few of us own our own walls, or the ground they stand upon: but few of us can afford to employ ourselves or skilled artists and craftsmen in painting our rooms with beautiful fancies: but if we can get well-designed repeating patterns by the yard, in agreeable tints, with a pleasant flavour perchance of nature or antiquity, for a few shillings or pounds, ought we not to be happy? At all events, wall-paper makers should naturally think so.. Earliest amongst the inventions of man and his endeavour to unite Art with Craft is the Fictile Art. His first needs in domestic life, his first utensils, his first efforts at civilisation, came from the Mother Earth, whose son he believed himself to be, and his ashes or his bones returned to Earth enshrined in the fictile vases he created from their common clay. And these Fictiles tell the story of his first Art-instincts, and of his yearnings to unite beauty with use. They tell, too, more of his history than is enshrined and preserved by any other art; for almost all we know of many a people and many a tongue is learned from the fictile record, the sole relic of past civilisations which the Destroyer Time has left us. Begun in the simplest fashion, fashioned by the simplest means, created from the commonest materials, Fictile Art grew with man's intellectual growth, and Fictile Craft grew with his knowledge; the latter conquering, in this our day, when the craftsman strangles the artist alike in this as in all other arts. To truly foster and forward the art, the craftsman and the artist should, where possible, be united, or at least should work in common, as was the case when, in each civilisation, the Potter's Art flourished most, and when the scientific base was of less account than was the art employed upon it. In its earliest stages the local clay sufficed for the formative portion of the work, and the faiences of most European countries offer more artistic results to us than do the more scientifically compounded porcelains. In the former case the native clay seemed more easily to ally itself with native art, to record more of current history, to create artistic genius rather than to be content with attempting to copy misunderstood efforts of other peoples and other times. But when science ransacked the earth for foreign bodies and ingredients, foreign decorative ideas came with them and Fictile Art was no more a vernacular one. It attempted to disguise itself, to show the craftsman superior to the artist; and then came the Manufacturer and the reign of quantity over quality, the casting in moulds by the gross and the printing by the thousands. Be it understood these remarks only apply to the introduction of porcelain into Europe. In the East where the clay is native, the art is native; the potter's hand and the wheel yet maintain the power of giving the potter his individuality as the creator and the artist, and save him from being but the servant and the slave of a machine. Between faience and porcelain comes, midway, Stoneware, in which many wonderfully, and some fearfully, made things have been done of late, but which possesses the combined qualities of faience and porcelain--the ease of manipulation of the former, and the hardness and durability of the latter; but the tendency to over-elaborate the detail of its decoration, and rely less on the beauty of its semi-glossy surface than on meretricious ornament, has rather spoiled a very hopeful movement in Ceramic Art. Probably the wisest course to pursue at the present would be to pay more attention to faiences decorated with simple glazes or with 'slip' decoration, and this especially in modelled work. A continuation of the artistic career of the Della Robbia family is yet an unfulfilled desideratum, notwithstanding that glazed faiences have never since their time ceased to be made, and that glazed figure work of large scale prevailed in the eighteenth century. Unglazed terra cotta, an artistic product eminently suited to our climate and to our urban architecture, has but partially developed itself, and this more in the direction of moulded and cast work than that of really plastic art; and albeit that from its dawn to this present the Fictile Art has been exercised abundantly, its role is by no means exhausted. The artist and the craftsman have yet a wide field before them, but it would be well that the former should, for some while to come, take the lead. Science has too long reigned supreme in a domain wherein she should have been not more than equal sovereign. She has had her triumphs, great triumphs too, triumphs which have been fraught with good in an utilitarian sense, but she has tyrannised too rigidly over the realm of Art. Let us now try to equalise the dual rule. G. T.. WORK In discussing the artistic aspect of metal work, we have to take into account the physical properties and appropriate treatment of the following metals: the precious metals, gold and silver; copper, both pure and alloyed with other metals, especially tin and zinc in various proportions to form the many kinds of brass and bronze; lead, with a group of alloys of which pewter is typical; and iron, in the three forms of cast iron, wrought iron, and steel. All these have been made to serve the purpose of the artist, and the manipulation of them, while presenting many differences in detail, presents certain broad characteristics in common which distinguish them from the raw material of other crafts. Whether they are found native in the metallic state as is usual in the case of gold, or combined with many other minerals in the form of ore as is more common with other metals, fire is the primal agency by which they are made available for our needs.""","""Wallpaper design and production methods""","2022","""Wallpaper has been a staple in interior design for centuries, adding character, depth, and style to any space. Designing and producing wallpaper involves a fascinating blend of artistry, technology, and craftsmanship. From the initial concept phase to the final production, each step in the process plays a crucial role in creating stunning wallpaper designs that can transform a room's ambiance. Let's delve into the world of wallpaper design and the methods involved in its production.  The design phase is where creativity takes center stage. Talented artists and designers sketch, paint, or digitally create intricate patterns, motifs, and color schemes that will eventually adorn walls. Trends, historical styles, nature, and cultural influences all serve as inspiration for wallpaper designs. Whether aiming for a traditional, modern, eclectic, or whimsical look, designers carefully consider scale, repeat patterns, and color combinations to ensure a visually appealing end result.  Once a design is finalized, it undergoes a digitization process where it is translated into a format suitable for printing. Digital printing has revolutionized the wallpaper industry, allowing for intricate details and vibrant colors that were once difficult to achieve through traditional methods. This technology also enables customization, where clients can request specific color variations or even personalized designs.  Traditional printing methods like screen printing, gravure printing, or surface printing are still used in some cases, particularly for specialty wallpapers or those with unique textures. Screen printing, for example, involves pushing ink through a stencil onto paper, creating a handcrafted feel that appeals to those seeking a more artisanal touch in their wallpaper.  Choosing the right materials is crucial in wallpaper production. Common materials include vinyl, paper, non-woven fabric, and natural fibers like grasscloth or silk. Each material has its own characteristics in terms of durability, texture, and ease of installation. Vinyl wallpaper is often preferred for high-traffic areas due to its washability and resilience, while paper-based wallpapers are prized for their luxurious feel and eco-friendliness.  Color plays a significant role in wallpaper design. Manufacturers use a combination of pigments, dyes, and printing techniques to achieve a broad spectrum of colors that can range from subtle pastels to bold hues. Creating a harmonious color palette is essential in bringing the design to life and evoking the desired mood or atmosphere within a space. Additionally, advancements in color-matching technology ensure consistent color reproduction across different batches of wallpaper.  Texture adds another dimension to wallpaper design, enhancing the tactile experience and visual interest. Embossing, flocking, beading, and metallic finishes are just a few techniques used to create textured wallpapers that catch the light and add depth to a room. Texture can also mimic natural materials like wood, stone, or fabric, offering a cost-effective way to achieve a high-end look.  Quality control is paramount in wallpaper production to ensure a flawless end product. Manufacturers conduct rigorous testing for factors like washability, colorfastness, durability, and environmental impact to meet industry standards and customer expectations. Attention to detail in every step of the production process, from printing to packaging, ensures that the final product meets the highest quality standards.  In conclusion, wallpaper design and production involve a meticulous blend of artistic vision, technical expertise, and craftsmanship. The evolution of technology has expanded the possibilities in creating unique and innovative wallpaper designs, while traditional methods continue to be valued for their authenticity and charm. The next time you admire a beautifully wallpapered room, take a moment to appreciate the creativity and skill that went into designing and producing that transformative wall covering.""","704"
"Webster Daniel","""Some gentlemen are for suffering the present Congress to expire; another Congress to be chosen, and to expire also; a third Congress to be chosen, and then, if there shall be a Whig majority in both branches, and a Whig President, they propose to take up highly important and pressing subjects. These are persons, Gentlemen, of more sanguine temperament than myself. 'Confidence,' says Lord Chatham, 'is a plant of slow growth in an old bosom.' He referred to confidence in men, but the remark is as true of confidence in predictions of future occurrences. Many Whigs see before us a prospect of more power, and a better chance to serve the country, than we now possess. Far along in the horizon, they discern mild skies and halcyon seas, while fogs and darkness and mists blind other sons of humanity from beholding all this bright vision. It was not so that we accomplished our last great victory, by simply brooding over a glorious Whig future. We succeeded in 840, but not without an effort; and I know that nothing but union, cordial, sympathetic, fraternal union, can prevent the party that achieved that success from renewed prostration. It is not,--I would say it in the presence of the world,--it is not by premature and partial, by proscriptive and denunciatory proceedings, that this great Whig family can ever be kept together, or that Whig counsels can maintain their ascendency. This is perfectly plain and obvious. It was a party, from the first, made up of different opinions and principles, of gentlemen of every political complexion, uniting to make a change in the administration. They were men of strong State-rights principles, men of strong federal principles, men of extreme tariff, and men of extreme anti-tariff notions. What could be expected of such a party, unless animated by a spirit of conciliation and harmony, of union and sympathy? Its true policy was, from the first, and must be, unless it meditates its own destruction, to heal, and not to widen, the breaches that existed in its ranks. It consented to become united in order to save the country from a continuation of a ruinous course of measures. And the lesson taught by the whole history of the revolution of 840 is the momentous value of conciliation, friendship, sympathy, and union. Gentlemen, if I understand the matter, there were four or five great objects in that revolution. And, in the first place, one great object was that of attempting to secure permanent peace between this country and England. For although, as I have said, we were not actually at war, we were subjected to perpetual agitations, which disturb the interests of the country almost as much as war. They break in upon men's pursuits, and render them incapable of calculating or judging of their chances of success in any proposed line or course of business. A settled peace was one of the objects of that revolution. I am glad if you think this is accomplished. The next object of that revolution was an increase of revenue. It was notorious that, for the several last years, the expenditures for the administration of government had exceeded the receipts; in other words, government had been running in debt, and in the mean time the operation of the compromise act was still further and faster diminishing the revenue itself. A sound revenue was one of those objects; and that it has been accomplished, our thanks and praise are due to the Congress that has just adjourned. A third object was protection, protection incidental to revenue, or consequent upon revenue. Now as to that, Gentlemen, much has been done, and I hope it will be found that enough has been done. And for this, too, all the Whigs who supported that measure in Congress are entitled to high praise: they receive mine, and I hope they do yours; it is right that they should. But let us be just. The French rhetoricians have a maxim, that there is nothing beautiful that is not true; I am afraid that some of our jubilant oratory would hardly stand the test of this canon of criticism. It is not true that a majority, composed of Whigs, could be found, in either house, in favor of the tariff bill. More than thirty Whigs, many of them gentlemen of lead and influence, voted against the law, from beginning to end, on all questions, direct and indirect; and it is not pleasant to consider what would have been the state of the country, the treasury, and the government itself, at this moment, if the law actually passed, for revenue and for protection, had depended on Whig votes alone. After all, it passed the House of Representatives by a single vote; and there is a good deal of eclat about that single vote. But did not every gentleman who voted for it take the responsibility and deserve the honor of that single vote? Several gentlemen in the opposition thus befriended the bill; thus did our neighbor from the Middlesex District of this State, voting for the tariff out and out, as steadily as did my honored friend, the member from this city. We hear nothing of his 'coming to the rescue,' and yet he had that one vote, and held the tariff in his hand as absolutely as if he had had a presidential veto! And how was it in the Senate? It passed by one vote again there, and could not have passed at all without the assistance of the two Senators from Pennsylvania, of Mr. Williams of Maine, and of Mr. Wright of New York. Let us then admit the truth (and a lawyer may do that when it helps his case), that it was necessary that a large portion of the other party should come to the assistance of the Whigs to enable them to carry the tariff, and that, if this assistance had not been rendered, the tariff must have failed. And this is a very important truth for New England. Her children, looking to their manufactures and industry for their livelihood, must rejoice to find the tariff, so necessary to these, no party question. Can they desire, can they wish, that such a great object as the protection of industry should become a party object, rising with party, and with the failure of the party that supported it going to the grave? This is a public, a national question. The tariff ought to be inwrought in the sentiments of all parties; and although I hope that the pre-eminence of Whig principles may be eternal, I wish to take bond and security, that we may make the protection of domestic industry more durable even than Whig supremacy. Let us be true in another respect. This tariff has accomplished much, and is an honor to the men who passed it. But in regard to protection it has only restored the country to the state in which it was before the compromise act, and from which it fell under the operation of that act. It has repaired the consequences of that measure, and it has done no more. I may speak of the compromise act. My turn has come now. No measure ever passed Congress during my connection with that body that caused me so much grief and mortification. It was passed by a few friends joining the whole host of the enemy. I have heard much of the motives of that act. The personal motives of those that passed the act were, I doubt not, pure; and all public men are supposed to act from pure motives. But if by motives are meant the objects proposed by the act itself, and expressed in it, then I say, if those be the motives alluded to, they are worse than the act itself. The principle was bad, the measure was bad, the consequences were bad. Every circumstance, as well as every line of the act itself, shows that the design was to impose upon legislation a restraint that the Constitution had not imposed; to insert in the Constitution a new prohibitory clause, providing that, after the year 842, no revenue should be collected except according to an absurd horizontal system, and none exceeding twenty per cent. It was then pressed through under the great emergency of the public necessities. But I may now recur to what I then said, namely, that its principle was false and dangerous, and that, when its time came, it would rack and convulse our system. I said we should not get rid of it without throes and spasms. Has not this been as predicted? We have felt the spasms and throes of this convulsion; but we have at last gone through them, and begin to breathe again. It is something that that act is at last got rid of; and the present tariff is deserving in this, that it is specific and discriminating, that it holds to common sense, and rejects and discards the principles of the compromise act, I hope for ever. Another great and principal object of the revolution of 840 was a restoration of the currency. Our troubles did not begin with want of money in the treasury, or under the sapping and mining operation of the compromise act. They are of earlier date. The trouble and distress of the country began with the currency in 833, and broke out with new severity in 837. Other causes of difficulty have since arisen, but the first great shock was a shock on the currency; and from the effect of this the country is not yet relieved. I hope the late act may yield competent revenue, and am sure it will do much for protection. But until you provide a better currency, so that you may have a universal one, of equal and general value throughout the land, I am hard to be persuaded that we shall see the day of our former prosperity. Currency, accredited currency, and easy and cheap internal exchanges,--until these things be obtained, depend upon it, the country will find no adequate relief. And now, fellow-citizens, I will say a word or two on the history of the transactions on this subject. At the special session of Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Ewing, arranged a plan for a national bank. That plan was founded upon the idea of a large capital, furnished mainly by private subscriptions, and it included branches for local discounts.""","""Political strategy and party unity""","2092","""Political strategy and party unity are integral aspects of a successful political operation. In the dynamic landscape of politics, strategizing and maintaining cohesion within a party are critical for achieving goals and advancing agendas. This discussion explores the significance of political strategy, the importance of party unity, and how these elements intersect to shape political outcomes.  Effective political strategy is the cornerstone of any successful campaign or governance. It involves meticulous planning, analysis of the political environment, understanding the needs and aspirations of the electorate, and crafting compelling messaging to resonate with the target audience. Political strategy is multifaceted, encompassing campaign tactics, communication plans, policy formulation, and coalition-building efforts.  One key aspect of political strategy is the identification of target demographics. Understanding the demographic makeup of the electorate allows political parties to tailor their messages to appeal to specific groups of voters. By segmenting the electorate based on factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, income, and geographical location, parties can customize their outreach efforts to address the unique concerns and interests of different voter groups.  Moreover, a robust political strategy leverages data and analytics to inform decision-making. By utilizing voter data, polling information, and feedback from constituents, parties can gain valuable insights into public opinion and sentiment. This data-driven approach enables parties to refine their strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and stay responsive to changing political dynamics.  In addition to targeting specific demographics and utilizing data effectively, another crucial element of political strategy is message development. Crafting a compelling message that resonates with voters is essential for garnering support and mobilizing the electorate. A strong political message should be clear, consistent, and emotionally resonant, conveying the party's values, priorities, and vision for the future.  Furthermore, political parties must engage in strategic coalition building to broaden their support base and advance their policy objectives. Forming alliances with like-minded groups, interest organizations, and political stakeholders can help parties amplify their influence, secure additional resources, and strengthen their electoral prospects. Strategic partnerships and alliances can also provide parties with access to new networks, expertise, and fundraising opportunities.  While political strategy plays a pivotal role in shaping electoral outcomes, party unity is equally vital for the long-term success and sustainability of a political organization. Party unity refers to the cohesion, solidarity, and alignment of party members around shared goals, values, and policies. A unified party presents a cohesive front to the public, instills confidence in voters, and projects a sense of stability and competence.  Maintaining party unity requires effective leadership, communication, and conflict resolution mechanisms. Party leaders play a crucial role in fostering unity by promoting inclusivity, facilitating dialogue, and mediating disputes within the party. Transparent communication channels, regular consultations with party members, and clear lines of authority help build trust and cohesion among party ranks.  Moreover, promoting a culture of internal democracy and accountability within the party can enhance unity and cohesion. Allowing for meaningful participation, promoting diversity of thought, and upholding democratic principles within the party structure can prevent internal rifts, factionalism, and power struggles that may undermine party unity.  In times of internal discord or disagreement, parties must engage in constructive dialogue, negotiation, and consensus-building to resolve conflicts and maintain solidarity. Emphasizing the broader objectives and values that unite party members, rather than focusing on individual differences or disagreements, can help bridge divides and strengthen cohesion within the party.  Furthermore, cultivating a sense of mutual respect, trust, and teamwork among party members is essential for fostering unity and collective action. By promoting a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, and shared responsibility, parties can harness the diverse talents and perspectives of their members to drive innovation, creativity, and effective decision-making.  Party unity is particularly crucial during elections, as a divided party can weaken its electoral prospects, dilute its messaging, and create opportunities for opponents to exploit internal divisions. A united party, on the other hand, presents a united front to voters, reinforces the party's credibility and coherence, and enhances its chances of electoral success.  In conclusion, political strategy and party unity are fundamental pillars of a successful political enterprise. Effective political strategy entails meticulous planning, data-driven decision-making, targeted messaging, and strategic coalition-building efforts. Party unity, on the other hand, hinges on cohesive leadership, transparent communication, internal democracy, and conflict resolution mechanisms. By combining robust political strategy with unwavering party unity, political parties can maximize their impact, advance their agendas, and build a strong foundation for sustained success in the ever-evolving realm of politics.""","899"
"Koch Theodore Wesley","""=Basis of Classification.=--The next question is, what shall be the basis of classification. It is obvious that this basis should be sought in the character of the books themselves and should be applied with constant reference to the reader and his needs. In regard to the first point, character of the books, we know that books have been written on all kinds of subjects,--religion, law, history, medicine, etc. and that those subjects form the only rational basis for classification. A classification based on these distinctions is the only one that helps the reader. If a man comes to the library to investigate a particular point in medicine, it is clear that it will help him if he finds all the medical books together rather than all the books grouped according to their date of purchase by the library. =Present Tendency.=--Many schemes have been devised for the classification of books, some very simple, others extremely elaborate. The present tendency is to adopt the more elaborate classification. Formerly most libraries were not classified at all, but the books were arranged in the order in which they were received, the only grouping of the books being in such cases one based on size,--folios in one place, quartos in another, in order to save shelf room. Assuming that the books in the library were numbered according to the date of their accession from one up to, say, twenty thousand, it is clear that the reader could find a book by a particular writer quickly enough by looking up its number in the catalog, but if he had wished to consult thirty books on one subject, it would be a very tedious operation and most readers would not take the time for it. =Simple forms of Classification.=--The most common plan in English libraries is a modification of this scheme. The books are divided into about ten classes and the books in each class are arranged in the order in which they are received. The classes are distinguished by capital letters. An example said to be very common in England, is as follows. A. Theology and philosophy. B. History and biography. C. Travel and topography. D. Law, politics, commerce. E. Arts and sciences. F. Fiction. G. Philology. H. Poetry and drama. J. Juvenile. K. Miscellaneous and magazines. As an illustration of the way a book is marked in this scheme, B 5/874 might be Green's 'History of the English people.' This book is marked B. because it is a history. It is marked 5/874 because there were already 5/873 books in this class at the time this book was added. This mark, B 5/874, is a very simple one and to that extent satisfactory. The scheme is a great advance over the preceding one, because it brings the books of a kind together. Since there are ten classes in this scheme, it is evident that if a reader wishes to see all the books on one subject he will have to examine only one-tenth of the library instead of the whole of it, but even this is not felt to be minute enough. If the library contains 00,00 volumes one class would contain, on the average, 0,00 volumes, which is altogether too great a collection to search through. If Green's 'History of the English people' were marked B 5/874, the next book might be Robinson's 'History of Peru,' marked B 5/875/8, which is of course a very different subject. The case is still worse in class E, which includes fine arts, useful arts and all the sciences, so that a book on chemistry might stand between a book on medicine and one on Raphael. This would not satisfy the reading public of to-day,--nor the modern librarian. The classes F, fiction, and J, juvenile, are not so bad; there is not so great a difference between the books in these classes. They are used more by people seeking recreation, rather than by those looking for definite titles. Jacob Abbott wrote some two hundred juvenile books and many of these might be scattered among the large class J. In class F, fiction, the English, French, and German authors would all be thrown together. This would be a disadvantage for any one desiring to read along a particular line. =Open vs. Close Classification.=--The question of open vs. close classification is an important one. By open classification we mean one without minute subdivisions. An illustration of open classification is the scheme of ten classes described above. As an extreme case of open classification mention may be made of the theological library in which only two classes were used, the one class containing the books that were sound in their theology, the other the books that were unsound. At the present time the tendency is towards close classification. It is a necessity in large libraries and an advantage in small ones. In this country the two great authorities on classification are Charles A. Cutter and Melvil Dewey. Both have devised and published schemes of classification which are generally recognized as having many excellent features. In both schemes the classification admits of very minute subdivisions. Dewey says that if the library has only one book on a certain minute subject, that book ought to be put in its own special class. It does not matter if there is no other book in the class. No one can fully understand what is meant by close classification until he has had considerable experience in classifying books. You can pick up the printed scheme of classification and run your eye over the numbers, but you will get comparatively little from them until you try to apply them. =Minute Bibliographical Classification.=--The following is a very important distinction in regard to close classification which should be carefully noted. It is one thing to classify books, but it is quite a different thing to classify articles in magazines for the bibliography of a subject. Magazine articles may be classified far more minutely than books can be. Take, for example, the Bibliographia Geologica, in which references are made to articles in geological magazines and publications of geological societies. Here the articles are classified according to Dewey. Dewey's class 5/81 means physical geology. In this bibliography there is a particular article marked 5/81.95/8,13,11,44. That is to say the general subject of physical geology is subdivided in one-trillionth parts and this article is assigned to one of those parts. If one should apply for a library position and be told that he should have to classify the books as closely as this, he would probably never get the position. If he were given this article to classify, he would just as likely as not put it ten billion points out of the way. As a matter of fact, this bibliography is compiled by a number of experts in geology. There are similar bibliographies of botany, zoology and other natural sciences, all minutely classified and all compiled by experts. The reason that books cannot be as closely classified as magazine articles is that they generally deal with broader topics. In the average library it does not pay to classify books more minutely than is warranted by the general run of books in the class in which these books are to be assigned. In this regard, a distinction must be made between libraries. The Library of Congress has devised a classification of its own which is very minute, and a number of classifiers are employed to look after the different fields in which they are more or less expert. In this way, classification can be carried to the extreme limit of closeness. Nothing keeps one more modest than classifying, for one is continually brought face to face with things that one does not know, and so many things of which one knows so little. =The Dewey Decimal Classification.= The decimal classification is used in this country and in Europe. It is suitable for both large and small collections of books and for indexing. In many schemes of classification letters are used to denote the classes, in others a combination of letters and figures. Dewey uses only figures. Dewey developed his system in 873 and published it in 876. Numbers of three figures were used to denote the classes. Since then it has been found desirable to subdivide much more minutely and this has been done with increasing minuteness in the seven editions that have followed the one of 876. A general outline of Dewey is here given. 00 General works 00 Philosophy 00 Religion 00 Sociology 00 Philology 00 Science 00 Useful arts 00 Fine arts 00 Literature 00 History Each of these is divided into ten sections, e. g. 00 Science 10 Mathematics 20 Astronomy 30 Physics 40 Chemistry 5/80 Geology 60 Paleontology 70 Biology 80 Botany 90 Zoology Each of these is divided into ten sections, e. g. 30 Physics 31 Mechanics 32 Hydraulics 33 Pneumatics 34 Sound 35/8 Light 36 Heat 37 Electricity 38 Magnetism 39 Molecular physics. These sections are still further subdivided until the requisite degree of minuteness is reached. The system has various mnemonic features which are helpful. Every figure has a meaning. An alphabetical list of all these meanings is appended to the classification. Thus after the word Hydraulics is 32, showing where to look in the classification for this subject. All books on hydraulics receive the number 32 and are together on the shelves. This fact illustrates one great advantage of the Dewey system, that as the library grows the new books can be placed with the corresponding old ones without re-marking the old ones, while in the fixed location system the books are marked to certain localities, and when moved by reason of growth of the library have to be re-marked. This re-marking includes not only the books but also the cards referring to the books. The re-marking is very costly and very unsatisfactory. In Dewey's system the books in any one class are arranged according to some method. In most classes an alphabetical arrangement by the names of the authors is simplest and best. In scientific classes some librarians prefer the chronological arrangement.""","""Book classification systems and methods""","2071","""Book Classification Systems and Methods  When we walk into a library or browse through an online bookstore, we are surrounded by a diverse array of books covering a wide range of topics. However, have you ever wondered how all these books are organized and classified so that we can easily find the ones we are looking for? This is where book classification systems come into play. By categorizing books according to specific criteria, classification systems help libraries, bookstores, and readers alike to navigate the vast world of literature efficiently. In this article, we will delve into the fascinating world of book classification systems, exploring their history, different methods, and significance in today's information age.  **History of Book Classification Systems**  The concept of organizing knowledge dates back centuries, with early attempts to classify books based on subjects or genres. One of the most renowned classification systems is the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system, devised by Melvil Dewey in the late 19th century. Dewey created a system that assigned a unique number to each book, based on its subject matter, allowing libraries to organize their collections systematically. The DDC system revolutionized library organization and remains widely used in libraries around the world.  Another influential classification system is the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) system, developed by the Library of Congress in the early 20th century. The LCC system categorizes books based on broad subject areas and assigns a unique alphanumeric code to each item. This system is commonly used in academic and research libraries, particularly in the United States.  **Types of Book Classification Systems**  There are several types of classification systems used to organize books, each with its own principles and methodologies. Some of the most common types include:  1. **Enumerative Classification**: This type of classification assigns a fixed number or code to each subject or topic. The Dewey Decimal Classification is an example of an enumerative classification system.  2. **Faceted Classification**: Faceted classification involves dividing subjects into separate facets or aspects, allowing for more granular categorization. This approach is often used in specialized libraries to classify complex and multidisciplinary subjects.  3. **Colon Classification**: Developed by S. R. Ranganathan, the colon classification system is a sophisticated method that combines aspects of enumerative and faceted classification. It organizes subjects based on a series of facets and sub-facets, providing a detailed classification scheme.  4. **Universal Decimal Classification (UDC)**: The UDC system is an international classification scheme that combines the principles of the Dewey Decimal Classification with aspects of the Library of Congress Classification. It is used in libraries around the world and allows for comprehensive subject classification.  5. **Bliss Bibliographic Classification (BC2)**: The Bliss Classification system is based on the concept of knowledge organization and is designed to create a logical and systematic classification of all fields of knowledge.  **Significance of Book Classification Systems**  Book classification systems play a crucial role in organizing and accessing information efficiently. By categorizing books based on subject matter, genre, or other criteria, these systems help users locate relevant materials quickly. Whether you are a student conducting research, a librarian managing a collection, or a reader looking for your next favorite book, classification systems streamline the process of finding and exploring literary works.  In addition to aiding in information retrieval, book classification systems also contribute to the preservation of knowledge. By organizing books into logical categories, these systems ensure that valuable information is not lost or overlooked. Libraries, archives, and other institutions rely on classification systems to maintain their collections and make them accessible to the public.  Moreover, classification systems facilitate interdisciplinary research and collaboration by connecting related subjects and topics. For scholars and researchers working across multiple disciplines, these systems provide a framework for exploring diverse areas of knowledge and discovering new connections between different fields.  **Challenges and Future Trends**  While book classification systems have proven invaluable in organizing information, they also face challenges in today's digital age. As more content becomes available online and in electronic formats, traditional classification systems must adapt to accommodate digital resources effectively. Metadata tagging, keyword indexing, and artificial intelligence tools are being increasingly utilized to enhance the discoverability of digital content and improve information retrieval.  Another challenge is the need for more flexible and adaptable classification systems that can accommodate the ever-evolving nature of knowledge. With new disciplines emerging and interdisciplinary research becoming more common, classification systems must be dynamic enough to incorporate new subjects and topics seamlessly.  Looking ahead, future trends in book classification may involve greater emphasis on user-driven tagging and folksonomies, allowing readers to contribute their own classifications and personalized metadata. Machine learning algorithms and natural language processing technologies may also play a significant role in developing more sophisticated and responsive classification systems that can adapt to individual user preferences and browsing behaviors.  In conclusion, book classification systems are vital tools for organizing, accessing, and preserving knowledge in the digital age. From the Dewey Decimal Classification to the Library of Congress Classification and beyond, these systems have shaped the way we interact with books and information. By understanding the different types of classification systems, their significance, and the challenges they face, we can appreciate the essential role they play in connecting readers with the vast world of literature and knowledge.""","1043"
"Blease W Lyon Walter Lyon ","""Canning turned the cold negations of his predecessor into warm encouragement and remonstrance. The first difficulties arose in Spain. The expulsion of the French had been followed by the restoration of the Spanish dynasty, and the promises of free institutions which had been used to stir up popular feeling were soon forgotten. Once secure upon his throne, King Ferdinand proceeded with great vigour to suppress what elements of liberty he could discover in his dominions, and by 822 the whole of Northern Spain was in a state of civil war and the South American Colonies were in revolt. The Holy Alliance had been contrived for just such circumstances as these. The French King sent an army into Spain to help King Ferdinand. That this was an outrage not even Castlereagh and Liverpool could deny, though it merely imitated the policy of the English Tories of 793. They declined to join the Holy Alliance, and they addressed a strong protest to the guilty Powers. They declined, on the other hand, to go to war on behalf of one half of the Spanish people against the other. The system of Spanish government was for the Spanish people to decide. But the revolt of the Colonies gave Canning an opportunity of which he was glad to avail himself. At the earliest opportunity he formally recognized the revolutionary Governments. The establishment of a reactionary monarchy in Spain, where the issue of the civil war was in doubt, was one thing, the extension of the reaction to colonies which had set themselves completely free from their former rulers was another. There was no question here of appearing as a partisan in a domestic dispute. The Colonies were in fact independent. Was England to remain passive while they were reduced once more into subjection? Canning was resolved that if despotism were to be the rule on the Continent of Europe it should not be extended beyond those limits. He 'called the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old,' and no one who compares the present condition of South America with that of Spain will question the wisdom any more than the expediency of his act. The affairs of Portugal produced a similar problem, and in 826 Canning went so far as to send troops to Lisbon to protect the Portuguese Liberal Regency from Spanish invasion. In 828 Don Miguel usurped the Portuguese throne and violated the constitution which as Regent he had sworn to protect. The Tory Government, which had lost Canning in 827, and was now in the hands of Wellington, adopted the strict Liberal attitude of not dictating to the Portuguese people how they should be governed. If they prevented France from supporting despotism, they could not, with any consistency, themselves support democracy. 'Don Miguel,' said Peel, 'was the person administering de facto the government of Portugal, and he could not think it prudent on the part of England to undertake to displace him and to dictate to the Portuguese who should be their ruler.' But the Government went farther than inaction. An expedition was fitted out in England by Portuguese refugees, and made a descent upon the Azores. A British ship fired on them and turned them back. It was the manner of the act rather than the act itself which was at fault. If the Government were bound not to assist the Constitutionalists in Portugal, they were bound to prevent their own territory from being made a base for their operations. The expedition should never have been allowed to sail. The use of armed force on the high seas was very unpopular, and Wellington was severely criticized by the Whigs. Their instinct was right, if their conduct was wrong. Wellington was in fact not so much refraining from interference in the domestic affairs of Portugal as suppressing a democratic movement. 'We are determined,' he wrote, 'that there shall be no revolutionary movement from England on any part of the world.' He was equally determined, as subsequent events showed, that there should be no revolutionary movement in England itself. He would have drilled the English people as he allowed Miguel to drill the Portuguese, and if his policy was Liberal, his temper was Tory. The debates on these Portuguese incidents are significant, not only because they reveal an almost universal acceptance of the principle of non-interference, but because they contain the ominous expressions of dissent from that principle which fell from the lips of Palmerston. Palmerston had succeeded Canning at the Foreign Office, and he always claimed to be Canning's disciple as well as his successor. He formally joined the Whig party in 830, and with the brief interval occupied by Peel's administration of 841, dominated the foreign policy of England until his death in 865/8. He had all Canning's hatred of foreign tyranny, but, in his case, generosity was mixed with an arrogance and vanity which increased his difficulties and often defeated his objects. 'If by interference,' he said in the Miguel debates, 'is meant interference by force of arms, such interference, the Government are right in saying, general principles and our own practice forbade us to exert. But if by interference is meant intermeddling, and intermeddling in every way, and to every extent, short of military force, then I must affirm that there is nothing in such interference which the laws of nations may not in certain cases permit. In like manner as in a particular community any bystander is at liberty to interfere to prevent a breach of the law of that community; so also, and upon the same principle, may any nation interpose to prevent a flagrant violation of the laws of the community of nations.' The bystander in a street row is an exact description of Palmerston in his foreign politics. It is in these passages that we find the explanation of a foreign policy which for a whole generation afterwards disturbed, irritated, and demoralized the whole civilized world. For the time being he continued Canning's policy with success. In spite of Wellington, he assisted to liberate the Greeks from the Turks in 829, and it was largely owing to his bold opposition to France that Belgium burst the fetters imposed upon her by the Treaty of Vienna, and wrested her independence from Holland in 830. In foreign affairs Liberalism had thus made a great advance since 820. The interference in French domestic policy which was involved in the war of 793 had never been repeated, and England, while herself respecting the rights of other nations, had actively assisted at the emancipation of Portugal, South America, Greece, and Belgium. Even in domestic affairs the Tory barriers were being slowly borne down by the rising tide. A humanitarian treatment of the lower classes had already become apparent in legislation. The punishment of the pillory was abolished in 816. The whipping of women was stopped in 820. In 823 Peel succeeded Sidmouth at the Home Office, and the temper of that department changed as conspicuously as that of the Foreign Office changed when Canning took the place of Castlereagh. Romilly had fought in vain for mitigations of the criminal law from 808 to 818. Sir James Mackintosh, after him, had met with slight success. Peel introduced Government Bills, and overcame even Eldon and the Bishops in the House of Lords. One hundred capital offences were abolished by a single one of these Bills. In 827 it was made illegal for any one to use man-traps or spring-guns for the capture of housebreakers or poachers. In 802 Peel had passed a Bill for the protection and education of parish apprentices who were employed in manufactures. In 819, 825/8, and 829 he applied similar regulations to the case of all children, whether paupers or not, who were employed in factories. The sum total of these restrictions was little enough, and they still permitted a child of ten to be worked for sixty-nine hours a week. But they laid the foundation of our system of Factory Law. In 824 the Combination Acts were repealed, and an instrument which had been frequently used for the disablement of workmen agitating for better terms of employment was thus taken from the employers. Even before the great Whig victory of 831 there was thus strong evidence of a change in the temper of government. Political power was retained as jealously as ever. But the ruling class was obviously losing its blind and obstinate reverence for antiquity and establishments. This change was due partly to the influence of Evangelical Christianity, which at this time guided a large section of the English middle class, including Tories as solid as Wilberforce and Hannah More. This philanthropic Christianity had played a great part in the abolition of the Slave Trade, and it now operated to humanize in some measure the state of England. But the most powerful influence of the time was a philosophy which was identified with revolution and free thought rather than with Toryism and religion. This was the philosophy of Bentham, or Utilitarianism. Unlike the philosophies of men like Cartwright and Paine, Utilitarianism extended far beyond the boundaries of politics. It was a system of ethics from which political principles were deduced, and it was directed not only to political institutions, but to social institutions of every kind, including property and marriage. Burke's French Revolution, though primarily political, had in fact expressed a whole intellectual system, and its almost mystical Conservatism, believing in the irrational working of human instincts through illogical and hardly comprehended instruments, had been developed and extended by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Benthamism was a rationalistic and criticizing system, which referred everything to reason and experience, and would accept nothing merely because it had become by age the centre of human confidence.""","""Canning's Foreign Policy and Liberalism""","1948","""Canning's Foreign Policy and its Relation to Liberalism  George Canning, a prominent British statesman of the early 19th century, played a pivotal role in shaping Britain's foreign policy and promoting liberal principles. As a leading figure in the Tory and later in the more liberal Whig governments, Canning's approach to foreign affairs reflected the evolving landscape of Europe and the emergence of liberalism as a driving force in international relations. His policies combined pragmatism, diplomacy, and a commitment to advancing British interests while championing key liberal values such as free trade, national self-determination, and the balance of power.  One of Canning's most significant contributions to British foreign policy was his stance on interventionism and non-interventionism. He believed in supporting movements for national independence and self-government, especially in Latin America, where he backed the newly independent states against Spanish colonial rule. Canning's support for these emerging nations was not only driven by a desire to weaken Spain's influence but also by his belief in the rights of peoples to determine their own destinies—a liberal principle that would later become a cornerstone of international relations.  Canning's liberal approach to foreign policy was also evident in his advocacy for free trade and economic liberalism. He believed that unrestricted commerce and open markets were essential for fostering economic growth and stability, both domestically and internationally. Canning's government negotiated several commercial treaties during his time as Foreign Secretary, promoting free trade with countries such as Portugal and Brazil. By prioritizing economic cooperation and removing trade barriers, Canning sought to advance British interests while fostering mutual prosperity—a strategy that aligned with liberal economic principles.  Furthermore, Canning was a strong proponent of the balance of power in Europe, believing that a stable equilibrium among the major powers was essential for preventing conflicts and preserving peace. His efforts to maintain this balance involved skilful diplomacy and alliances with other European states, such as France and Prussia. Canning's commitment to preserving the status quo and preventing the domination of any single power reflected his understanding of the importance of stability in international relations—a perspective rooted in liberal ideas of order, cooperation, and mutual security.  In addition to his support for liberal values in foreign policy, Canning's approach was marked by a pragmatic realism that guided his decision-making. He recognized the complexities of international relations and understood the need to navigate competing interests and alliances to protect British influence and security. Canning's willingness to adapt his policies to changing circumstances demonstrated his diplomatic acumen and flexibility—a trait that enabled him to effectively promote liberal principles while safeguarding British interests on the world stage.  Overall, George Canning's foreign policy exemplified a blend of liberal ideals and pragmatic strategies aimed at advancing British interests and promoting stability in a rapidly changing world. His support for national self-determination, free trade, and the balance of power reflected his commitment to liberal values while recognizing the complexities of international politics. Canning's legacy as a statesman lies in his ability to navigate the challenges of his time with a principled yet adaptable approach that continues to resonate in the realm of foreign affairs and diplomacy.""","620"
"Buel Elizabeth C Barney Elizabeth Cynthia Barney ","""Trustfully come thou with me to the far famous city of Neleus, So that, O distaff of ivory cunningly fashioned, I give thee Into the hands of the wife of Nicias, the skilled and the learned! So shalt thou weave mantles for men and transparent tissues for women. And at the sight, O my distaff, shall one woman say to another: Surely great grace lies in trifles, and gifts from friends are most precious! This recalls Alcandras gift of a golden distaff to Helen of Troy; and an interesting companion picture to these ancient Greeks is our own Benjamin Franklin, who thus presents a spinning-wheel to his sister in a letter dated Jan., 736: DEAR, I am highly pleased with the account Captain Freeman gives me of you.

I have been thinking what would be a suitable present for me to make, and for you to receive, as I hear you are grown a celebrated beauty. I had almost determined on a tea-table; but when I consider that the character of a good house-wife was far preferable to that of only being a pretty gentlewoman, I concluded to send you a spinning-wheel, which I hope you will accept as a small token of my sincere love and affection. Sister, farewell, and remember that modesty, as it makes the most homely virgin amiable and charming, so the want of it infallibly renders the most perfect beauty disagreeable and odious. But when that brightest of female virtues shines among other perfections of body and mind, in the same person, it makes the woman more lovely than an angel. Excuse this freedom and use the same with me. I am, dear Jenny, Your loving brother, B.. Compare Franklins sentiments emphasized still further in Poor Richards Almanac: Old Englands Laws the proudest Beauty name When single Spinster, and when married Dame, For Housewifery is Womans noblest Fame. The wisest household Cares to Women yield A large, an useful and a grateful Field. Fancy the horror which would congeal the soul of Poor Richard to-day at the sight of woman stepping boldly outside that large Field of the kitchen and spinning-room! In the eyes of both Greek and American, the woman plying spindle and distaff was more nobly and graciously employed than the spoiled beauty gossiping over the teacups, for, says Richard, Many estates are spoiled in the getting, Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting. Nor should we forget the august Fates themselves, who spin the thread of human destiny, weaving it into the web of universal life, and cutting here and there a thread as each mortal fulfils his allotted hour, And sing to those who hold the vital shears, And turn the adamantine spindle round, On which the fate of gods and men is wound. Here we see the spindle as the emblem of human destiny, and always in the hands of women. Witness the three Norns, likewise, of our own northern ancestors, who sit around the tree Igdrasil and spin out the worlds life on their whirring spindle. If we ask more we need only turn to Homer, the inimitable reflector of the customs of his day. In his verse the spinner lives again, as she spins the fine white linen and gorgeous colored wool. Beautiful are the pictures she weaves into the cloth, stories of gods and demi-gods and heroes. Odysseus, entering the feasting hall of the Phacians, is transfixed with wonder at its splendor; its seats, throughout all their length, were spread with the marvellous work of the Phacian maidens, showing radiant in the torchlight, for the Phacian women far exceeded all others in this household art. Did not the Phacian queen recognize on Odysseus the very garments she herself and her maidens had made? And all the while loyal-hearted Penelope sat at home and wove her web to keep off suitors, not to catch them, though Shakespeare rather sneeringly remarks that all the yarn she spun in Ulysses absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. Evidently spinning and the making of the household garments were not beneath the dignity of royal fingers in those old Greek days. Queenly indeed were these occupations, and right royal these distaffs of ivory and gold, the gifts of kings and poets, the symbols of womans dominion. Was not the wool basket even of Helen of Troy lipped with gold? And in the excavations on the site of Troy to-day are found innumerable spindle-whorls of terra-cotta; and in the later excavations Dr. Schliemann found, twenty-eight feet below the surface in the Royal Mansion, a distaff eleven inches long to which a quantity of blackened woollen thread was still adhering. In those days of war and pillage the garments a man wore were the best tokens of his identity; the handiwork of the matron and her daughters was an individual seal set, as it were, upon the lives of their male relatives; home-made and home-spun were their garments, not turned out by the dozen, ready-made from a factory. Penelope sees through the wiles of the false Odysseus when he describes the garments she had made for the real one. This custom of the matron weaving the household cloth has thus given the Greek poets a favorite means of recognition of lost relatives which is certainly more poetic than the worn-out device of the strawberry-mark on the long-lost brother. Even the water nymphs practise weaving; Circe also, and Calypso; mortals and immortals; yea, the mighty Hercules himself threw down his club and spun for love of Omphale: thus do Greek mythology and literature reflect the importance of spindle and distaff in the home-life of the Greeks, who, as we have learned, recognized the value and the dignity of womans labor in believing it to be under the particular tutelage and protection of the dread daughter of Zeus. The Romans copied the Greeks in this as in many other things. They borrowed the spinster-goddess outright and called her Minerva to hide the plagiarism. Our friend Poor Richard says: When great Augustus ruled the World and Rome, The Cloth he wore was spun and wove at Home, His plyd the Distaff and the Loom. Richard is borne out by another authority, who states that Csar Augustus wore clothes made by his wife or daughter. The hapless Lucretia, wife of Collatinus, Tarquins nephew, and Consul of Rome in 09 B.C., was found spinning when her husband visited her from the camp. Gracious pictures these, of haughty Roman matrons, wives of consuls and emperors, spinning and weaving their husbands togas. It is not often that we get such cosy and homelike thoughts of Rome, whose very name recalls naught but flashing legions and the clash of swords on brass. And the women of the north, where the family was the unit of society and the village was a cluster of homesteads knit together by the ties of kindred was the spinning-wheel heard in this land of our own ancestors? In the poetic diction of the Norsemen, with its expressive double substantives, we find that the maiden is called the linen-folded, that is, she who is clothed or draped in linen. In the saga called Gunnlaug the Worm-tongue, it is written: Dead in mine arms she droopeth, My dear one, gold-rings bearer; For God hath changed the life-days Of this lady of the linen. She who was folded in linen was the maker of that linen; and the beautiful flowing draperies of Norse and Saxon women and the tunics of the men are as true witnesses to their homely occupations as the drapery of the Greeks. Was it not the doom of the warrior maiden Brynhild, the disobedient Valkyr, to become a woman and sit by the fire and spin? For the rough nature of the North revolted from feminine occupations, and this warrior daughter of Wotan saw in spinning only deep humiliation and disgrace. Thus the ancient northern literature is also full of pictures of the women spinning their household linen, spinning their wedding linen, spinning the linen of husbands and sons. Noble ladies in the halls of earl and thane, wives in the lowlier homes of simple freemen, and in the cots of peasant and thrall they all spun and wove for the needs of the home. What music-lover can ever forget Wagners picture of the northern maids of later days assembled in a spinning-bee to spin the wedding linen for one of their number? The merry hum of the wheels so exquisitely copied by orchestra and chorus, interrupted now and then by Sentas plaintive song of the supernatural lover who has drawn her thoughts away from her betrothed, surely this spinning-chorus from the Flying Dutchman will live as long as music lives, and will remain a representative instance of this beautiful northern custom. Again, in the rush-strewn hall of medival knight or baron hung with tapestry, the work of his lady and her dependants, depicting his deeds and those of his ancestors, we read the same tale of the spinning-wheel and distaff with its allied arts of weaving and embroidery. Nay, did she not write history, too, this noble spinster, with her spindle and loom, Who, as she plied the distaff, In a sweet voice and low, Still sang of noble houses, And fights fought long ago? As Helen embroidered the combats of Greeks and Trojans, so now, two thousand years later, Queen Matilda and her maidens are seen spinning and weaving the Norman Conquest of England into the Bayeux Tapestry. Surely the muse Clio might wield spindle as well as stylus as a symbol of her patronage of history. It was no shame to those high-born women to ply the distaff and figure in the songs of chivalry as the makers of all manner of household fabrics. My love to fight the Saxon goes, And bravely shines his sword of steel; A herons feather decks his brows, And a spur on either heel;""","""Role of Women in Spinning""","2165","""In the history of textile production, the role of women in spinning has been fundamental and transformative. Spinning, the process of converting raw fibers into yarn or thread, has been a crucial activity in households and communities for centuries. Women have played a central role in spinning, contributing to the economic sustainability of their families, preserving cultural traditions, and even influencing social and political landscapes. This article explores the significance of women in spinning throughout history, from ancient civilizations to the Industrial Revolution and beyond.  In ancient times, spinning was exclusively a woman's task, deeply rooted in domestic life. Women would spin various natural fibers like wool, cotton, and silk into yarn using basic tools such as spindles and distaffs. These tools required skill, precision, and patience, making spinning a craft that women mastered over time. The yarn produced through spinning was used not only for clothing but also for household items like blankets, rugs, and other textiles essential for daily life.  One of the earliest recorded instances of spinning by women dates back to ancient civilizations like Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece. In these societies, women's expertise in spinning was highly valued, and their skill was often associated with qualities like diligence, creativity, and industriousness. The art of spinning was passed down from generation to generation, becoming a cornerstone of cultural heritage and identity.  During the Middle Ages, spinning continued to be a vital economic activity, especially in rural areas where communities relied on textiles for trade and barter. Women played a significant role in spinning wool, which was a valuable commodity for the burgeoning textile industry. Guilds and spinning circles were formed, where women would gather to spin, socialize, and exchange knowledge and techniques. These gatherings not only fostered community bonds but also provided women with a sense of empowerment and solidarity.  The Renaissance period witnessed a notable shift in spinning practices with the introduction of the spinning wheel. This technological advancement revolutionized the production of yarn, enabling women to increase their output and efficiency. The spinning wheel eased the physical strain of hand spinning, making it more accessible to a wider population of women. As a result, spinning became more widespread, leading to a rise in textile production and trade across Europe.  With the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, spinning underwent further transformation as mechanization replaced manual labor. The invention of the spinning jenny, spinning mule, and later, the spinning frame, revolutionized the textile industry, leading to the mass production of yarn and textiles. While these technological advances boosted efficiency and output, they also marginalized many women spinners who could not compete with the speed and scale of industrial machines.  Despite the industrialization of spinning, many women continued to engage in cottage industry spinning, working from home to supplement their family's income. The cottage spinning industry provided flexibility for women to balance domestic responsibilities with economic contributions. Women would spin yarn for local mills or traders, keeping alive traditional spinning techniques and contributing to the local economy.  In the 19th and 20th centuries, spinning saw a resurgence in interest due to the Arts and Crafts movement and the revival of handcraft traditions. Women artisans and designers embraced spinning as a form of artistic expression, creating unique yarns for textiles, fashion, and decorative items. Spinning became not only a practical skill but also a creative outlet for women to showcase their talent and craftsmanship.  In contemporary times, the role of women in spinning has evolved yet remains significant in various contexts. The resurgence of interest in sustainable practices and handmade goods has sparked a renewed appreciation for hand spinning. Women artisans, fiber artists, and hobbyists continue to explore the art of spinning, blending tradition with innovation to create modern yarns and textiles.  Moreover, women in developing countries play a crucial role in the global textile industry, spinning fibers for mass-produced garments and textiles. While industrialization has shifted much of the spinning process to factories and machines, women in countries like India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia still engage in hand spinning to support their families and communities. Organizations and fair trade initiatives have sought to empower these women spinners by providing fair wages, safe working conditions, and market access for their hand-spun textiles.  The role of women in spinning extends beyond economic contributions to encompass cultural preservation and community resilience. Through spinning, women pass down ancestral knowledge, traditions, and stories to future generations, ensuring the continuity of cultural heritage. Spinning circles, workshops, and festivals celebrate the art of spinning, bringing together women of diverse backgrounds to share skills, stories, and camaraderie.  In conclusion, the role of women in spinning has been integral to the fabric of society, weaving together history, culture, and community. From ancient civilizations to modern times, women have upheld the art of spinning with skill, dedication, and creativity. Whether in traditional cottage industries, artisan workshops, or global supply chains, women continue to shape the narrative of spinning, preserving a timeless craft for generations to come.""","992"
"Phillimore Lucy","""Far more like Sir Christopher was his daughter Jane, who shared his tastes and studies and took a vivid interest in his work. She added to her other accomplishments that of being a very skilful musician. She was never married, but remained all her life her father's affectionate companion. Wren's old friend, Dr. Bathurst of Trinity College, Oxford, appealed to him, in the spring of 692, for help in the buildings which were still going on there. 'Worthy Sir,--When I sent Mr. wait on you with a scheme of our new building, he told me how kindly you was pleased to express your remembrance of me, and that you would send me your thoughts concerning our design; and particularly of the pinnacles, the which as they were superadded to our first draught, so I must confess I would be well content to have omitted with your approbation. The season for our falling to work again will now speedily come on; which makes me the more hasten to entreat from you the trouble of two or three lines in relation to the promises whereby you will farther oblige, 'Sir, your old friend, and ever faithful servant, 'R..' Wren's answer comes promptly, and shows his generous readiness to help the schemes of others, no matter how pressing his own work was. 'Sir,--I am extremely glad to hear of your good health, and, what is more, that you are vigorous and active, and employed in building. I considered the design you sent me of your Chapel which in the main is very well, and I believe your work is too far advanced to admit of any advice: however, I have sent my thoughts, which will be of use to the mason to form his mouldings. 'He will find two sorts of cornice; he may use either. I did not well comprehend how the tower would have good bearing upon that side where the stairs rise. I have ventured a change of the stairs, to leave the wall next the porch of sufficient scantling to bear that part which rises above the roofs adjoining. 'There is no necessity for pinnacles, and those expressed in the printed design are much too slender. 'I have given another way to the rail and baluster, which will admit of a vase that will stand properly upon the pilaster. 'Sir, I wish you success and health and long life, with all the affection that is due from, 'Your obliged, faithful friend, and humble servant, ' WREN. 'P.S. A little deal box, with a drawing in it, is sent by Thomas Moore, Oxford carrier.' In the same year the Church of S. Andrew by the Wardrobe was finished; recent alterations in the city have benefited this building; it now stands well above a flight of steps, with its square tower, and the red brick which contrives to be red and not black, and stone dressings. Two years later Wren rebuilt All Hallows, Lombard Street, on an ancient foundation: outside it is one of his plainest and most solid churches, inside he spent upon it much rich work and curious carving both in stone and wood. S. Michael Royal, College Hill, belongs to this same date, and was built under Wren's directions by Edward Strong, his master-mason. It is a well-lit, handsome church with a tower at one corner, and contains an altar-piece of singular beauty, carved by Grinling Gibbons in 'right wainscot oak.' The old church was founded and made a collegiate church of S. Spiritus and S. Mary by no less a person than Sir Richard Whittington, three times Lord Mayor of London (397, 406, 419), whose fame, with that of his cat, survives in the well-known story. He founded also another college, known as the Whittington College, and endowed it with a divinity lecture 'for ever.' Edward VI., however, suppressed both the colleges and the lecture, though the Whittington College was allowed partially to survive as almshouses for poor men. Whittington was buried in this church, but his monument perished in the Fire. In the following year Wren added a well-proportioned, peculiar steeple, the gift of the parishioners, to the little stone Church of S. Vedast in Foster Lane, a church to which a painful interest now attaches from the recent persecution and imprisonment of its rector, the Rev. T. P. Dale. The church was decorated, as was Wren's custom, with fret-work, carving, and stucco, but is not otherwise remarkable. S. Mary's, Somerset, or Somers'hithe, was likewise finished in this year: a stone church with two aisles surmounted by a handsome cornice and balustrade; its great feature was the beautiful pinnacled tower, which, though the church is gone, still stands a perpetual memorial of that reckless disregard of God's honour, which has counted any common want, any farthing of money, of more importance than the claims of His service, or than gifts solemnly offered to Him. The Cathedral meanwhile grew slowly, though many a hindrance annoyed its architect. The Parliament took part of the fabric money and applied it to the expenses of King William's wars, so that, as Sir Christopher complained, his wings were clipt and the Church was deprived of its ornaments. The organ was another annoyance. Sir Christopher's wish and intention was to place the organ where it now is, on either side of the choir, in order to leave the vista clear from the west door to the altar, which in his design stood grandly raised under a handsome canopy. This was overruled, and the organ was to be placed in a gallery cutting right across the entrance of the choir. With his wonted philosophy, Wren bent his mind to reducing as much as possible the injury to the architectural effect, by keeping the pipes as low as he could. But in the builder of the organ, Bernard Smith, or 'Father' Smith, as he is called, Wren had a difficult person to deal with. Far from lowering the pipes, Smith made them higher than in his estimate, so that the case and ornaments had to be enlarged, and Sir Christopher complained bitterly that the Cathedral 'was spoilt by that box of whistles.' The rival organ builder, Renatus Harris, if indeed he was the author of an anonymous paper, called 'Queries about the S. Paul's Organ, was not sparing in his criticisms. One query asks 'Whether Sir C. Wren wou'd not have been well pleas'd to have receiv'd such a proposal from the organ builder of S. Paul's, as shou'd have erected an organ, so as to have separated twenty foot in the middle, as low as the gallery, and thereby a full and airy prospect of the whole length of the church, and six fronts with towers as high as requisite?' This question is easy enough to answer, and fortunately Wren's wishes have been at last fulfilled by that division of the organ, which now leaves the desired clear view from the great western doors to the altar. Harris, in 712, proposed to erect a great organ over the west doors of the Cathedral, 'study'd to be in all respects made the most artful, costly and magnificent piece of organ-work that ever has hitherto been invented. The use of it will be for the reception of the Queen, on all publick occasions of thanksgivings for the good effect of peace or war, upon all state days, S. Cecilia's Day, the entertainment of foreigners of quality, and artists, and on all times of greatest concourse etc., and by the advice and assistance of Sir C. Wren, the external figure and ornaments may be contrived so proportionable to the order of the building, as to be a decoration to that part of the edifice and no obstruction to any of the rest. Sir Christopher Wren approves it.' Alas! at that time Wren's approval was enough to determine the majority of the commission to reject any plan thus sanctioned, and Renatus Harris's grand design survives on paper alone.: The name is often supposed to originate in the patten-makers who are said to have lived near, but its origin is more probably 'S. Margaret with the Paten.' 'Not,' says Evelyn (Diary, May 8, 688), 'that they were averse to the publisheing of it for want of due tendernesse towards Dissenters. but that the Declaration being founded on such a dispensing power as might at pleasure set aside all laws ecclesiastical, it appeared to them illegal and. a point of such consequence that they could not so far make themselves parties to it as the reading of it in church during the time of Divine Service would have done.' They were sent to the Tower June, for refusing to give bail for their appearance. They refused on the ground that to do so would have prejudiced their peerage. The bishops were Francis Turner of Ely, William Lloyd of S. Asaph, Thomas Ken of Bath and Wells, John Lake of Chichester, Sir Jonathan Trelawney of Bristol, Thomas White of Peterborough, and William Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury.

Born on October 20, 1632, in East Knoyle, Wiltshire, England, Wren is best known for his work following the Great Fire of London in 1666, particularly the redesign and reconstruction of many of the city's churches, including his masterpiece, St. Paul's Cathedral.  Wren's architectural career began in the 1660s when he designed the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford, a grand, classical building that showcased his early talent. However, it was his appointment as the Surveyor of Works for King Charles II in 1669 that catapulted him to architectural fame. Wren was tasked with rebuilding 51 churches in London following the devastating fire that destroyed much of the city. This monumental undertaking not only reshaped the city's skyline but also solidified Wren's reputation as a visionary architect.  One of Wren's most celebrated works is St. Paul's Cathedral, an enduring symbol of London's resilience and architectural excellence. Wren's design for St. Paul's Cathedral is a testament to his mastery of classical architecture, blending elements of Renaissance and Baroque styles to create a timeless masterpiece. The cathedral's iconic dome, inspired by St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, soars above the city, offering a striking contrast to the surrounding buildings.  Beyond St. Paul's Cathedral, Wren's portfolio includes a diverse array of buildings that showcase his versatility and innovative spirit. From the elegant simplicity of the Royal Hospital Chelsea to the grandeur of Hampton Court Palace, Wren's designs reflect a deep understanding of composition, proportion, and craftsmanship. His ability to harmonize form and function is evident in every detail, from the graceful curves of his facades to the intricate stonework that adorns his buildings.  Wren's influence extended far beyond London, with his designs shaping the architectural landscape of cities across England. His work on the Greenwich Hospital, now the Old Royal Naval College, exemplifies his ability to create buildings that are both aesthetically pleasing and practical. The domed entrance hall of the hospital is a striking example of Wren's mastery of light and space, creating a sense of grandeur and elegance that is unmatched.  In addition to his architectural achievements, Wren was also a respected scientist and mathematician, contributing to an array of fields beyond his architectural practice. His interest in astronomy led him to construct the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, establishing it as a center for scientific research and discovery. Wren's experiments in optics and physics laid the groundwork for future advancements in these fields, underscoring his profound impact on the scientific community.  Despite his immense contributions to architecture and science, Wren's legacy extends beyond his professional accomplishments. His dedication to his craft, unwavering commitment to excellence, and innovative spirit continue to inspire architects and creatives around the world. Wren's ability to marry tradition with innovation, his attention to detail, and his pursuit of perfection set him apart as a visionary whose work transcends time and place.  Today, Christopher Wren's buildings stand as a testament to his enduring legacy, inviting visitors to marvel at the beauty and complexity of his designs. Whether exploring the whispering gallery of St. Paul's Cathedral or wandering the cloisters of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, experiencing Wren's architecture is a journey into the past, a glimpse into a world where art, science, and creativity converge in perfect harmony.  In conclusion, Sir Christopher Wren's contributions to architecture and science have left an indelible mark on the world, shaping the landscape of cities and inspiring generations of architects and thinkers. His innovative spirit, meticulous attention to detail, and commitment to excellence continue to resonate today, reminding us of the power of design to uplift, inspire, and endure. Christopher Wren's legacy serves as a beacon of creativity and ingenuity, a guiding light for those who seek to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of architecture and beyond.""","833"
"Bottarelli Ferdinando","""After this, the Romans were engaged in two most difficult and terrible wars, almost at the same time; one in Italy, and the other without. That was called the Social or Marsic war, because the Marsi had been the first beginners of it; for all the Latins, and most of the people of Italy, being disgusted, that they who were sharers in all the hardships and dangers of the war, should be excluded from the honours and dignities of the state; and being frustrated in the hopes of obtaining the freedom of the city by Drusus, endeavoured to compass that by force of arms, which they could not obtain by fair means. They first attempted in the Latin Feri, to assassinate both the consuls, Philip and Csar; but the matter being discovered, they openly revolted, massacred Q. Servilius the proconsul, Fonteius and all the Romans at Asculum. After this the war was carried on with various success. Cn. Pompey Strabo, father of Pompey the Great, distinguished himself upon this occasion. He forced the Vestini and Peligni to submission, and triumphed upon that account. Likewise L. Sylla Csar, the consuls lieutenant, did, by his great successes against the enemy, obtain the consulship, in which he made an end of the war. Soon after broke out a war between the Romans and Mithridates, who having taken off Ariarthes, king of Cappadocia, his sisters husband, together with his son of the same name, had seized upon the kingdom; but being forced to forego what he had unjustly got, Ariobarzanes was nominated king of Cappadocia by the senate, but forced out of his dominions by Mithridates, and restored by Sylla. After this he was once more driven out of Cappadocia by Mithridates, as was likewise Nicomedes out of Bithynia. But both recovered their dominions again by a decree of the senate; which Mithridates being offended at, he invaded Cappadocia and Bithynia, routed the Roman armies, massacred all the Italians, throughout Asia in one day; and reduced Macedon, Thrace, Greece, and Athens. The consul Sylla marching against him, took Athens, and having defeated his generals, forced him to a peace upon the conditions of his quitting Asia, Bithynia, and Cappadocia. incirca Lusitani Spagna battere ignominiosamente sotto condotta Viriato cacciatore diventare ladro di strada sconfiggere armata piu volte sconfitta memorabile altro rotto truppa Vetilio pretore fare mettere morte Appiano solo vinto soffrire fato fortunato contro C.

VII. (Of the World, 966--Of Rome, 66.) Marius, though now broken with age and years, yet being very ambitious of getting employed against Mithridates, could not bear with patience the bestowing that province upon Sylla. Wherefore he prevailed by the means of C. Sulpicius, the tribune of the people, to have it taken from Sylla, and bestowed upon himself. At which Sylla being enraged, seized upon the city, and having slain Sulpicius, obliged Marius to fly. In his absence, Cinna the consul, making a disturbance, was driven out of the city, and being joined by Marius, Carbo, and Sertorius, assaulted Rome; which, having taken, he put a great many of the Romans to the sword. Marius died a natural death the year following. Sylla having made peace with Mithridates, returned into Italy, and made an end of the civil war in two years time, by the defeat of Carbo, Norbanus, young Marius, and others; and being declared dictator, took off a great many of Mariuss party by means of a proscription. Q. Sertorius retired into Farther Spain, where he held out for some years very valiantly.""","""Social War and Roman Conflicts""","1788","""The Social War (91-88 BC), also known as the Italian War, was a pivotal conflict in ancient Rome that erupted due to tensions over Roman citizenship rights. Prior to this war, the Roman Republic granted Roman citizenship to select communities in Italy, while others were denied this privilege. The Italian allies, known as socii, were dissatisfied with this unequal treatment and sought equal status as Roman citizens. Their demands for rights and privileges that came with citizenship led to a series of revolts and ultimately the outbreak of the Social War.  The root cause of the Social War lay in the disparity between those who had Roman citizenship and those who did not. The Roman citizenship brought with it significant advantages, such as the right to vote, own property in Rome, and serve in the Roman military. This stark contrast in benefits fueled resentment among the Italian allies who contributed significantly to Rome's military campaigns but did not enjoy the same rights as Roman citizens.  The conflict began when the socii, feeling marginalized and mistreated, formed an alliance known as the Italia Confederation in a bid to challenge Rome's authority. The socii had a well-organized military and were united in their quest for citizenship rights. Their rebellion posed a significant threat to Rome's dominance in Italy, as they possessed the strength and determination to stand up against the Roman Republic.  The Social War was a brutal and protracted conflict marked by fierce battles and extensive bloodshed. Both sides suffered heavy casualties as they vied for supremacy. The socii, led by prominent figures like Quintus Poppaedius Silo and Gaius Papius Mutilus, demonstrated their military prowess and strategic acumen, putting up a formidable resistance against the Roman forces.  One of the key turning points in the Social War was the Battle of Asculum in 89 BC, where the Roman forces, under the command of Consul Lucius Porcius Cato, faced off against the Italia Confederation. The battle was fiercely contested, with neither side achieving a decisive victory. However, the Roman forces eventually emerged triumphant, dealing a significant blow to the socii's hopes of gaining equal citizenship rights.  As the conflict dragged on, Rome faced mounting pressure both internally and externally. The Roman Senate, realizing the gravity of the situation, decided to address the core issue at the heart of the conflict – the demand for citizenship rights. In 89 BC, Rome passed the Lex Pompeia de Transpadanis, granting Roman citizenship to the socii who had not rebelled, effectively diffusing tensions and weakening the resolve of the remaining rebel forces.  The Social War came to an end in 88 BC with the defeat of the remaining rebel groups. The Italia Confederation crumbled under the might of the Roman legions, and the socii were forced to lay down their arms. The aftermath of the war saw a significant shift in Roman policy towards its Italian allies. The Lex Julia, enacted in 90 BC, extended Roman citizenship to all socii who had not participated in the rebellion, thereby integrating them into the Roman state.  The impact of the Social War reverberated throughout the Roman Republic, signaling a significant change in the dynamics of power and citizenship within the Roman state. The conflict highlighted the challenges of managing diverse communities within the Roman sphere of influence and underscored the importance of addressing grievances to prevent widespread rebellion.  In conclusion, the Social War was a watershed moment in Roman history that reshaped the relationship between Rome and its Italian allies. The conflict underscored the complex nature of citizenship and the struggles for equality within the Roman Republic. By acknowledging the grievances of the socii and extending citizenship rights, Rome not only averted further rebellion but also laid the groundwork for a more inclusive and cohesive Roman society.""","756"
"Southey Robert","""The Swedish and American Consuls told him that the French Consul had your picture and read your letters; and the Doctor thinks one of them, probably, read the letters. By the master's account of the cutter, I would not have trusted an old pair of shoes in her. He tells me she did not sail, but was a good sea-boat. I hope Mr. Marsden will not trust any more of my private letters in such a conveyance: if they choose to trust the affairs of the public in such a thing, I cannot help it.' While he was on this station, the weather had been so unusually severe that he said the Mediterranean seemed altered. It was his rule never to contend with the gales; but either run to the southward to escape their violence, or furl all the sails, and make the ships as easy as possible. The men, though he said flesh and blood could hardly stand it, continued in excellent health, which he ascribed, in great measure, to a plentiful supply of lemons and onions. For himself, he thought he could only last till the battle was over. One battle more it was his hope that he might fight. 'However,' said he, 'whatever happens, I have run a glorious race.' 'A few months rest,' he says, 'I must have very soon. If I am in my grave, what are the mines of Peru to me? But to say the truth, I have no idea of killing myself. I may, with care, live yet to do good service to the state. My cough is very bad, and my side, where I was struck on the 4th of February, is very much swelled: at times a lump as large as my fist, brought on occasionally by violent coughing. But I hope and believe my lungs are yet safe.' He was afraid of blindness and this was the only evil which he could not contemplate without unhappiness. More alarming symptoms he regarded with less apprehension, describing his own 'shattered carcass' as in the worst plight of any in the fleet; and he says, 'I have felt the blood gushing up the left side of my head; and, the moment it covers the brain, I am fast asleep.' The fleet was in worse trim than the men; but when he compared it with the enemy's, it was with a right English feeling. 'The French fleet yesterday,' said he, in one of his letters, 'was to appearance in high feather, and as fine as paint could make them; but when they may sail, or where they may go, I am very sorry to say is a secret I am not acquainted with. Our weather-beaten ships, I have no fear, will make their sides like a plum-pudding.' 'Yesterday,' he says, on another occasion, 'a rear-admiral and seven sail of ships put their nose outside the harbour. If they go on playing this game, some day we shall lay salt on their tails.' Hostilities at length commenced between Great Britain and Spain. That country, whose miserable government made her subservient to France, was once more destined to lavish her resources and her blood in furtherance of the designs of a perfidious ally. The immediate occasion of the war was the seizure of four treasure-ships by the English. The act was perfectly justifiable, for those treasures were intended to furnish means for France; but the circumstances which attended it were as unhappy as they were unforeseen. Four frigates had been despatched to intercept them. They met with an equal force. Resistance, therefore, became a point of honour on the part of the Spaniards, and one of their ships soon blew up with all on board. Had a stronger squadron been sent, this deplorable catastrophe might have been spared: a catastrophe which excited not more indignation in Spain than it did grief in those who were its unwilling instruments, in the English government, and in the English people. On the th of October this unhappy affair occurred, and Nelson was not apprised of it till the twelfth of the ensuing month. He had, indeed, sufficient mortification at the breaking out of this Spanish war; an event which, it might reasonably have been supposed, would amply enrich the officers of the Mediterranean fleet, and repay them for the severe and unremitting duty on which they had been so long employed. But of this harvest they were deprived; for Sir John Orde was sent with a small squadron, and a separate command, to Cadiz. Nelson's feelings were never wounded so deeply as now. 'I had thought,' said he, writing in the first flow and freshness of indignation; 'Fancied--but nay; it must have been a dream, an idle dream; yet I confess it, I DID fancy that I had done my country service; and thus they use me! And under what circumstances, and with what pointed aggravation? Yet, if I know my own thoughts, it is not for myself, or on my own account chiefly, that I feel the sting and the disappointment. No! it is for my brave officers: for my noble minded friends and comrades. Such a gallant set of fellows! Such a band of brothers! My heart swells at the thought of them.' War between Spain and England was now declared; and on the eighteenth of January, the Toulon fleet, having the Spaniards to co-operate with them, put to sea. Nelson was at anchor off the coast of Sardinia, where the Madelena islands form one of the finest harbours in the world, when, at three in the afternoon of the nineteenth, the and frigates brought this long-hoped-for intelligence. They had been close to the enemy at ten on the preceding night, but lost sight of them in about four hours. The fleet immediately unmoored and weighed, and at six in the evening ran through the strait between Biche and Sardinia: a passage so narrow that the ships could only pass one at a time, each following the stern-lights of its leader. From the position of the enemy, when they were last seen, it was inferred that they must be bound round the southern end of Sardinia. Signal was made the next morning to prepare for battle. Bad weather came on, baffling the one fleet in its object, and the other in its pursuit. Nelson beat about the Sicilian seas for ten days, without obtaining any other information of the enemy than that one of their ships had put into Ajaccio, dismasted; and having seen that Sardinia, Naples, and Sicily were safe, believing Egypt to be their destination, for Egypt he ran. The disappointment and distress which he had experienced in his former pursuits of the French through the same seas were now renewed; but Nelson, while he endured these anxious and unhappy feelings, was still consoled by the same confidence as on the former occasion--that, though his judgment might be erroneous, under all circumstances he was right in having formed it. 'I have consulted no man,' said he to the Admiralty; 'therefore the whole blame of ignorance in forming my judgment must rest with me. I would allow no man to take from me an atom of my glory had I fallen in with the French fleet; nor do I desire any man to partake any of the responsibility. All is mine, right or wrong.' Then stating the grounds upon which he had proceeded, he added, 'At this moment of sorrow, I still feel that I have acted right.' In the same spirit he said to Sir Alexander Ball: 'When I call to remembrance all the circumstances, I approve, if nobody else does, of my own conduct.' Baffled thus, he bore up for Malta, and met intelligence from Naples that the French, having been dispersed in a gale, had put back to Toulon. From the same quarter he learned that a great number of saddles and muskets had been embarked; and this confirmed him in his opinion that Egypt was their destination. That they should have put him back in consequence of storms which he had weathered, gave him a consoling sense of British superiority. 'These gentlemen,' said he, 'are not accustomed to a Gulf of Lyons gale: we have buffeted them for one-and-twenty months, and not carried away a spar.' He, however, who had so often braved these gales, was now, though not mastered by them, vexatiously thwarted and impeded; and on February 7th he was compelled to anchor in Pula Bay in the Gulf of Cagliari. From the 1st of January the fleet had remained ready for battle, without a bulk-head up night or day. He anchored here that he might not be driven to leeward. As soon as the weather moderated he put to sea again; and after again beating about against contrary winds, another gale drove him to anchor in the Gulf of Palma on the th of March. This he made his rendezvous: he knew that the French troops still remained embarked; and wishing to lead them into a belief that he was stationed upon the Spanish coast, he made his appearance off Barcelona with that intent. About the end of the month he began to fear that the plan of the expedition was abandoned; and sailing once more towards his old station off Toulon on the th of April, he met the, with news that Villeneuve had put to sea on the last of March, with eleven ships of the line, seven frigates, and two brigs. When last seen they were steering towards the coast of Africa. Nelson first covered the channel between Sardinia and Barbary, so as to satisfy himself that Villeneuve was not taking the same route for Egypt which Gantheaume had taken before him, when he attempted to carry reinforcements thither. Certain of this, he bore up on the th for Palermo, lest the French should pass to the north of Corsica, and he despatched cruisers in all directions. On the 1th he felt assured that they were not gone down the Mediterranean; and sending off frigates to Gibraltar, to Lisbon, and to Admiral Cornwallis, who commanded the squadron off Brest, he endeavoured to get to the westward, beating against westerly winds. After five days a neutral gave intelligence that the French had been seen off Cape de Gatte on the th. It was soon after ascertained that they had passed the Straits of Gibraltar on the day following; and Nelson, knowing that they might already be half way to Ireland or to Jamaica, exclaimed that he was miserable.""","""Naval warfare and strategic challenges""","2201","""Naval warfare has been a critical aspect of military operations throughout history, with the seas and oceans serving as strategic battlegrounds for nations seeking control, influence, and protection. The evolution of naval warfare has been marked by advancements in technology, tactics, and strategies, presenting unique challenges for naval forces to navigate effectively. Understanding the complexities of naval warfare and the strategic challenges it poses is crucial for any nation seeking to maintain maritime dominance and safeguard its interests on the global stage.  One of the fundamental aspects of naval warfare is the control of crucial sea lanes and chokepoints. These strategic points, such as the Strait of Hormuz, Malacca Strait, and the Suez Canal, serve as vital passages for trade, energy resources, and military deployments. Securing these chokepoints is essential for ensuring the flow of goods and resources essential for a nation's economy and military operations. Competing interests and geopolitical tensions often lead to power struggles over these strategic areas, highlighting the importance of naval presence and power projection.  The emergence of advanced naval technologies has transformed the nature of naval warfare, leading to the development of sophisticated naval vessels, submarines, aircraft carriers, and missile systems. These technological advancements provide naval forces with enhanced capabilities in areas such as reconnaissance, long-range precision strikes, and anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies. However, the proliferation of advanced naval technologies also poses challenges in terms of maintaining operational superiority, countering evolving threats, and adapting to new forms of warfare, such as cyber attacks and electronic warfare.  Naval warfare also involves the strategic deployment of naval assets across multiple theaters of operation, requiring effective command and control mechanisms, logistical support, and coordination with other branches of the military. The ability to project power and conduct expeditionary operations in distant regions is crucial for safeguarding national interests, conducting humanitarian missions, and responding to security threats. Navies must strike a balance between forward presence, deterrence, and force projection, considering factors such as resource constraints, political considerations, and potential adversaries' capabilities.  The concept of sea control and sea denial plays a significant role in shaping naval strategies and operations. Sea control refers to a state's ability to dominate key maritime areas, establish maritime superiority, and protect vital sea lines of communication. Achieving sea control requires a robust naval presence, effective use of naval platforms and assets, and the ability to counter threats from adversaries. On the other hand, sea denial focuses on denying the opponent the freedom of movement at sea, disrupting their supply lines, and limiting their operational capabilities. Strategies such as asymmetric warfare, mining, and submarine operations are often employed to achieve sea denial objectives.  Naval warfare also involves addressing asymmetric threats posed by non-state actors, such as pirates, terrorists, and criminal organizations, who exploit the vastness of the maritime domain to engage in illicit activities. Countering these threats requires a combination of maritime security measures, international cooperation, intelligence sharing, and the deployment of naval forces for patrols and interdictions. Asymmetric threats in the maritime domain underscore the need for navies to adapt to non-traditional challenges and collaborate with other agencies to ensure maritime security and stability.  The growing contest for maritime supremacy, particularly in regions like the South China Sea and the Arctic, has intensified strategic competition among major naval powers. China's ambitious naval modernization efforts, including the expansion of its naval capabilities, construction of artificial islands, and assertive behavior in disputed waters, have raised concerns among neighboring countries and traditional maritime powers. The United States, as a dominant naval power, seeks to maintain its naval superiority, uphold freedom of navigation, and reassure allies and partners in the face of evolving security challenges.  Naval warfare in the 21st century is also shaped by environmental factors, such as climate change, maritime pollution, and resource scarcity, which impact naval operations, logistics, and strategic planning. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and changing ocean conditions pose challenges for naval forces in terms of infrastructure resilience, disaster response, and adaptation to environmental changes. As stewards of the maritime environment, navies are increasingly incorporating environmental considerations into their operations and promoting sustainable practices to mitigate the impact of naval activities on marine ecosystems.  In conclusion, naval warfare presents a complex and dynamic battlefield that requires nations to develop comprehensive strategies, invest in cutting-edge technologies, and build agile and adaptable naval forces capable of addressing a wide range of security challenges. The ability to control strategic chokepoints, leverage advanced naval capabilities, coordinate joint operations, and respond to asymmetric threats is essential for maintaining maritime security, protecting national interests, and upholding stability in the global maritime domain. By understanding the nuances of naval warfare and the strategic challenges it entails, nations can position themselves effectively to navigate the evolving seascape of modern warfare.""","950"
"Bennett Charles E  Charles Edwin ","""TO THE. I.. 71.. The names of the Roman months are: Januarius, Februarius, Martius, Aprilis, Majus, Junius, Calends, the first of the month. b) The Nones, usually the fifth of the month, but the seventh in March, May, July, and October. c) The Ides, usually the thirteenth of the month, but the fifteenth in March, May, July, and October.. From these points dates were reckoned backward; consequently all days after the Ides of any month were reckoned as so many days before the Calends of the month next following.. The day before the Calends, Nones, or Ides of any month is designated as pridie Kalendas, Nonas, Idus. The second day before was designated as die tertio ante Kalendas, Nonas, etc. Similarly the third day before was designated as die quarto, and so on. These designations are arithmetically inaccurate, but the Romans reckoned both ends of the series. The Roman numeral indicating the date is therefore always larger by one than the actual number of days before Nones, Ides, or Calends.. In indicating dates, the name of the month is added in the form of an Adjective agreeing with Kalendas, Nonas, Idus. Various forms of expression occur, of which that given underis most common:-- ===================================================================== Days March,May,July January, August April,June, of the October.

Special varieties of Brachylogy are-- a) Zeugma, in which one verb is made to stand for two; as,-- minis aut blandimentis corrupta = (terrifed) by threats or corrupted by flattery. b) Compendiary Comparison, by which a modifier of an object is mentioned instead of the object itself; as,-- dissimilis erat Chares eorum et factis et moribus, lit. Chares was different from their conduct and character i.e. Chares's conduct and character were different, etc.. Pleonasm is an unnecessary fullness of expression; as,-- prius praedicam, lit. I will first say in advance.. Hendiadys, (one through two) is the use of two nouns joined by a conjunction, in the sense of a noun modified by a Genitive or an Adjective; as,-- febris et aestus, the heat of fever; celeritate cursuque, by swift running.. Prolepsis, or Anticipation, is the introduction of an epithet in advance of the action which makes it appropriate; as,-- submersas obrue puppes, lit. overwhelm their submerged ships, i.e. overwhelm and sink their ships. a. The name Prolepsis is also applied to the introduction of a noun or pronoun as object of the main clause where we should expect it to stand as subject of a subordinate clause.

Developed by Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome, the original calendar underwent several revisions over the centuries to match the changing needs of the Roman people. The Roman calendar laid the foundation for many aspects of the modern calendar system we use today, influencing how we structure time and organize events.  The Roman calendar was a lunar calendar, initially divided into ten months beginning in March and ending in December, with each month aligning roughly with the phases of the moon. March, which marked the start of the agricultural year and was considered a month of military activity, was named after Mars, the god of war. The subsequent months were named after various aspects of Roman life, such as Aprilis (from the Latin word """"aperire,"""" meaning to open, symbolizing the opening of flowers), Maius (dedicated to the goddess Maia), and Junius (honoring the goddess Juno).  In the ancient Roman calendar, days were divided into three parts: Kalends, Nones, and Ides. The Kalends marked the first day of the month, while the Nones fell on the fifth or seventh day, depending on the month's length. The Ides typically fell on the 13th day of most months but on the 15th of March, May, July, and October. These divisions helped Romans keep track of time and schedule important events like market days, religious ceremonies, and political assemblies.  One of the most enduring features of the Roman calendar was the custom of naming years after two consuls serving in the Roman Republic. This dating system became known as the consular dating, with the year indicated by the names of the consuls in office at the time. For example, a date might be written as """"the year of Consul A and Consul B."""" This practice was crucial for recording historical events and understanding the chronological order of significant occurrences in Roman history.  As Roman society evolved, so did the calendar. Julius Caesar, in 46 BC, introduced the Julian calendar, a solar calendar based on the length of the Earth's orbit around the sun, which included 365 days in a year with an additional day added every four years (leap year) to account for the extra time. This reform aimed to synchronize the calendar with the seasons and bring more stability to the dating system.  The Julian calendar had twelve months and set the standard for the 365-day year, with a leap year occurring every four years. The names of the months were changed to reflect the deities or numbers associated with each month. For instance, January was named after Janus, the god of beginnings and transitions, while July was named in honor of Julius Caesar himself.  The Julian calendar remained in use for centuries, but over time, a slight discrepancy between the calendar year and the actual solar year emerged due to the calculated length of a year being slightly off. This discrepancy led to the need for further reform, which culminated in the Gregorian calendar introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582.  The Gregorian calendar made adjustments to the Julian calendar by omitting a leap year on century years not divisible by 400. This correction aimed to bring the average year length closer to the solar year, ensuring greater accuracy in tracking time and seasons. The adoption of the Gregorian calendar by various countries over the following centuries led to its widespread use and acceptance as the standard calendar worldwide.  The Roman naming conventions also had a profound impact on Western culture, influencing how we name months, days of the week, and even how we designate time periods. The names of the months in many languages are derived from Latin or Roman gods and rulers, reflecting the enduring influence of Roman tradition on our modern calendar system.  In addition to months, Roman naming conventions extended to the days of the week. The Romans named their days after celestial bodies and gods, a practice that continues in English and many other languages. For example, Monday is named after the Moon (Luna), Tuesday after the god of war (Mars), Wednesday after the chief god (Mercury), Thursday after the god of thunder (Jupiter), Friday after the goddess of love (Venus), Saturday after the god of agriculture (Saturn), and Sunday after the Sun (Sol).  Furthermore, the Roman calendar's legacy is also evident in the dating system widely adopted today. The use of BC (Before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini, meaning """"In the Year of Our Lord"""") to denote time periods is rooted in Roman dating conventions. While there has been a recent trend to use BCE (Before Common Era) and CE (Common Era) as more inclusive alternatives, the original Roman-based system still remains prevalent in many contexts.  In conclusion, the Roman calendar and naming conventions have had a lasting impact on how we organize time, date events, and name periods in our modern society. From the original lunar calendar of ancient Rome to the Julian and Gregorian calendars, the evolution of timekeeping reflects the ingenuity and adaptability of human civilization. The legacy of the Roman calendar lives on in the way we structure our days, months, and years, connecting us to the traditions and practices of one of the most influential empires in history.""","1074"
"Memes J S  John Smythe ","""Again, between the early productions of sculpture in England, when these first attract notice by their excellence, we very decidedly trace the style, and in some instances, as in the beautiful monuments of Eleanor, queen of Edward I., the designs of the school of Pisa. About this time, the very improvements introduced by Giovanni da Pisa, son of Nicolo, especially in the drapery, are decidedly apparent in those and other English works. Hence, although we find English names mentioned as masters of the works in several of our most splendid erections, and even in one instance as sculpturing the images of saints, it is doubtful whether they were not the ecclesiastics directly employed by the chapter to communicate their plans to the actual artificers. But it must also be observed, that the natural consequence of introducing foreign art would be to create native artists. There can be little doubt, therefore, that many of the really fine monuments of our Henrys and Edwards, during the fifteenth century, are the works of home-bred talent. During the sixteenth century, again, we do certainly know that two Italian sculptors, Cavallini, and especially the celebrated Torregiano, were in England, when the latter erected the monument in Henry VII.'s chapel, for which he received so large a sum as a thousand pounds. Henry VIII., again, had for his master of works an Italian sculptor, John of Padua, scholar of Michael Angelo. In 615/8, we at length find a work erected by an Englishman, the monument of the 'good Thomas Sutton,' by Nicholas Stone; and, towards the conclusion of the same era, lived Francis Bird, a native of London, whose labours, however, only show the miserable state of art. Sculpture has never been practised as a separate branch in the early history of Scotland, who appears to have obtained her masters rather from France than Italy. In both countries, our first historians have been most culpably remiss in attention to the progress of native art. On the present occasion, to attempt a detailed account of the scattered notices they have left us, or, what might prove still more satisfactory, an examination of the rich remains we possess, would be irrelevant, as we touch merely upon the general history of the arts, in which our own isolated labours, even at best, form only an episode. Not till towards the conclusion of the last century can there properly be said to have existed a school of British sculpture. Cibber, Roubilac, Scheemakers, Carlini, Locatelli, Rysbrack--all the sculptors who flourished in England during the greater part of the eighteenth century, were foreigners. It is well that the fame of our good and our brave finds a memorial in the records of history, and in the breasts of their countrymen, more worthy of their virtues than these men have often erected, in the noblest, too, of our temples. Now, British worth can be commemorated by British art. Our native school of Sculpture may be considered as commencing with Banks, born in 738, died in 805/8; for Wilton, as an artist, was educated abroad. In power of modelling few have excelled Banks, whose name merits eulogium, and is mentioned by foreign writers as among the very few at Rome, who, previous to the appearance of Canova, presented in their works the dawnings of reviving art. Bacon, born in 740, was in every respect an English artist, and we may almost say self-taught. In simplicity his works have great merit; they are often wanting in feeling. Bacon was not unacquainted with the literature of his art. Proctor and Deare died too early for the arts, after they had given evidence of the highest abilities. Deare has indeed left works, young as he was, not surpassed by any in modern art. We approach our more immediate contemporaries with respectful diffidence, and shall touch only upon the merits of those who are removed from the effects of praise or censure. Nollekins knew his art, but wanted science, dignity, and fancy. Flaxman belongs to posterity, and has more widely extended the influence of his genius--more intimately connected his labours with general improvement, than any other English sculptor. Towards the propitious revolution which rescued the arts from utter imbecility, in the latter end of last century, he largely contributed, by his learned, powerful, and simple style. From 787 to 794, he continued in Italy; and had his sojourn been longer, he would have divided not unequal honors with the great reformer of taste. This is known and acknowledged by the intelligent critics of that country, of whom one of the most judicious, Count Cicognara, thus writes:--'To Flaxman our obligations are very great, since, as far as our acquaintance with his works extends, they served nobly to elevate from a certain monotonous lethargy, and to create afresh, that taste for the severe and golden style of antiquity, which he applied to his own inventions.' From his youth, Flaxman was distinguished by the strength of his genius, by devotion to the study of the ancient models, and by fearless but judicious disregard of those conventional affectations by which art was disgraced. He was among the first, if not the earliest, to awaken the long dormant energies of sculpture, to unite anew art with nature. The simple and the grand of antiquity he made his own; nor, since the best ages of Greece, do we anywhere find, in the works mentioned in these pages, greater meaning, more deep feeling of truth, with less pomp of art, than in the sculpture of Flaxman. The wonderful designs from Homer, the statues of Mr Pitt and Sir Joshua Reynolds, the monuments of Montague, Howe, and Nelson, the group of Michael and Satan, will alone fully justify this character. If, in the works of this master, a defect may be pointed out, it is an excess of the severe and simple, which nearly approaches to harshness. Surpassing both Canova and Thorwaldsen in the loftiness of his conceptions, and perhaps in classic purity of taste, in the graces of composition, and the facilities of modelling, he is inferior to the former. But in all that constitutes the epic of the art, Flaxman is not surpassed. We must omit with regret, though not unadmired, the names of living English artists. To their honor be it remarked, that, at this moment, in rectitude and sobriety of precept, in the walk which has hitherto been followed, where nothing is yet to be unlearned, and which must infallibly conduct to higher perfection, no school in Europe can boast of happier auspices, of more vigorous practice, nor of sounder principles, than the British school of Sculpture. In Italy, the numerous--we may say universal--imitators of Canova, appear to be following, with exaggerated effect, the only failing towards which his style inclines--elaborate grace. In Germany, the art languishes for want of encouragement. Sculpture is more pre-eminently the nursling of freedom. The French sculptors are, at the present time, more distinguished for science than for feeling or invention. They want individuality of character in their works; the symmetry and proportions, the mechanical art of antiquity, their chisel has transferred,--but the sentiment, the essence which unites art with nature, which breathes into Grecian statuary the breath of life, has escaped. It is a singular fact, that from the school formed under the empire, while the most valued treasures of existing art were collected in the French capital, not a sculptor, hardly one artist of eminence, has issued. The cause is plain. These monuments were torn from their resting places by the hand of violence; they were viewed by a vain and mistaken people as the trophies of victory; but they were never venerated with that enthusiastic yet humble devotion, with which the disciple regards the sources of knowledge. During a shorter period, how different have been the effects of our own unsullied and bloodless collection. Since the public exposition of the Phidian Marbles, in particular, every department of taste has been improved, and every artist has been ready to exclaim, with the late venerable president, that till he saw these works, he was ignorant how much of his art he had yet to learn. Let the British sculptor, then, continue in the same principles as have heretofore guided his practice; let him follow nature, and these the noblest remains of art in existence, and he must excel. Sculpture seems especially calculated to flourish amongst us. The grave and manly character of the art agrees with the tone of national genius, harmonizes with our free institutions, and may find in our history sources of the brightest inspiration. THE FINE ARTS.. X. IN the present undertaking, two methods of arrangement are obviously presented: either to treat the arts simultaneously; or, considering each in succession, to commence with that one which seemed best adapted to illustrate the history and common principles of all. With this view we have, in the commencement, followed the fortunes of Sculpture at some length, because here we find an uninterrupted series of monuments; here the elements of imitative art are discoverable in their purest and least compounded character; and also because in Sculpture the labours, being enduring, of greater magnitude, and more generally employed for national purposes than those of Painting, seem more clearly to illustrate the connexion which will ever be found to subsist between the refinement of taste and the progress of moral and political intelligence, as affects nations, or the human race universally. This is the truly dignified object in the history of the fine arts. In this respect our inquiries have been most satisfactorily resolved.""","""History of British Sculpture""","2060","""British sculpture boasts a rich and varied history that reflects the artistic, cultural, and social developments of the nation. From ancient times to the contemporary period, sculptors in Britain have produced works that embody a wide range of styles, themes, and techniques. The evolution of British sculpture is a testament to the creativity and innovation of its artists, as well as the influences of international movements and local traditions.  The roots of British sculpture can be traced back to prehistoric times when ancient Britons created stone carvings and monuments such as Stonehenge and the Avebury Stone Circles. These early works demonstrate a connection to nature, spirituality, and community, themes that would continue to resonate throughout the history of British sculpture.  In the Roman period, Britain was influenced by the classical traditions of sculpture, exemplified by the sculptures found at Hadrian's Wall and other Roman sites. These works often depicted mythological figures, emperors, and deities, showcasing the skill and artistry of Roman sculptors working in Britain.  The medieval period saw the rise of monumental sculpture in the form of tombs, effigies, and religious carvings in churches and cathedrals across the country. The development of Gothic architecture provided a framework for sculptors to create intricate stone carvings that told stories from the Bible and honored the deceased.  The Renaissance brought a revival of classical ideals to Britain, with artists such as Nicholas Stone and Grinling Gibbons producing exquisite marble carvings and woodwork influenced by the works of Italian masters like Michelangelo and Bernini. This era marked a shift towards a more naturalistic and dynamic approach to sculpture, as seen in the lifelike portraits and decorative elements of the period.  The 18th and 19th centuries witnessed a golden age of British sculpture, with artists like John Flaxman, Francis Chantrey, and Alfred Stevens gaining prominence for their neoclassical and romantic works. Public monuments, commemorative sculptures, and portrait busts became popular, reflecting the patriotic and sentimental spirit of the times.  The Victorian era saw a diversification of styles in British sculpture, with the emergence of the New Sculpture movement led by artists such as Alfred Gilbert and Hamo Thornycroft. Sculptors explored themes of nature, mythology, and social commentary, creating dynamic and expressive works that captured the spirit of the age.  In the 20th century, British sculpture underwent a radical transformation with the advent of modernism and avant-garde movements. Artists like Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, and Anthony Caro pushed the boundaries of traditional sculpture, experimenting with abstraction, form, and materials to create innovative and groundbreaking works.  The post-war period saw a proliferation of public art projects and monumental sculptures in Britain, reflecting the rebuilding and rejuvenation of the country after World War II. Sculptors like Eduardo Paolozzi, Lynn Chadwick, and Elisabeth Frink embraced new technologies and materials to create bold and provocative works that challenged conventions and explored the human condition.  Contemporary British sculpture continues to thrive in the 21st century, with artists like Anish Kapoor, Antony Gormley, and Rachel Whiteread gaining international acclaim for their conceptual, experimental, and socially engaged works. Public art installations, site-specific sculptures, and multimedia projects have expanded the boundaries of what sculpture can be, inviting viewers to interact with art in new and unexpected ways.  In conclusion, the history of British sculpture is a testament to the talent, creativity, and diversity of artists working in the medium. From ancient stone carvings to postmodern installations, British sculpture has evolved and adapted to reflect the changing tastes, values, and aspirations of society. By exploring the rich and varied heritage of British sculpture, we gain insight into the artistic traditions, cultural influences, and historical developments that have shaped this dynamic and enduring art form.""","776"
"Miller Hugh","""It may not seem equally obvious, however, how there should be a lack of representation, not only among our members of Parliament, but also among our members of Council. They at least surely belong, it may be said, to the middle classes, by whom and from among whom they are chosen for their office. Certainly in some cases they do; in many others, however, they form a class scarce less peculiar than those upper classes out of which the legislators of the country come to be drawn, simply because there is no other class in the field out of which they can be selected. The Reform and Municipality Bills wrought a mighty change in the Town Councils of the kingdom. The old close burgh system, with all its abuses, ceased for ever, save in its remains--monumental debts, and everlasting leases of town lands, granted on easy terms to officials and their friends; and droll recollections, like those embalmed by Galt in our literature, of solid municipal feasting, and not so solid municipal services,--of exclusive cliqueships, misemployed patronages, modest self-elections,--in short, of a general practice of jobbing, more palpable than pleasant, and that tended rather to individual advantage than corporate honour. The old men retired, and a set of new men were elevated by newly-created constituencies into their vacated places, to be disinterested on dilapidated means, and noisy on short commons. The days of long and heavy feasts had come to a close, and the days of long and heavy speeches succeeded. No two events which this world of ours ever saw, led to so vast an amount of bad speaking as the one Reform Bill that swept away the rotten burghs, and the other Reform Bill that opened the close ones. By and by, however, it came to be seen that the old, privileged, self-elected class were succeeded in many instances by a class that, though elected by their neighbours, were yet not quite like their neighbours. Their neighbours were men who, with their own personal business to attend to, had neither the time nor the ambition to be moving motions or speaking speeches in the eye of the public, and who could not take the trouble to secure elections by canvassing voters. The men who had the time, and took the trouble, were generally a class ill-hafted in society, who had high notions of reforming everything save themselves, and of keeping right all kinds of businesses except their own. The old state of things was, notwithstanding its many faults, a state under which our Scotch burghers rose into consideration by arts of comparative solidity. A tradesman or shopkeeper looked well to his business,--became an important man in the market-place and a good man in the bank,--increased in weight in the same proportion that his coffers did so, and grew influential and oracular on the strength of his pounds sterling per annum. With altered times, however, there arose a new order of men,-- 'The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame.' It was no longer necessary to spend the greater part of a lifetime in acquiring money and character: a glib tongue, a few high professions of public principle, and a few weeks' canvassing, were found to serve the turn more than equally well. There commenced straightway a new dynasty of dignities and honours. Councillors got into print in the capacity of speechmakers, who, save for the revolution effected, would never have got into print in any other capacity than, mayhap, that of bankrupts in the Gazette. Eloquent men walked to church in scarlet, greatly distinguished as provosts and bailies, who but for the happy change would have crept unseen all their lives long among the crowd. Members of Parliament went arm-in-arm, when they visited their constituencies, with folk altogether unused to such consideration; and when a burgher's son sought to be promoted to the excise, or a seaman to the coast-guard service, it was through the new men that influence had to be exerted. And of course the new men had to approve themselves worthy of their honours, by making large sacrifices for the public weal. They had in many cases not much to do: the magistracy of the bygone school, whom they succeeded, had obligingly relieved posterity of the trouble of having a too preponderous amount of municipal property to manage and look after; but if they had not much to do, they had at least a great deal to say; and as they were ambitious of saying it, their own individual concerns were not unfrequently neglected, in order that their constituencies might be edified and informed. In cases not a few, the natural consequences ensued. We have in our eye one special burgh in the north, in which every name in the Town Council, from that of the provost down to that of the humblest councillor, had, in the course of some two or three years, appeared also in the Gazette; and the previous provost of the place had got desperately involved with the branch banks of the district, and had ultimately run the country, to avoid a prosecution for forgery. Let it not be held that we are including the entire tribe of modern town functionaries in one sweeping condemnatory description. We ourselves, in our time (we refer to the fact with a high but surely natural pride), held office as a town councillor, under the modern regime, for the space of three whole years in a parliamentary burgh that contained no fewer than forty voters. All may learn from history how it was that Bailie Weezle earned his municipal honours during the ancient state of things in the famous burgh of Gudetown. 'Bailie Weezle,' says Galt, 'was a man not overladen with worldly wisdom, and had been chosen into the Council principally on account of being easily managed. Being an idle person living on his money, and of a soft and quiet nature, he was, for the reason aforesaid, taken by one consent among us, where he always voted on the provost's side; for in controverted questions every one is beholden to take a part, and the bailie thought it was his duty to side with the chief magistrate.' Our own special qualifications for office were, we must be permitted in justice to ourselves to state, different from Bailie Weezle's by a shade. It was generally held, that if there was nothing to do we would do nothing, and if nothing to say we would say nothing; and so thoroughly did we fulfil every expectation that had been previously formed of us, that for three years together we said and did nothing in our official capacity with great eclat, and regularly absented ourselves from every meeting of Council except the first, to the entire satisfaction of our constituency. It will not be held, therefore, in the face of so important a fact, that we include in our description all the town magistracies under the existing state of things, and most certainly not all modern town councillors. Nothing, however, can be more certain, we repeat, than that they differ from their constituencies as a class, and that they are chosen to represent them in municipal affairs, just as another and higher class is chosen to represent them in the Legislature--merely because there is no other class in the field. The solid middle-class men of business have, as has been said, something else to employ them, and cannot spare their services. They cannot accept of mere notoriety, with mayhap a modicum of patronate influence attached, as an adequate price for the time and labour which their own affairs demand. It is a peculiar class in the municipal as in the literary field, that 'weigh solid pudding against empty praise,' and come to regard the empty praise as solid enough to outweigh the pudding. Not but that it is a fine thing to be in a Town Council, and to see one's fortnightly speeches flourishing in the public prints. Where else could some of our Edinburgh worthies bring themselves so prominently before the eyes of the country? Where else, for instance, could Councillor -- impart such universal interest to the fact that he taught in a Sabbath school, and rode out of town every evening to attend to its duties by a Sunday train,--thus forming an invariable item, it would seem, in the average of the ninety-two Sabbath journeyers that travelled by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, and failed to remunerate the proprietors? Or where else could Councillor -- refer with such prodigious effect to Dr. Chalmers's bloody-minded scheme of 'executing the heathen?' Or where else could Councillor -- succeed in eliciting so general a belief that he was one of the poor endangered heathens over which the threatened execution hung, through his famous oath 'By Jupiter?' By the way, is this latter gentleman acquainted with Smollett's story of the eccentric Mr. H., and chivalrously bent, on the same principle, in acknowledging a deity in distress? 'Mr. H., some years ago, being in the Campidoglio at Rome,' says Smollett, 'made up to the bust of Jupiter, and bowing very low, exclaimed, in the Italian language, 'I hope, sir, if ever you get your head above water again, you will remember that I paid my respects to you in your adversity.' This sally,' continues the historian, 'was reported to the Cardinal Camerlengo, and by him laid before the Pope Benedict XIV., who could not help laughing at the extravagance of the address, and said to the Cardinal, 'Those English heretics think they have a right to go to the devil in their own way.' Now, standing, as we do, either on the threshold of serious national controversies of a religious bearing, or already entered upon them, it would be well to mark and test the facts which it is our present object specially to point out. It would be well to take measures for rendering it an as palpable as it is a solid truth, that the municipal tail of the country's representation no more really represents it in several very important respects than its parliamentary head.""","""Representation in Municipal Government""","2103","""Representation in municipal government plays a crucial role in ensuring that diverse voices are heard and that the needs of all community members are met. Municipal governments are the level of government closest to the people, responsible for providing essential services like public safety, utilities, transportation, and recreation. Having adequate representation in municipal government is vital as it can influence policies and decisions that directly impact the day-to-day lives of residents. In this discussion, we will explore the importance of representation in municipal government, challenges to achieving diversity, strategies for improving representation, and the benefits of a more inclusive government.  One of the primary reasons why representation in municipal government is vital is that it fosters inclusivity and diversity. A diverse governing body can better understand and address the unique challenges faced by different communities. When residents from various backgrounds, including racial, ethnic, gender, age, socioeconomic, and cultural diversity, are represented in municipal government, policies and services can be tailored to meet the needs of a wider range of constituents. This inclusivity helps build trust between the government and the community, leading to better decision-making processes and outcomes.  However, achieving diversity and representation in municipal government is not without its challenges. One significant barrier is the lack of diverse candidates running for office. Structural inequalities, socio-economic disparities, and institutional biases can all contribute to the underrepresentation of certain groups in local government. Additionally, the financial costs associated with running a political campaign can deter individuals with limited resources from seeking elected positions. Furthermore, implicit biases and societal norms may affect voter perceptions and preferences, making it challenging for underrepresented groups to win elections.  To address these challenges and improve representation in municipal government, several strategies can be implemented. One approach is to actively recruit and encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to run for office. Providing training, mentorship, and networking opportunities can help potential candidates navigate the political landscape and build the skills needed to run successful campaigns. Creating outreach programs that engage diverse communities and educate them about the importance of civic participation can also help increase political representation.  Moreover, implementing policies such as campaign finance reform and mandating diverse candidate slates can help level the playing field and reduce financial barriers to entry. Adopting electoral systems like ranked-choice voting or proportional representation can also promote greater diversity in elected bodies by ensuring that minority voices are represented. Additionally, promoting transparency in the electoral process and combating misinformation can help build trust in the political system and encourage more people to participate in local government.  The benefits of having a more diverse and inclusive municipal government are manifold. Firstly, diverse representation can lead to more equitable outcomes in decision-making processes, ensuring that policies address the needs of all residents, not just a select few. Different perspectives and experiences can bring innovative solutions to complex problems and help create a more responsive and inclusive government.  Furthermore, diverse representation can enhance the legitimacy of the government in the eyes of the community. When people see themselves reflected in their elected officials, they are more likely to trust the government and actively engage in civic life. This trust can help foster cooperation between the government and residents, leading to more effective governance and better outcomes for the community as a whole.  In conclusion, representation in municipal government is essential for creating an inclusive, responsive, and effective governing body. By addressing the challenges to diversity, implementing strategies to promote representation, and recognizing the benefits of inclusivity, municipalities can create a more equitable and just political system. Ultimately, diverse representation not only strengthens democracy but also leads to better outcomes for communities by ensuring that all voices are heard and valued in the decision-making process.""","708"
"Sachs Julius","""The case is still worse in many respects in Schachts work already mentioned, Die Pflanzenzelle of 85/82, where under the heading Kinds of vegetable cells the histology is discussed in the following co-ordinated sections; the swarm-filaments of Cryptogams, the spores of the same, pollen-grains, cells and tissue of Fungi and Lichens, cells and tissue of Algae, parenchyma and its cells, vessels of the plant, wood and its cells, bast-cells, stomata, appendicular organs of the epidermis, cork; then follows a paragraph on the thickening-ring, and then to the no small astonishment of the reader comes an account of the vascular bundles, after the vessels, the wood, and the bast-cells have been already dismissed. That such a mode of presenting the subject is due to the little insight possessed by the writer into the structure of the plant as a whole is apparent from simply reading the book, and a similar confusion of ideas is found in his text-book of 85/86. We find a much better classification of tissues in 85/85/8 in Ungers Anatomie und Physiologie der Pflanzen; an account of cells is followed by a description of cell-complexes, as one of the chief divisions of the book, and herein of cell-families, cell-tissues, and cell-fusions. Another chief section is occupied with cell-groups, and here epidermal formations, air-spaces, sap-receptacles, glands and vascular bundles are noticed; here certainly the fact has been overlooked that vascular bundles may be co-ordinated with epidermal formations, but not air-spaces, sap-receptacles and glands. His last chief division gives an account of tissue-systems and of the way in which the vascular bundles are united together in different plants, and secondary growth in thickness and the activity of the cambium-layer are described quite in the right connection. In this branch of the science, as in every case where it is a question of establishing fundamental conceptions, of surveying facts from extensive points of view, and of seeking the requisite principles by means of the history of development, we find that it is Nageli who opens the way and lays the foundation. In his Beitrage zur wissenschaftlichen Botanik of 85/88, he proposed a classification of tissues from purely morphological points of view. His first division was into generating and permanent tissue; in each section he distinguished two forms, prosenchymatous and parenchymatous tissue. Parenchymatous generating tissue, the original component of every young organ, he named primary meristem as distinguished from prosenchymatous generating tissue, which is differentiated in the form of strands and layers, and received from him the general name of cambium; this was certainly not a happy distinction, because Nagelis cambium by no means consists entirely of prosenchymatous tissue. By the term secondary meristem Nageli designated the tissue-strands and tissue-layers which are formed between the permanent tissue of older parts. The cambium he regards as the first product of the primary meristem. The second chief form, permanent tissue, he divides into two classes, not according to the form of the cells or physiological relations, but according to its origin; all permanent tissue, which is derived immediately from primary meristem, is protenchyma, all that comes directly or indirectly from cambium is epenchyma. And since the tissue-strands, till then known as vascular bundles, do not contain vessels only but always fibrous elements also, as Bernhardi had shown in 805/8, Nageli thought that they should therefore be called fibrovascular strands. If it cannot be denied that the obvious distinction between epidermal and other tissue did not find suitable expression in this classification, and though other points of view may at the present day be proposed for the genetic arrangement of tissues, yet Nagelis classification and terminology have the merit of having for the first time exhibited the general histology of plants on comprehensive and genetic principles. It contributed materially to impart a better understanding of the collective structure of plants. The vascular bundles or fibrovascular strands especially demanded further investigation of the genetic and morphological kind; for a correct insight into the origin and subsequent transformation of this tissue-system is as important for phytotomy as a similar knowledge with respect to the bony system in vertebrate animals is for zootomy. But a knowledge of the vascular bundles and their course in the stem has a special importance in phytotomy, because it is the only way to the understanding of secondary growth in thickness in true woody plants. It was noticed above, that von Mohl had proved in 831 the separate character of the bundles which begin in the stem and bend outwards into the leaves where they end, so that the entire system of bundles in a plant consists of single bundles isolated when formed and subsequently brought into connection with one another. Nageli had already examined the corresponding circumstances in the vascular Cryptogams in 846, when Schacht took the retrograde step of making the vascular system in the plant originate in repeated branching, instead of in subsequent blending of isolated strands; Mohl declared unhesitatingly against this mistake in 85/88, but it was refuted at greater length and still more clearly by Johannes Hanstein in 85/87, and by Nageli in 85/88. Hanstein in a treatise on the structure of the ring of wood in Dicotyledons confirmed Nagelis previous statements, and proved in the case of Dicotyledons and Conifers that the first woody circle in the stem is formed from a number of vascular bundles, which are identical with those of the leaves and originate in the primary meristem of the bud. These primordial bundles pass downwards through a certain number of internodes in the stem independent and separate, and either retain their isolation to the point where they end below or unite with adjacent bundles which originated lower down. Hanstein happily termed the portions of the vascular bundles, which enter the stem from the base of the leaf and traverse a certain portion of it in a downward direction, leaf-traces, so that it may be stated briefly, that the primary wood-cylinder in Dicotyledons and Conifers consists of the sum of the leaf-traces. Nagelis observations were of a more comprehensive character, and supplied, as we have seen, a terminology for tissues. He distinguished three kinds of vascular bundles according to their course; the common bundles, which represent Hansteins leaf-traces in the stem, and whose upper ends bend outwards into the leaves; the cauline bundles, which extend above to the punctum vegetationis of the stem without bending outwards into leaves; and leaf-bundles, which belong to the leaves only. He laid it down as a general rule as regards the common bundles in Dicotyledons and Conifers that they begin to form where their ascending and descending halves meet, at the spot therefore where they bend outwards into the leaf, and continue to form as they descend into the stem and ascend into the leaf by differentiation of suitable tissue. It follows from the nature of these common bundles, that a more thorough understanding of their course and origin presupposes a more accurate knowledge of the order of formation of the leaves at the end of the stem and of the changes in the phyllotaxis during growth; these relations Nageli took into detailed consideration, and even derived from them new points of view for the examination of the genetic arrangement of leaves, pointing out at the same time the unsatisfactory nature of the principles of the doctrine propounded by Schimper and Braun. Nageli was also the first who compared the anatomical structure of roots with that of stems, and drew attention to the peculiar character of the fibrovascular body in these organs. As his previous discovery of the apical cell and its segmentation promoted further research, so now his treatise on fibrovascular strands called forth many others from various quarters; among them that of Carl Sanio on the composition of the be mentioned as one of the first and most important, and as serving in conjunction with the works of Hanstein and Nageli to throw light upon the processes of growth in thickness of stems. It has been already said that neither von Mohl nor Schleiden, neither Schacht nor Unger succeeded in finding the true explanation of growth in thickness. It was impossible that they should do so, for they were insufficiently acquainted with the origin, true course, and composition of the vascular bundles before growth in thickness commences; the study of the subject was greatly perplexed by the confounding together in thought and language of totally different things which came under consideration, the so-called thickening-ring, in which the first vascular bundles were supposed to originate close under the summit of the stem, being confounded with the cambium of true woody plants which is formed at a much later period, and both of them again with the very late-formed meristem-layer in arborescent Liliaceae, in which new vascular bundles are continually being produced and cause a peculiar enlargement of the stem.""","""Plant histology and tissue classification""","1891","""Plant Histology and Tissue Classification:  Plant histology is the study of plant tissues at a microscopic level, delving into their structure, function, and organization. Understanding plant histology is crucial for comprehending how plants grow, develop, and interact with their environment. Plants are made up of various types of tissues, each serving a specific purpose in the plant's overall physiology. These tissues work together to support the plant's structure, transport nutrients and water, facilitate photosynthesis, and provide defense mechanisms. Let's explore the diverse world of plant tissues and their classification in detail.  Plant tissues are broadly classified into two main types: Meristematic and Permanent tissues. Meristematic tissues are actively dividing cells responsible for growth and development, found in regions of the plant known as meristems. These tissues give rise to new cells that differentiate into various types of permanent tissues. Permanent tissues, on the other hand, are composed of mature, specialized cells that have lost the ability to divide. These tissues perform specific functions within the plant and are further categorized into three types: Dermal, Ground, and Vascular tissues.  Dermal tissues form the outer protective covering of the plant, serving as a barrier against physical damage and pathogens. The outermost layer of dermal tissue, called the epidermis, is typically a single layer of cells that secrete a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Stomata, specialized openings in the epidermis, regulate gas exchange and transpiration. Trichomes, hair-like structures on the epidermis, can provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss through reflection of sunlight.  Ground tissues make up the bulk of the plant body and perform diverse functions such as photosynthesis, storage, and support. Parenchyma cells, the most common type of ground tissue, are thin-walled cells involved in photosynthesis, storage, and wound healing. Collenchyma cells have thicker cell walls and provide structural support to growing parts of the plant. Sclerenchyma cells, with thick, lignified cell walls, offer rigidity and strength to mature parts of the plant.  Vascular tissues are responsible for transporting water, nutrients, and organic compounds throughout the plant. The two main types of vascular tissues are xylem and phloem. Xylem tissue conducts water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant and provides structural support. Xylem consists of tracheids and vessel elements that are dead at maturity, connected end-to-end to form continuous tubes. Phloem tissue, on the other hand, transports organic compounds such as sugars produced during photosynthesis to various parts of the plant. Phloem consists of sieve tubes and companion cells that maintain the flow of nutrients.  Within these broad categories of tissues, plants exhibit remarkable diversity in cell types, structures, and functions, allowing them to adapt to different environmental conditions. For example, storage tissues like the parenchyma cells in roots and tubers store carbohydrates for future use, while the thick-walled sclerenchyma fibers in plant stems provide mechanical strength. The complexity and specialization of plant tissues contribute to their ability to thrive in various ecosystems and respond to changing environmental cues.  In conclusion, plant histology and tissue classification provide valuable insights into the inner workings of plants at a cellular level. By studying the organization and function of different plant tissues, researchers can unravel the mechanisms behind growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli. The intricate interplay between meristematic and permanent tissues, dermal, ground, and vascular tissues underscores the complexity of plant biology and highlights the adaptability of plants in diverse habitats. A deeper understanding of plant histology not only enriches our knowledge of plant biology but also opens doors to innovative research in agriculture, ecology, and biotechnology.""","769"
"Phillips Percy","""This induced electric field is always of such a kind as to delay the change in the original electric field; if the original field is becoming weaker the induced field is in the same direction, thus delaying the weakening, and if the original field is becoming stronger the induced field is in the opposite direction, thus delaying the increase. Momentum of Moving Electric Field.--Imagine now a small portion of an electric field moving at a steady speed; it will produce, owing to its motion, a steady magnetic field. If now the motion be stopped, the magnetic field will be destroyed, and the change in the magnetic field will produce an electric field so as to delay the change, i.e. so as to continue the original motion. The moving electric field thus has momentum in exactly the same way as a moving mass has. The parallel between the two is strictly accurate. The mass has energy due to its motion, and in order to stop the mass this energy must be converted into some other form of energy and work must therefore be done. The electric field has energy due to its motion--the energy of the magnetic field--and therefore to stop the motion of the electric field, the energy of the magnetic field must be converted into some other form, and work must therefore be done. One consequence of the momentum of a moving mass is well illustrated by the pendulum. The bob of the pendulum is in equilibrium when it is at its lowest point, but when it is displaced from that point and allowed to swing, it does not swing to its lowest point and stay there, but is carried beyond that point by its momentum. The work done in displacing the bob soon brings it to rest on the other side, and it swings back again only to overshoot the mark again. The friction in the support of the pendulum and the resistance of the air to the motion makes each swing a little smaller than the one before it, so that ultimately the swing will die down to zero and the pendulum will come to rest at its lowest point. The graph of the displacement of the bob at different times will therefore be something like Fig. 8. Should the pendulum be put to swing, not in air, but in some viscous medium like oil, its vibrations would be damped down very much more rapidly, and if the medium be viscous enough the vibrations may be suppressed, altogether, the pendulum merely sinking to its lowest position. Electric Oscillation.--These conditions have their exact counterpart in the electric field. To understand them, three properties of lines of force must be borne in mind: (i.) lines of force act as if in tension and therefore always tend to shorten as much as possible; (ii.) the ends of lines of force can move freely on a conductor; (iii.) lines of force in motion possess momentum. Now imagine two conducting plates A and B, Fig. 9, charged positively and negatively, and therefore connected by lines of force as indicated. Let the two plates be suddenly connected by the wire w, so that the ends of the lines of force may freely slide from A to B or vice-versa, and therefore all the lines will slide upwards along A and B, and then towards each other along w, until they shrink to zero somewhere in w. The condition of equilibrium will evidently be reached when all the lines have thus shrunk to zero, but the lines which are travelling from A towards B will have momentum and will therefore overshoot the equilibrium condition and pass right on to B. That is, the positive ends of the lines will travel on to B, and similarly the negative ends will pass on to A. The lines of force between A and B will therefore be reversed. The tension in the lines will soon bring them to rest, and they will slide back again, overshoot the mark again, reach a limit in the original direction and still again slide back. The field between A and B will therefore be continually reversed, but each time its value will be a little less, until ultimately the vibrations will die down to zero. Thus if we were to replace the displacement in Fig. 9 by the value of the field between A and B we should have an exactly similar graph. The amount by which the oscillations are damped down will depend upon the character of the wire w. If it is a very poor conductor it will offer a large resistance to the sliding of the lines along it, and the vibrations will be quickly damped down or, if the resistance is great enough, be suppressed altogether. This rapid alternation of the electric field will send out electromagnetic waves which die down as the oscillations decrease. The Spark Discharge.--In practice the wire w is not actually used, but the air itself suddenly becomes a conductor and makes the connection. When the electric field at a point in the air exceeds a certain limiting strength, the air seems to break down and suddenly become a conductor and remains one for a short time. This breaking down is accompanied by light and heat, and is known as the spark discharge or electric spark. Experiments of Hertz.--In the brilliant experiments carried out by Hertz at Karlsruhe between 886 and 891, he not only demonstrated the existence of the waves produced in this way, but he showed that they are reflected and refracted like ordinary light, he measured their wave-length and roughly measured their speed, this latter being equal to the speed of light within the errors of experiment. One arrangement used by Hertz is shown in plan in Fig. 0. A Ruhmkorff coil R serves to charge the two conductors A and B until the air breaks down at the gap G, and a spark passes. Before the spark is produced, the lines of force on the lower side of AB will in form be something like the dotted lines in the figure, but as soon as the air becomes a conductor, the positive ends of the lines will surge from A towards B and on to B, and the negative ends will surge on to A. These to and fro surgings will continue for a little while, but will gradually die out. As the surgings are all up and down AB, the electric vibrations in the electromagnetic waves sent out will all be parallel to AB, and therefore they will be polarised. This is characteristic of all electric waves, as no single sparking apparatus will produce anything but waves parallel to the spark gap. The electric vibrations coming up to a conductor placed in the position of the wire rectangle, M, will cause surging of the lines along it, and, if these surgings are powerful enough, will cause a spark to pass across the small gap S. Such a rectangle was therefore used by Hertz as a detector of the waves, but since that time many detectors of very much greater sensitiveness have been devised. Reflection.--In order to show that these waves are reflected in the same way as light waves, Hertz placed the sparking knobs, G, at the focus of a large parabolic metallic reflector, and his detector, D, at the focus of a similar reflector placed as in Fig. 1, but much farther away (cf. Fig. ). In this position sparking at G produced strong sparking in the detector, although the distance was such that no sparking was produced without the reflectors. Refraction.--The refraction of the waves was shown by means of a large prism made of pitch. This had an angle of 0 and was about. metres high and. metres broad. Setting it up as shown in plan in Fig. 2, strong sparking was produced in the detector, thus showing that the rays of electric waves were deflected by 2 on passing through the prism. Moving the mirror and detector in either direction from the line LM, made the sparks decrease rapidly in intensity, so that the exact position of LM can be determined with considerable definiteness. Wave-length, by Stationary Waves.--The wave-lengths of the oscillations were found by means of what are known as stationary waves. When two exactly similar sets of waves are travelling in opposite directions over the same space, they produce no effects at certain points called nodes. These nodes are just half a wave-length apart. Their production can be understood by reference to Fig. 3. The dotted lines represent the two waves which are travelling in the direction indicated by the arrows. In A the time is chosen when the waves are exactly superposed, and the resultant displacement will be represented by the solid line. The points marked with a cross will be points at which the displacement is zero. In B each wave has travelled a distance equal to a quarter of a wave-length, and it will be seen that the two sets of waves cause equal and opposite displacements. The resulting displacement is therefore zero, as indicated by the solid line. In C the waves have travelled another quarter of a wave-length and are superposed again, but in this case the displacements will be in the opposite directions from those in A. In D, still another quarter wave-length has been traversed by each wave, and another quarter wave-length would bring back the position A. In E, we have the successive positions of the wave drawn in one diagram, and we notice that the points indicated by a cross are always undisplaced and their distance apart is one-half a wave-length. Hertz produced these conditions by setting up his coil and sparking knobs at some distance from a reflecting wall, Fig. 4. Then the waves which are coming up to the wall and those which are reflected from the wall will be travelling in opposite directions over the same space. True, the reflected waves will be rather weaker than the original ones, so that there will be a little displacement even at the nodes, but there will be a well-marked minimum.""","""Electromagnetic Waves and Their Behavior""","1973","""Electromagnetic waves are a fundamental aspect of physics, playing a crucial role in our everyday lives and various technological advancements. These waves are a form of energy that moves through space at the speed of light, carrying both electric and magnetic components perpendicular to each other. Understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves is key to comprehending phenomena such as light, radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays. From their properties to their applications across different fields, let's delve deeper into the intricate world of electromagnetic waves.  At the core of electromagnetic waves lies their dual nature, exhibiting both wave-like and particle-like characteristics. This duality is encapsulated in James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, which unifies electricity and magnetism. According to Maxwell's equations, a changing electric field induces a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, perpetuating a self-sustaining wave known as an electromagnetic wave. The wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) of electromagnetic waves are inversely proportional, as dictated by the equation c = λf, where c represents the speed of light in a vacuum (~3 x 10^8 m/s).  Electromagnetic waves span a vast spectrum, categorized by their frequencies and wavelengths. This spectrum encompasses radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each segment of the spectrum has unique properties and applications, from communications and medical imaging to heating and sterilization processes. For instance, radio waves are harnessed for wireless communication, while X-rays are employed in medical diagnostics and security scanning due to their ability to penetrate matter to varying extents.  The behavior of electromagnetic waves is governed by several principles that define how they interact with their surroundings. One key characteristic is reflection, where waves bounce off a surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence. This phenomenon underlies mirrors' ability to produce reflections and radar systems' functionality in detecting objects. Refraction occurs when waves change speed and direction upon passing through mediums of different densities, leading to phenomena like the bending of light in water or the dispersion of colors in a prism.  Moreover, electromagnetic waves exhibit diffraction, the bending of waves around obstacles or through narrow openings. Diffraction plays a vital role in sound propagation, radio wave transmission, and even in the functioning of optical devices like cameras and microscopes. Another crucial behavior is interference, where waves superpose to create regions of constructive and destructive interference. This phenomenon is exploited in technologies like antennas, diffraction gratings, and holography to manipulate and control wave patterns.  Polarization is yet another characteristic of electromagnetic waves, referring to the orientation of the electric field component along the wave's propagation direction. By filtering out waves of specific polarizations, applications like 3D glasses and optical instruments can enhance image quality and reduce glare. Additionally, absorption and scattering influence how electromagnetic waves interact with matter, impacting energy transfer, material properties, and atmospheric phenomena like the color of the sky.  The application of electromagnetic waves spans various industries and scientific fields, showcasing their versatility and utility. In telecommunications, radio waves enable wireless communication over long distances, while microwaves power technologies like radar, satellite communication, and microwave ovens. Infrared radiation finds applications in night vision, remote sensing, and thermal imaging, contributing to advancements in security and environmental monitoring.  Visible light, encompassing the colors of the rainbow, is essential for human vision and plays a crucial role in photography, microscopy, and optical communication. Meanwhile, X-rays are indispensable in medical imaging, material analysis, and airport security checks due to their ability to penetrate soft tissues and reveal structural details. Gamma rays, with the highest energy in the spectrum, are utilized in cancer treatments, sterilization processes, and astronomical observations of high-energy phenomena.  In conclusion, electromagnetic waves are a cornerstone of modern physics and technology, shaping the way we perceive the world and driving innovations across industries. Their behavior, encompassing phenomena like reflection, refraction, diffraction, interference, polarization, absorption, and scattering, underpins a wide array of applications that impact our daily lives. From the communication devices we use to the medical technologies that save lives, electromagnetic waves continue to be a fascinating and indispensable aspect of our existence.""","854"
"Crozier A A  Arthur Alger ","""If large plants must be used extra pains should be taken in setting, in order that there may be as little check in their growth as possible. With cauliflowers, as with cabbages, large plants are the easiest to make live, but, for the reason stated, it is less desirable to use them. Setting the plants in shallow trenches, after the manner of celery, is sometimes practised in garden culture. This places the roots where the soil is cool and moist and enables the plants to be watered to good advantage. This method is mainly used in early spring planting, when, besides its convenience in irrigation, it also serves to protect the plants from cold winds. Planting between ridges, as elsewhere described, serves the same purpose of protection. In either case the surface is gradually brought to a level as the plants are cultivated.. In cultivation everything depends on keeping up a steady, vigorous growth, for if the plants are checked in their growth, they are liable either to form small heads prematurely, or to continue their growth so late as to fail to head at all. Level cultivation is usually practiced, the same as in ordinary field crops. Drawing the earth to the stems, as sometimes recommended and practiced abroad, is unnecessary, though with tall growing varieties it serves a useful purpose in preventing the plants being blown over by the wind. Cultivation should continue until the leaves are so large that they are liable to be broken off, or until the plants are nearly ready to head. The application of a mulch of manure or litter at the time cultivation ceases, is an excellent practice, though seldom resorted to. It is important that deep cultivation should cease at the right time, even if the hoe has to be used afterward. The crop may be seriously injured, or at least delayed, by cultivation after the plants begin to head. At this time the ground should be undisturbed so that the roots may occupy the entire soil. Dry weather, and the compact nature of the soil after cultivation ceases, check the growth of the plants, and promote the formation of heads, providing the plants have attained a proper age and size. The influence of a firm soil in promoting heading is also seen in the success with which cauliflowers can frequently be grown after peas or other early crops. In autumn the first sharp frosts appear to be particularly efficacious in starting the plants to heading.. After heading has commenced is the time when irrigation is most needed. An abundance of water at this time will add greatly, both to the quantity and quality of the product, particularly if some fertilizer is added at the same time. Irrigation is not often practiced in this country, except in the arid districts of the West, and occasionally, with the early crop, near a few of our large cities. In Europe, where labor is cheap, it is often resorted to, even where the water has to be carried by hand. Early in the season, if irrigation is needed, once a week is frequent enough to apply the water, but while the plants are heading it may be applied with advantage every day if the weather is dry. THE. The value of cauliflowers for use or market depends almost entirely on their being white and tender. To have them remain in this condition until fully matured, they must be protected from the sun. Heads which are left exposed become yellow in color, or even brownish purple if the sun is very hot. Such heads also acquire a strong, disagreeable flavor. There are various ways of covering the heads, but it is nearly always done with the leaves of the plant. Early in the season, when the weather is dry and warm, the work may be done during the heat of the day by lapping the leaves, one after another, over the head until it is sufficiently covered, tucking the last leaf under to hold all in place. Or the leaves may be fastened with a butcher's skewer, or any sharp stick. In Florida, orange thorns are employed for this purpose. Care must be taken not to confine the heads too closely, or they will grow out of shape, besides being liable to heat and become spotted. Later in the season, when the weather is cool and damp, the leaves will be too stiff to be bent down, and the head must then be protected either by placing over it leaves broken from the outer part of the plant, or from stumps from which the heads have already been cut, or by tying the leaves together above the head. The latter is the usual method, rye straw or bast matting being generally used for the purpose. Merely breaking down the inner leaves upon the head is unsatisfactory, as the growth, both of the leaves and the head, soon causes the head to become exposed. The artificial blanching of the head is most important early in the season, while the sun is hot, and the field should then be gone over as often as every other day for this purpose, taking two rows at a time. Later in the season, during damp, cloudy weather, heads will sometimes reach full size and still be of good color though entirely exposed. It is unsafe to leave them in this way, however, as a little change in color seriously affects their market value. Covering the heads appears also to cause them to grow larger and remain solid longer than they otherwise would, particularly early in the season. FROM. Another object, late in the season, in covering the heads, is to protect them from frost. A frosted cauliflower is practically worthless for market, as it is nearly certain to turn black on the surface after one or two days' exposure. Freezing, in fact, is one of the most frequent sources of loss on cauliflowers late in the season, and as this is the most favorable time of the year for them to head, it is necessary to take particular care to guard against loss from this cause. We frequently have a few hard frosts early in October, which spoil such heads as are nearly mature, unless they have been protected. After this there may be a month or more of good weather, during which the bulk of the crop may come to maturity. The heads are protected from frost in the same manner as from the sun, but it is best not to have the leaves lie directly on the head. Protection is particularly needed as the heads approach maturity, as they are then more easily injured than while small. Heads which are well covered will usually stand eight or ten degrees of frost without injury, depending on the amount of cloudiness and moisture present. In cool, moist, cloudy weather, frosted heads will sometimes recover and show no injury. It is even possible for heads to become frozen solid and come out in good condition, but this rarely occurs, and requires that the thawing take place in the most favorable manner possible. Cutting the frozen heads with their leaves, throwing them in shallow heaps upon the ground, and covering with straw, will sometimes bring them out in good condition; also throwing them into water but little above the freezing point. The safest way, however, if possible, is to cook the heads at once, putting the frozen heads directly into boiling water. Treated in this manner they exhibit little or no effect of the freezing. The safest way, in case heavy freezing is apprehended, is to cut and remove to a place of safety all heads which have attained half their size or more. THE. The frequency of cutting will depend on the season of the year. In summer, the heads will remain at the proper stage for cutting no more than a day or two, while late in autumn they may often be left a week before becoming overgrown. Frequent cutting is at all times desirable, however, as it is best to let the heads get as large as they will before becoming loose and warty. The gain in size not only increases their selling price, but the flavor also appears to improve as the heads approach maturity. Immature heads, though mild and tender, have less flavor than those which are full grown. It is better, however, to cut a head too soon than to leave it too long, for a small solid head will sell for more than a large loose one. To judge when a head has reached full size requires some experience. The size of course, will depend on that of the plant, but its size in proportion to that of the plant is perhaps the most common point by which one judges when it is ready to cut. The head, when it approaches maturity, rises within the leaves and bulges the latter outward, so that one can often tell at some distance which heads are about ready. The surface of the head, as it approaches maturity loses its polished appearance and becomes more distinctly grained. This change, if it does not go too far, does not detract from its appearance and value. To examine a head, do not untie the top, but part the leaves at the side. If there are signs of cracking or breaking it is ready to cut. The heads should be cut with about an inch of stalk and two or three full circles of leaves. A long thin-bladed knife is best to cut with. The best time of the day in which to cut the heads, if for home use, or a near market, is in the morning while the dew is on, as they will then remain longer in a fresh state than if cut latter in the day. If to pack for a distant market, the heads will carry and keep better if cut when dry, but on a cool day or toward evening.. The heads must be handled with care to prevent the 'flower' becoming bruised or soiled in any way. A bruise will turn black in a short time, the same as a frosted surface, and thus injure the sale of the head. The heads can be handled most safely if the leaves are left on, and these had best be left entire until the plants are taken to the packing shed; and for a near market they may even be left on to advantage until the plants are ready to be exposed for sale. The main object of their removal is in order that the heads may be readily inspected..""","""Cauliflower cultivation techniques and care""","2069","""Cauliflower, a member of the brassica family, is a nutritious vegetable known for its versatility and health benefits. Cultivating cauliflower can be a rewarding experience for gardeners, whether you are a beginner or an experienced grower. In this guide, we will explore the techniques and care required for successful cauliflower cultivation.  **Varieties and Climate:** Before starting your cauliflower cultivation journey, it is essential to choose the right variety based on your climate and growing conditions. Cauliflower varieties can be categorized into early, mid, and late-season types. Early varieties mature faster, while late-season types take longer to develop. Select a variety that suits your climate and desired harvest time.  Cauliflower thrives in cool weather conditions, preferring temperatures between 60-75°F (15-24°C). It is crucial to plant cauliflower in a location that receives full sun exposure, as this will ensure proper growth and development.  **Soil Preparation:** Preparing the soil is a critical step in successful cauliflower cultivation. Cauliflower requires well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter. Before planting, amend the soil with compost or aged manure to improve its nutrient content and structure. Ensure the soil pH is between 6.0-7.0, as cauliflower prefers slightly acidic to neutral soil for optimal growth.  **Planting Techniques:** Cauliflower can be grown from seeds or transplants. If starting from seeds, sow them indoors 4-6 weeks before your last frost date. Once the seedlings have developed a few true leaves, they can be transplanted into the garden. When planting, space cauliflower plants 18-24 inches apart in rows that are 24-36 inches apart to allow for proper air circulation and growth.  For transplanting, carefully remove the seedlings from their containers, taking care not to disturb the roots. Plant them at the same depth as they were in the containers and water thoroughly to help them establish in their new environment.  **Watering and Moisture:** Proper watering is essential for cauliflower cultivation, as consistent moisture levels promote optimal growth and head development. Water cauliflower plants regularly, ensuring the soil remains evenly moist but not waterlogged. Mulching around the plants can help retain soil moisture and suppress weed growth.  **Fertilization:** Cauliflower is a heavy feeder and requires regular fertilization to support its growth. Apply a balanced fertilizer high in nitrogen every 3-4 weeks to provide the necessary nutrients for healthy development. Avoid overfertilizing, as this can lead to excessive foliage growth at the expense of head formation.  **Pest and Disease Management:** Cauliflower is susceptible to various pests and diseases that can affect its growth and yield. Common pests include aphids, cabbage worms, and slugs, while diseases such as clubroot and powdery mildew can impact plant health.  To prevent pest infestations, implement cultural practices such as crop rotation, removing debris, and using row covers. Monitor your plants regularly for signs of pests or diseases and take prompt action if any issues arise. Organic pesticides and fungicides can be used as a last resort to control severe infestations.  **Harvesting and Storage:** Knowing when to harvest cauliflower is crucial to ensure the best flavor and quality. Cauliflower heads are ready for harvest when they reach a desirable size and are firm to the touch. Use a sharp knife to cut the head from the plant, leaving a few outer leaves intact for protection.  After harvesting, cauliflower can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. To extend its shelf life, blanch the florets briefly in boiling water and then freeze them for long-term storage.  **Conclusion:** Cauliflower cultivation requires proper planning, attention to detail, and consistent care to achieve successful results. By choosing the right variety, preparing the soil adequately, following planting techniques, and providing adequate water, nutrients, and pest management, you can enjoy a bountiful harvest of homegrown cauliflower. Experiment with different varieties and techniques to find what works best in your garden and enjoy the satisfaction of growing your own delicious and nutritious cauliflower.""","833"
"Green Thomas Hill","""It was the result of his recognition of the rule of Christ in the natural conscience in the elemental reason, in virtue of which man is properly a law to himself. From the same idea followed the principle of universal toleration, the exclusion of the magistrates power alike from the maintenance and restraint of any kind of opinion. This principle did not with Vane and the independents rest, as in modern times, on the slippery foundation of a supposed indifference of all religious beliefs, but on the conviction of the sacredness of the reason, however deluded, in every man, which may be constrained by nothing less divine than itself. The rule of magistracy says Vane, is not to intrude itself into the office and proper concerns of Christs inward government and rule in the conscience, but it is to content itself with the outward man, and to intermeddle with the concerns thereof in reference to the converse which man ought to have with man, upon the grounds of natural justice and right in things appertaining to this life. Nor would he allow the re-establishment under the name of christian discipline, of that constraint of the conscience which he refused to the magistrate. Such discipline, he would hold, as he held the sabbath, to be rather a magistratical institution in imitation of what was ceremonious and temporary among the Jews, than that which hath any clear appointment in the gospel. Christs spirit was not bound. A system of truth and discipline had not been written down once for all in the scriptures, but rather was to be gradually elicited from the scriptures by the gradual manifestation in the believer of the spirit which spoke also in them. A waiting, seeking attitude, unbound by rule whether ecclesiastical or secular, was that which became a spiritual church. The application of this waiting spirit to practical life is to be found in the policy of Cromwell. It would be unfair to ascribe the theory of Vane in its speculative fulness to the independents as a body. It seems, however, to be but the development of the view on which Mr. Robinson had dwelt in his last words to the settlers of New Plymouth; and, so far as it could be represented by a sect, it was represented by the independents. It came before the world, in full outward panoply, in the army of Cromwell. The history of its inevitable conflict with the spirit of presbyterianism on the one hand and the wisdom of the world on the other, of its aberrations and perplexities, of its brief triumph and final flight into the wilderness, is the history of the rise and fall of the English commonwealth. I have yet to speak, however, of the representation of the wisdom of the world in the Long Parliament. Before the outbreak of the war, as I have explained, Vane was the only man in the house of commons whose opinions were recognised as definitely opposed both to episcopacy and presbyterianism. In the lords his only recognised follower was lord Brook, known to the readers of Sir Walter Scott as the fanatic Brook, really an eminent scholar and man of letters, who was shot in storming the close at Lichfield in the first year of the war, leaving as a legacy to the parliament a plea for freedom of speech and conscience. The majority of the parliament, however, had no special love for the presbyterian discipline and theology. Their favour to it was merely negative. They dreaded arminianism, as notoriously at that time the great weapon in the hands of the jesuits; they objected to the high episcopacy as sacerdotal, and as maintaining a jurisdiction incompatible with civil liberty. In 641 a modified episcopacy on Ushers plan was a possible solution of the difficulty. Each shire was to have a presbytery of twelve members, with a bishop as president who, with assistance of some of the presbytery, was to ordain, degrade, and excommunicate. Though the pressure of strife with the king prevented anything being done to carry out this resolution, it probably represented the views even of the more advanced parliamentary leaders; but only, however, as afterwards appeared, on the supposition that the presbyters with their bishop should be strictly under civil control. The worldly wisdom of the Long Parliament was, in the party language of the times, essentially erastian. As the presbyterian claims mounted higher, this became more apparent. The calling of the assembly of divines, and the adoption of the covenant, might seem to give presbyterianism a sufficiently broad charter of privilege; yet both these steps were taken by parliament with restrictions which showed its temper. The ordinance which called the assembly gave it power until further order should be taken by parliament to confer of such matters concerning the liturgy, discipline, and government of the church of England, or the vindicating of the doctrine of the same from false aspersions and misconstructions, as shall be proposed by both or either house of parliament, and no other. It concludes by providing that this ordinance shall not give them, nor shall they in this assembly assume to exercise, any jurisdiction, power, or authority ecclesiastical whatsoever, or any other power than is herein particularly expressed. This document has nothing revolutionary about it. It is the natural utterance of what Brook pronounced to have been an episcopal and erastian parliament of conformists. This parliament, however, had soon under military necessity to raise a spirit which no episcopacy or erastianism could lay. The divines came to Westminster, according to Brook, all conformists, with the exception of eight or nine independents. They came, that is, from the cooling atmosphere of benefices, and had not yet begun to discuss the liturgy or object to a modified episcopacy. If they came conformists, however, they did not long remain so. Contact with each other, and the applause of London congregations, essentially presbyterian in their sympathies, bred a warmer temper. The introduction of the Scotch commissioners, and the adoption of the covenant, gave spirit and strength to their disciplinarian humour, and in a few months, men who had come to the assembly anxious only for some restraint on episcopal tyranny, were clamouring for the establishment of presbyterianism as jure divino. I have spoken of the adoption of the covenant in England as matter of military necessity. It was the condition of alliance between parliament and the Scotch; without this alliance the year 644 would in all probability have been fatal to the parliamentary cause. Supposing the Scotch army to have simply held aloof, the royal party would have been so triumphant in the north as to enable the king to advance with irresistible force on Lichfield. Till the parliament had secured it, however, it could not be trusted to stand aloof; it might at any time have been gained for the king by his consenting, as he did too late in 648, to the covenant. The English negotiators, of whom Vane was the chief, had hoped to secure the alliance by a merely civil league, and when the Scotch insisted on the adoption of the religious covenant, they still succeeded in having the document entitled league and covenant instead of covenant alone. In later years, as we shall see, they always insisted on interpreting it as a league in virtue of which each kingdom was to help the other in the establishment of what religion it chose, not as binding either to any particular form. The desirableness of such interpretation is more obvious than its correctness. By the first and second clauses, as they originally stood, the covenanters bound themselves to the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland, and the reformation of religion in England and Ireland, in doctrine, worship, discipline and government; also to the extirpation of prelacy. After the words reformation etc. Vane procured the insertion of the qualification according to the word of God, in order to avoid committal to any particular form. To ease the conscience of those who favoured Ushers form of episcopacy, prelacy was interpreted to mean church government by archbishops, bishops, their chancellors and commissaries, deans, chapters, archdeacons, and all other ecclesiastical officers depending on that hierarchy. This modified covenant was taken by the parliament and the assembly at Westminster, and enjoined on every one over the age of eighteen. Practically it was by no means universally imposed even on the clergy; in Baxters neighbourhood none took it. Still, its operation was to eject from their livings some two thousand clergymen, whose places were mostly filled by presbyterians. A shifty and exacting alliance was thus dearly purchased at the cost of at once spreading loose over the country an uncontrolled element of disaffection to the parliament, and giving vent to a spirit of ecclesiastical arrogance which would soon demand to rule alone. This spirit was not long in showing itself. The Scotch army entered England at the beginning of 644, and throughout that year the kirk, either by petition or through the commons in England, was pressing for a presbyterian settlement of church government in England. At last the assembly, still under special permission from parliament, was allowed to proceed to the discussion of this question.

The relationship between organized religion and personal beliefs is intricate, often leading to discussions on autonomy, authority, and morality. This essay delves into the dynamics between religious governance and individual conscience, exploring how they intersect, conflict, and influence each other in various contexts.  Religious governance refers to the systems, structures, and rules established by religious institutions to regulate the beliefs, practices, and behaviors of their adherents. These institutions, such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues, provide a framework for religious practice and community organization. In many cases, religious governance is synonymous with spiritual leadership, where clergy members or religious authorities guide and oversee the faithful. These leaders act as intermediaries between believers and their respective doctrines, interpreting scriptures and traditions to provide moral guidance and direction. Religious governance often involves hierarchies, rituals, and codes of conduct that help maintain order and coherence within religious communities.  On the other hand, individual conscience refers to the inner sense of right and wrong that guides an individual's moral decisions and actions. It is the personal awareness of morality and ethics, shaped by one's beliefs, values, experiences, and reasoning. Individual conscience is deeply rooted in the idea of personal autonomy and accountability, reflecting the notion that each person is responsible for their ethical choices and judgments. It plays a crucial role in moral decision-making, prompting individuals to reflect on their actions, consider the consequences, and choose the morally right course of action based on their convictions.  The intersection of religious governance and individual conscience often gives rise to complex ethical dilemmas and philosophical debates. While religious institutions provide moral frameworks and guidelines for their members to follow, individuals may find themselves grappling with conflicting beliefs or values that challenge established norms. This tension between external religious authority and internal moral conviction can create a conflict of conscience, where individuals must navigate between loyalty to their faith community and fidelity to their personal beliefs.  Moreover, the relationship between religious governance and individual conscience is influenced by historical, cultural, and social factors. In some religious traditions, there is a strong emphasis on obedience to religious authorities and adherence to orthodoxy, which can sometimes suppress individual moral agency and critical thinking. In contrast, other traditions may prioritize individual interpretation of religious teachings and encourage autonomy in ethical decision-making. These differences in approach highlight the diversity of perspectives on the balance between religious authority and personal conscience.  The concept of religious governance and individual conscience also intersects with broader discussions on religious freedom, human rights, and social justice. In pluralistic societies, where people of diverse religious backgrounds coexist, the tension between upholding religious principles and respecting individual liberties becomes increasingly relevant. Balancing the rights of religious communities to govern their affairs internally with the rights of individuals to express their beliefs freely is a complex yet essential task for policymakers, legal scholars, and religious leaders.  In conclusion, the dynamic interplay between religious governance and individual conscience reflects the complex nature of human spirituality, ethics, and community life. While religious institutions provide structure, guidance, and a sense of belonging, individual conscience serves as a moral compass that navigates the complexities of ethical decision-making. Navigating the relationship between religious authority and personal beliefs requires a nuanced understanding of tradition, modernity, and individual autonomy. By fostering dialogue, mutual respect, and a deep appreciation for diversity, societies can strive towards a harmonious integration of religious governance and individual conscience that upholds both communal values and individual freedoms.""","698"
"Woodbridge Frederick James Eugene","""Each is furthered or hindered as events fall out. Some careers are cut short, others prosper. Everywhere there is selection. Everywhere there is adaptation of means to ends. The history of the garden can be written because there is a history there to write. Such an illustration can be generalized. Our world is indubitably a world in time. That means much more than the fact that its events can be placed in accordance with a map or dated in accordance with a calendar. It means that they are events in genuine careers, each with its own particular character and its own possibility of a future, like the seeds in the garden. Things with histories have not only structures in space and are, accordingly, related geometrically to one another; they have not only chemical structures and are thus analyzable into component parts; they have also structures in time. They are not now what they will be, but what they will be is always continuous with what they are, so that we must think of them stretched out, so to speak, in time as well as in space, or as being so many moments as well as so much volume. What they become, however, depends not only on their own time structures, but also on their interplay with one another. They are helped and hindered in their development. The results reached at any time are such as complete those which have gone before, for each career is the producer, but not the product of its past. It seems clear, therefore, that there is purpose in history. But 'purpose' is a troublesome word. It connotes design, intention, foresight, as well as the converging of means upon a specific end. Only in the latter sense is it here used, but with this addition: the end is to be conceived not in terms of any goal ultimately reached, but in terms of the career of which it is the termination; and in this career, the present is continually adding to and completing the past. The growing seeds end each in its own specific flower or fruit. They are each of its own kind and named accordingly. It is only because each of them has its specific structure in time that their growth presents that convergence of means toward an end by which we distinguish them and for which we value them. In purpose construed in this way there is evidently no need of design or intention or foresight. In making a garden there is such need. The purposes of nature may be deliberately employed to attain the purposes of men. But apart from beings who foresee and plan there appears to be no evidence of intention in the world. When we speak of nature's designs, we speak figuratively, and impute to her rational and deliberate powers. But we can not clearly affirm that the rain falls in order that the garden may be watered, or that the eye was framed in order that we might see. The evidence for design of that character has been proved inadequate again and again with every careful examination of it. To say, therefore, that nature is full of purpose does not mean that nature has been framed in accordance with some preconceived plan, but rather that nature is discovered to be an historical process, the conversion of the possible into the actual in such a way that there is conserved a progressive record of that conversion. From the selective character of history it follows that a single complete history of anything is impossible--certainly a single complete history of the world at large. History is pluralistic. This conclusion might be reached as others have already been reached by pointing out how it follows from the purpose of writing history, and how this purpose indicates the character of movements in time. Indeed this has already been done in pointing out that the history of England is its many histories and the history of a garden the history of its many seeds. Always there is a particular career and particular incidents appropriate to it. Any career may be as comprehensive as desired, but the more inclusive it is the more restricted it becomes. The history of Milton contains details which the history of English literature will omit; and the history of the cosmos shrinks to nothing when we try to write it. The only universal history is the exposition of what history itself is, the time process stripped of all its variety and specific interests. Consequently, a single purpose is not discoverable; there are many purposes. When we try to reduce them all to some show of singleness we again do no more than try to tell what a temporal order is like. It is metaphysics and not history we are writing. To affirm that history is pluralistic is, however, only to reaffirm the selective character of history generally. A history of the world in order to be single, definite, and coherent, must exhibit a single, definite, and coherent purpose or time process. That means, of course, that it is distinguished from other purposes equally single, definite, and coherent. There are thus many histories of the world distinguished from one another by the incidence of choice or emphasis. The flower in the crannied wall with its history fully recorded and understood would, consequently, illustrate the universe. All that has ever happened might be interpreted in illumination of its career. Yet it would be absurd to maintain that either nature or Tennyson intended that the little flower should be exclusively illustrative. The wall would do as well, or its crannies, or the poet. Nature exhibits no preference either in the choice of a history or in the extent of its comprehensiveness. Man may be thought to be, and man is, an incident in the universe, and the universe may be thought to be, and the universe is, the theater of man's career. The same principle may be illustrated from human history exclusively. We who are of European ancestry and largely Anglo-Saxon by inheritance are pleased to write history as the development of our own civilization with its institutions, customs, and laws; and we regard China and Japan, for example, as incidental and contributory to our own continuation in time. Because our heritage is Christian we date all events from the birth of Christ. Yet we gain some wisdom by pausing to reflect how our procedure might impress an enlightened historian from China or Japan. Would he begin with the cradle of European civilization, pass through Greece and Rome, and then from Europe to America, remarking that in 85/82 A.D. Commodore Perry opened Japan to the world? Surely he would begin otherwise, and not unlike ourselves would construe the history of the world in a manner relevant to the progress of his own civilization. Europe and America and Christianity would contribute to that development, but would not constitute its essential or distinctively significant factors. The historian is himself an historical fact indicating a selection, a distinction, and an emphasis in the course of time. His history is naturally colored by that fact. Other histories he can write only with an effort at detachment from his own career. He must forget himself if he would understand others; but he must understand himself first, if he is successfully to forget what he is. He must know what history is, recognize its pluralistic character, and try to do it justice. To do justice to the pluralistic character of history is not, however, simply to write other histories than one's own with commendable impartiality. It is also to be keenly alive to the philosophical implications of this pluralism. The most significant of them is doubtless this: since philosophically considered history is a thing not written, but evolved and acted, to no one history can absolute superiority or preference be assigned. Absolutely considered the history of man can not claim preeminence over the history of the stars. He is no more the darling of the universe than is the remotest nebula. It is just as intelligible and just as true to say that man exists as an illustration of stellar evolution as to say that the sun exists to divide light from darkness for the good of man. Absolutely considered the cosmos is impartial to its many histories. But even that is not well said, for it implies that the cosmos might be partial if it chose. We should rather say that there is no considering of history absolutely at all. For history is just the denial of absolute considerations. It is the affirmation of relative considerations, of considerations which are relative to a selected career. There is no other kind of history possible. The recognition of this fact does not, however, imply the futility of all history. It does not imply that any history is good enough for men since all histories are good enough for the cosmos. So to conclude is to disregard completely the implications of pluralism. If no history can claim absolute distinction, all histories are distinguished, nevertheless, from one another. If no history can claim preeminence over any other, it is true also that none can be robbed by any other of its own distinction and character. The fact that the morning stars do not sing together is not the universe's estimate of the value of poetry. The fact that the rain falls equally upon the just and the unjust is evidence neither of the impartial dispensations of deity nor of the equal issue of vice and virtue. Each event in its own history and illustrative of its own career is the law. Yet men have been prone to write their own history as if it were something else than a human enterprise, as if it were something else than the history of humanity. Those who seek to read their destiny from the constellations ascendant at their birth are generally called superstitious; but those who seek to read it from the constitution of matter, or from the mechanism of the physical world, or from the composition of chemical substances, although no less superstitious, are too frequently called scientists.""","""History and Pluralism""","1957","""History and Pluralism are intertwined concepts that shape the social fabric of societies worldwide. Pluralism refers to a state where diverse groups coexist, maintaining their unique identities while collectively contributing to a shared vision of society. This dynamic relationship between history and pluralism is evident in the way societies have evolved over time, from ancient civilizations to modern nation-states. By delving into the historical underpinnings of pluralism, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and challenges inherent in fostering inclusivity and diversity within communities.  Looking back at history, we find that pluralistic societies are not a recent phenomenon. Ancient civilizations like the Roman Empire, the Mughal Empire, and the Ottoman Empire were characterized by cultural, religious, and ethnic diversity. These empires encompassed a multitude of communities, each with its own beliefs, traditions, and customs. Despite the presence of dominant cultures, these societies developed mechanisms to accommodate and integrate diverse groups, leading to a rich tapestry of human experiences.  One of the earliest examples of pluralism can be seen in the city-state of Athens during the 5th century BCE. Known as the birthplace of democracy, Athens was home to a diverse population, including citizens, foreigners, and slaves. While citizenship was restricted to native-born males, non-citizens still played significant roles in the city's social and economic life. This inclusive approach, although imperfect by today's standards, laid the foundation for the idea that diverse groups could coexist within a shared community.  The concept of pluralism continued to evolve throughout history, influenced by factors such as conquest, migration, trade, and colonization. The expansion of empires led to the intermingling of cultures and the exchange of ideas, resulting in hybrid societies that blended diverse elements. The Silk Road, for example, facilitated cultural exchanges between East and West, fostering a spirit of cosmopolitanism that transcended traditional boundaries.  However, the history of pluralism is not without its dark chapters. Colonialism, for instance, imposed cultural hegemony on indigenous populations, subjugating them to oppressive systems that suppressed their languages, beliefs, and identities. The legacy of colonialism continues to impact many societies today, highlighting the challenges of reconciling diverse historical narratives within a pluralistic framework.  In the modern era, the ideal of pluralism has gained prominence as societies grapple with increasing cultural diversity and globalization. The 20th century witnessed movements for civil rights, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, and indigenous rights, challenging prevailing notions of homogeneity and advocating for equal representation and recognition of marginalized voices. These struggles have reshaped our understanding of inclusivity and prompted a reevaluation of traditional power structures.  Today, the concept of pluralism extends beyond mere coexistence to encompass principles of equality, tolerance, and mutual respect. In multicultural societies like the United States, Canada, Australia, and many European nations, the promotion of diversity has become a cornerstone of social policy, enshrined in laws and institutions that safeguard the rights of minority groups. Education, media, and the arts play crucial roles in shaping public discourse and promoting intercultural understanding.  Despite these advancements, challenges to pluralism persist in the form of racism, xenophobia, religious intolerance, and political polarization. The rise of populist movements and nationalist sentiments reflects a backlash against pluralistic ideals, fueled by fears of cultural dilution and economic competition. In an increasingly interconnected world, the need for fostering empathy, dialogue, and cooperation across different communities has never been more urgent.  To address these challenges, historical perspective can offer valuable insights into the complexities of pluralism and the ways in which societies have navigated diversity in the past. By studying the experiences of multicultural societies throughout history, we can learn from both their achievements and their failures, shaping more inclusive and equitable futures for all. It is through acknowledging and embracing our shared heritage of pluralism that we can build bridges across divides and forge a more harmonious coexistence.""","793"
"Bernhardi Friedrich von","""For the longer the line of collision, the less effect do such flank attacks exercise; they are only too often mere blows in the air, and lead to waste of energy. 2. Out of every victorious melee one must endeavour, as soon as possible, to rally closed detachments (Section 26). For immediate pursuit only fractions of the available troops will be employed (Section 25/8). This pursuit, however, must be carried out with the utmost energy, and the complete expenditure of the horses' power--if possible, to the total extermination of the enemy. The forces employed must be adequate for the attainment of this end. AND.. The attack must be as concentric as possible, and from different directions, to compel the defender to scatter his fire. The units are always to be employed by 'Wings.'. If possible, the defender must be surprised, and if Artillery, he should be attacked from the flank.. Where a wide zone of fire has to be ridden through, though even against Artillery, successive 'Lines' must be employed, and the less shaken the enemy appears to be the greater the number of such 'Lines' (Section 5/80). Artillery attacked frontally must be compelled by the leading 'Lines' to change both elevation and the nature of their fire.. The result, however, depends less on the Form employed than on the rapid seizure of momentarily favourable circumstances.. Only closed 'Lines' on a broad front can be relied on for success. Where the squadrons each seek independently for an object of attack, they generally miss it altogether, and to assign each individual squadron a special target will mostly be impossible, for the attack will be launched from such a distance that separate objects in the defender's lines will hardly be recognisable. Once within the zone of serious losses it will be obviously impossible to undertake those changes of direction which one sees unhappily so constantly in peace. One rides, in general, straight at a long fire line, and penetrates through as far as one can.. Such frontal attacks require, generally, reserves on both flanks for security against possible disengaging efforts of the enemy's Cavalry.. As the crisis of the engagement approaches, one must close well up on the fighting line, no matter whether one incurs loss or not, in order to be at hand to take advantage of opportunities.. Deployment, changes of direction and of front, are only possible outside the principal fire zone of the enemy.. The distance between following lines varies according to the nature of the enemy's fire. To make these principles familiar to the troops must be one's constant care from the commencement of the regimental drill season onwards. At the same time, the subordinate Leaders must learn to apply them independently, even if no direct order reaches them, or if compelled to act on only the shortest indication of the Superior Commander (Sections 30, 33, 48), and this independence of the subordinate must be the more practised the greater the size of the units (Section 17). To attain this object, as soon as the troops have sufficient mastery of the purely mechanical part of their drill, it will be necessary to append a series of exercises designed both to bring out the essentials of these principles, and, at the same time, to develop the judgment and independence of the junior officers. Such exercises must hence always be based on a well-defined tactical situation, from which it clearly appears whether the Cavalry is 'Independent,' or whether it is acting on the flank or behind the middle of a fighting line; and the corresponding conditions on the enemy's side must also be readily deducible, and on such foundation, under constantly changing assumptions, as to strength and distance of the enemy, all such movements as changes from one tactical formation to another--flank attacks, deployment from column of route or after the passage of defiles--must be practised. In all these exercises the point at issue must be clearly and comprehensively expressed. When one has attained a certain degree of security in the application of these principles, these exercises must be repeated under conditions of ever-increasing difficulty. The order for deployment must be given whilst the troops are in rapid motion. Observation, thought, and command when in full gallop have to be learnt; they do not come naturally. The most various movements, without command or bugle-call, must be executed from a message brought by a galloper. The troops will be practised against a suddenly appearing enemy on simple warnings such as 'Against Cavalry,' 'Against Infantry,' or merely on the sound 'Alert,' and pains must always be taken to see that the fundamentally right formation is adopted. In these exercises it must be left to the initiative of the subordinates to judge the situation for themselves, and always move to their proper place in the prescribed formation by the shortest path. Of course, in such movements the first principle is that the troops nearest the enemy furnish the first 'Line'; the remainder fall into their places as flank coverers, supporting squadrons or reserve. If, in this manner, we succeed in imparting to the junior Leaders thorough clearness as to the principles of the game, and to make them both quick and skilful in their appreciation of the situation, then the work of education on the drill ground is complete, and the troops are ready for exercises over country. No pains must be spared to separate the purely formal and ceremonial side of drill from the practical field-training. The former keeps always, as I have indicated in the first section, its full value for the creation of discipline and alertness, but leads only too easily to a routine which has nothing in common with the battle-field, and to that poverty-stricken 'schematisimus' to which human nature so readily inclines. To the formal school of training, which I have hitherto only had in mind, a whole series of exercises must now be coupled, having for their purpose the application of the acquired forms and principles under all circumstances of the ground. But before we proceed to their detail consideration, we must answer the question how far the drill ground only suffices for the purpose of training. Generally, one can subscribe to General von Schlichting's principle--that forms and principles must be learnt in the drill book, but their application in action only in the open country. Tactical exercises on the drill ground, which have not for sole purposes to bring to expression certain formal principles, are always an evil, and mislead the troops. On the other hand, the principles of the tactical employment of Cavalry are particularly suited to representation on the drill ground because they are frequently of a purely formal nature. Keeping firmly to these established principles, then, to define the limits of usefulness of the drill ground, we have only to answer the question within what tactical units this formal drilling is still instructive or possible. My opinion is that the Brigade marks the highest limit, as within it all tactical principles find their application, and it is the largest body which can still in any way be handled by drill methods only. In the Division, and still more in the higher units, the strategical element preponderates so greatly that anything approaching real drill is out of the question, and all movements which they can execute are based on a complete command of these principles already. Of course, it is not intended to prohibit altogether the formal working together of these masses at the beginning in order to secure complete control and knowledge of them for further instruction; but one must not delay over these formal movements a moment longer than absolutely necessary, since the real centre of gravity lies in the practical training, and no doubt must be allowed to exist as to which exercises are intended as purely drill and which as practical preparation for War. Nor would I have it implied that brigade and regimental training should be entirely confined to the drill ground. On the contrary, the exercises over country are absolutely essential for practical training, and form the keystone of the whole edifice; but it seems to me not merely permissible but desirable that a portion of these exercises should be carried out on the drill ground in order to expedite this portion of the work. But all the more energetically must it be insisted on that the remainder of the programme--the greater part in regard to time--should be executed, as far as possible, in variable ground, and that all exercises of the larger formations should be confined to such ground as we shall have to work over in War; not alone are they by far the most important for the higher tactical education of the Arm, but they cannot be represented on drill grounds at all; their whole essence is too entirely out of harmony with the conditions of a level plain. That the degree of cultivation existing in the vicinity of the garrisons may interfere seriously with these demands is obvious, and in the absence of the necessary spaces to work over we must fall back on the great training grounds (Truppenubungs Platze); even the possibilities of these are very soon exhausted. But this, at least, is certain: that it is better to hold these exercises on these training grounds than to confine them exclusively to the drill field.""","""Tactical principles of cavalry warfare""","1851","""Cavalry warfare has a long and storied history, playing a crucial role in numerous battles and campaigns throughout the centuries. The principles of cavalry tactics have evolved over time, influenced by changes in technology, strategy, and battlefield conditions. Understanding the tactical principles of cavalry warfare is essential for military historians, enthusiasts, and strategists alike.  One fundamental principle of cavalry warfare is mobility. Cavalry units are known for their speed, agility, and flexibility on the battlefield. They can quickly move across terrain, exploit gaps in enemy lines, and launch surprise attacks. The ability to rapidly deploy forces to critical areas gives cavalry units a strategic advantage, allowing them to outmaneuver and outflank enemy forces. Mobility is a key factor in cavalry tactics and is often used to disrupt enemy formations and create chaos on the battlefield.  Another important principle of cavalry warfare is shock action. Traditional cavalry units were equipped with swords, lances, and other melee weapons designed to deliver devastating blows to enemy forces. The impact of a charging cavalry unit could break enemy lines, shatter morale, and create panic among opposing troops. Shock action was a hallmark of cavalry tactics throughout history, with cavalry charges often deciding the outcome of battles.  Firepower is another crucial element of cavalry warfare. As firearms became more prevalent on the battlefield, cavalry units adapted their tactics to incorporate ranged weapons such as pistols, carbines, and later, rifles. Cavalry units could engage enemy forces from a distance, providing supporting fire for infantry units or harassing retreating enemies. The combination of mobility, shock action, and firepower allowed cavalry units to engage enemies at multiple levels and in various situations.  Coordination with other arms is essential in cavalry warfare. Cavalry units often work in conjunction with infantry, artillery, and other military branches to achieve strategic objectives. Cooperation between different arms is critical for success on the battlefield, with each branch leveraging its strengths to support the overall mission. Cavalry units may be tasked with reconnaissance, screening, pursuit, or exploitation operations, working closely with other units to achieve success.  Terrain analysis is a key consideration in cavalry warfare. Cavalry units must assess the terrain to determine the best approach for conducting operations. Factors such as visibility, cover, obstacles, and avenues of approach influence how cavalry units maneuver on the battlefield. Understanding the terrain allows cavalry commanders to exploit advantages, minimize vulnerabilities, and conduct effective operations against enemy forces.  Command and control are critical aspects of cavalry tactics. Effective communication, leadership, and decision-making are essential for coordinating cavalry units during combat operations. Cavalry commanders must be able to assess the situation, make rapid decisions, and adapt to changing circumstances on the battlefield. Strong command and control structures are necessary to ensure that cavalry units operate cohesively and effectively under pressure.  Logistics and sustainability are vital considerations in cavalry warfare. Cavalry units require adequate supplies of food, water, ammunition, and equipment to sustain operations in the field. Logistics support is essential for keeping cavalry units mobile, supplied, and combat-ready. Proper planning, supply lines, and maintenance are crucial for ensuring the longevity and effectiveness of cavalry units during extended campaigns.  In conclusion, the tactical principles of cavalry warfare encompass mobility, shock action, firepower, coordination with other arms, terrain analysis, command and control, logistics, and sustainability. These principles have guided cavalry units throughout history, shaping the way they engage enemies, achieve objectives, and contribute to the overall success of military operations. By understanding and applying these principles, military planners, historians, and enthusiasts can gain insight into the enduring significance of cavalry tactics in warfare.""","715"
"Snow Alpheus Henry","""There are, it is to be believed, many who will be ready and willing to accept as true the statement, which every student of political history must admit to be true, that the philosophy of the American Revolution was a religious philosophy. It is indeed perhaps not too much to say that the period of the American Revolution was the period in which both political and religious thinking reached the highest point, and that there is no question of government which has since arisen which was not either solved by the Revolutionary statesmen or put in the process of solution. The political philosophy of the American Revolution has long been confused with that of the French Revolution. As matter of fact, they stand at opposite poles. Our philosophy was religious, the French non-religious. America had been peacefully assimilating, for a century and a half, the doctrines of the Reformation. France had been held for two centuries and a half in a condition of mediaevalism, and the principles of the Reformation had little hold among the people. When the Americans spoke, it was with the calm wisdom of free-men; when the French spoke, it was with the folly and excess of intellectual and spiritual slaves who had suddenly emancipated themselves. To the Americans, to whom government was the expression of the just public sentiment, government, equally with religion, was a necessary good; to the French, to whom government was the expression of the will of the majority, whether just or unjust, government was a necessary evil and religion an unnecessary evil. The French Revolution made itself felt, even in America, for a century. Till within recent years, its principles have obscured, though they have never wholly eclipsed, the principles of the American Revolution. But now there seems reason to believe that the French Revolution has spent its force, and that the influence of the American Revolution is growing daily stronger. Signs of this are the councils and conferences which are steadily increasing in number and in power, on the subject of arbitration as the peaceful means of settling questions growing out of the relations of communities, of states and of nations. Arbitration, whether between persons or between communities, states and nations, implies a universal and common law. Peace conferences can, it would seem, have no reasonable purpose and can hope to accomplish no permanent result, except as they attempt to substitute a universal and common law, supported by the public sentiment of the civilized world, for human edicts founded on human will and supported by physical force. The American System is but the establishment of interstate and international arbitration as the common and usual course of governmental action instead of as a voluntary or spasmodic manifestation of governmental will. Only on the assumption of the existence of this universal common law can the relations between us and our Insular brethren be relations under law, for a written constitution between us and them is impossible. We realize, as Americans, that somehow these relations must be under law if they are to be according to the American System, for we know that there is no liberty except under law, and that the American System has, for its sole object, human liberty. If we are right, the American people, in rejecting, as they have, the European terms 'colony,' 'dependence' and 'empire,' and the theory which these terms symbolize, have been true to the American System. In substituting for these terms the American terms, 'free state,' 'just connection' and 'union' and the American theory which these terms symbolize, it is not necessary for us to alter in the least our established views concerning the Constitution as the supreme law of the Union. It is only necessary for us to realize that the Constitution is itself but one application of the great principles of the American System which, as the Supreme Court says, are 'formulated' in it, and to proceed, by a new formulation or by adjudication, to apply these principles outside the present Union wherever American jurisdiction extends, in the confident belief that they can be applied universally, and that, wherever applied, they will bring the blessings of true liberty. THE THE OF THE 'When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation--' 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.'

If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at anytime resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel. 'Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?""","""American Revolution and Religious Philosophy""","1869","""The American Revolution was a pivotal moment in history that not only shaped the political landscape of a nation but also had a profound impact on philosophical and religious thought. The seeds of revolution were sown in a time when Enlightenment ideas were spreading across the Western world, challenging traditional beliefs and institutions. This period of intellectual ferment played a significant role in the shaping of the religious philosophy that underpinned the revolutionary movement in America.  One of the central themes that emerged during the American Revolution was the concept of religious freedom and the separation of church and state. The Founding Fathers, influenced by Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke and Voltaire, believed that individuals should have the right to practice their own religion without interference from the government. This principle was enshrined in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits the establishment of a state religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion.  Religious diversity was a hallmark of American society during the revolution, with different denominations coexisting and contributing to the revolutionary cause. Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and others all played a role in the fight for independence, united by a common desire for liberty and self-determination. This diversity of religious belief helped to shape a philosophical framework that emphasized the importance of tolerance and pluralism in the new nation.  The revolutionary period also saw the rise of new religious movements and the reinvigoration of existing ones. The Great Awakening, a religious revival that swept across the American colonies in the 18th century, had a lasting impact on the religious landscape of the new nation. Preachers like George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards emphasized personal piety and individual salvation, inspiring a sense of spiritual fervor and moral regeneration among the populace.  The relationship between religion and politics was a complex and contentious issue during the American Revolution. While many of the Founding Fathers were deeply religious men who believed in the importance of moral virtue and divine providence, they also recognized the dangers of mixing religion and government. Thomas Jefferson, a key figure in the revolution, famously advocated for a """"wall of separation"""" between church and state to protect the freedom of conscience and prevent the tyranny of religious authority.  The ideas and values that emerged during the American Revolution continue to shape debates about religion and society in the United States today. The tension between individual liberty and communal values, between religious tradition and secular governance, remains a central theme in American political and philosophical discourse. The legacy of the revolution is a vibrant and diverse religious landscape that reflects the pluralistic ideals of the nation’s founding.  In conclusion, the American Revolution was not only a struggle for political independence but also a moment of profound philosophical and religious transformation. The revolutionaries who fought for liberty and equality were inspired by a vision of a society where individuals could worship freely and live according to their own beliefs. The legacy of the revolution lives on in the constitutional protections for religious freedom and the ongoing debates about the role of religion in public life. The American Revolution was not just a political event—it was a philosophical and spiritual awakening that continues to shape the values and ideals of the nation to this day.""","618"
"Berdoe Edward","""He traced our ancestry through the fish, amphibian, marsupial, and ape species; a theory which, despite the original opposition it excited, is now generally accepted. He is best known in connection with medical science by his famous work, On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection, 85/89, his Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, 871, and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, 872. At first his theory of the Descent of Man was held to teach that A very tall pig with a very long nose Puts forth a proboscis quite down to his toes, And then by the name of an elephant goes. Darwin recognised not merely a God but a Creator. AND. SIR OWEN, M.D., F.R.S., etc. (804-892), the celebrated comparative anatomist and palontologist, made it possible for us to see what the extinct monsters were when he enabled us to construct scientifically the models of the megatherium, plesiosaurus, and other animals of remote ages. It has been well said of him that the most characteristic of his faculties was a powerful scientific imagination. Fragments of bone which might be meaningless to less alert observers enabled him to divine the structure and to present the images of whole groups of extinct animal forms. At the suggestion of Dr. was invited in 828 to prepare the catalogue of the Hunterian collection in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, of which Mr. conservator. This great work largely occupied some of the best years of Owens life, the three quarto volumes on the Fossil Vertebrates and Cephalopods of the collection not appearing till 85/85/8. Meanwhile he had given to the world his Odontography, his Lectures on Comparative Anatomy and Physiology (which won a continental reputation), and his famous work on the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton. In 849 he issued an important memoir On Parthenogenesis. In 85/86 Owen was appointed Superintendent of the Department of Natural History in the British Museum, which, through his untiring exertions, was at last to be suitably housed at South Kensington. In 861 he published his manual of Paleontology; from 865/8 to 877 a succession of works on British Fossil Reptiles and the Fossil Reptiles of South Africa. F. G. (809-885/8) so early as 840 advocated the germ theory of disease. It was first suggested, however, by Latours discovery of the yeast plant in 836. ST., M.D., F.R.S. (born 827), the distinguished anatomist and zoologist, is to a certain extent the opponent of Darwin, as he denies that the doctrine of Evolution is applicable to the human intellect. He is the author of many works on anatomy, biology, and zoology., F.R.S., M.D. (born 825/8), the famous physiologist and comparative anatomist and biologist, is a well-known writer on natural science, and the most prominent of the scientific opponents of revealed religion. DR. (born 822), the eminent naturalist, published his Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection in 870, and in 878, in his volume Tropical Nature, still further contributes to our knowledge of sexual selection, etc. (born 834), a celebrated German naturalist and writer on science, is the chief supporter in Germany of Darwins theories. It may be remembered in this connection that these were anticipated to some extent by Goethe (749-832). (born 820) has devoted his life mainly to the working out of his System of Synthetic Philosophy, which proposed to carry out in its application to all orders of phenomena the general law of evolution. J., F.R.S. (born 848), an ardent member of the Darwinian school, is a distinguished physiologist and biologist. AND. (722-809), a physician of Vienna, was the inventor of the method of detecting diseases of the chest by percussion. By striking the chest directly with the tips of the diagnosed by the sound evoked the condition of the organs of the thorax. His system was at first received with contempt and ridicule by his profession; but in 808, Corvisart translated Auenbruggers great work, the Inventum Novum, into French, and the method quickly achieved an European reputation. RENE T. H. LAENNEC (781-826), the celebrated French pathologist, was the inventor of the stethoscope. His great discovery was purely accidental a fact which he declares in his famous work. In 816 I was consulted by a young woman labouring under general symptoms of diseased heart, and in whose case percussion and the application of the hand were of little avail on account of the great degree of fatness. I happened to recollect a simple and well-known fact in acoustics, and fancied it might be turned to some use on the present occasion. The fact I allude to is the great distinctness with which we hear the scratch of a pin at one end of a piece of wood, on applying our ear to the other. Immediately, on this suggestion, I rolled a quire of paper into a kind of cylinder, and applied one end of it to the region of the heart and the other to my ear, and was not a little surprised and pleased to find that I could thereby perceive the action of the heart in a manner much more clear and distinct than I had ever been able to do by the immediate application of the ear. JEAN N. (75/85/8-821) introduced into France Auenbruggers method of percussion, one of the most important aids to physical diagnosis. L. (774-816) made those important researches on tubercle and the changes in the lungs and other organs in consumption which form the basis of our present knowledge of the subject. From this time French physicians introduced great precision in their study of symptoms, so as to invest them with a really scientific character. Combined with the perfected methods of anatomical observation, a new era in clinical medicine dates from this period. (787-872) made important researches on pulmonary consumption and typhoid fever, and introduced the numerical or statistical method in medical science, which was an important step towards making it an exact science. the effects and properties of Calabar bean, and was the most famous of all English investigators of poisons and poisoning. JOHN (777-836), in conjunction with (804-878), a great clinical teacher and author of works on diseases of the chest and heart, discovered the form of breathing in certain disordered conditions which is called Cheyne-Stokes respiration. J. (797-85/83), a great observer and clinical teacher, gave his name to a disease. SIR, M.D. (born 815/8), was the first to establish beyond dispute the difference between typhus and typhoid fevers. JOHN, M.D. (812-875/8), was the first to introduce the use of cod-liver oil in consumption into English practice (841). He claimed also to have discovered leucocythemia before Virchow., M.D. (806-880), was the founder of forensic medicine in England, and his great work on Medical long been the standard authority in medico-legal cases. (797-866) discovered the disease which goes by his name., M.D. (830-879), is celebrated for his researches in epidemic diseases. the author of the ever-popular lectures, The Practice of Physic, a work whose graces of style and elegance of phraseology entitle it to be considered a medical classic. (761-823) was a famous pathologist. He devoted special attention to the pathology of the brain, heart, lungs, stomach, and intestines. It was he who first described the grey miliary tubercle of consumption. In all his profound researches he never failed to remember their practical end in the cure of disease. celebrated for his researches on diseases of the brain and spinal cord. (789-85/88), the reformer of renal pathology, was the discoverer of the disease which bears his name. (793-860) discovered the disease of the suprarenal bodies which is called after him. KARL V. (804-878), one of the most famous of the founders of the New Vienna School, was so indefatigable a pathologist that he is said to have celebrated his thirty-thousandth post-mortem in 866. His great work, The Handbook of Pathological Anatomy, was published in 841. (805/8-881), a physician of the New Vienna School, improved physical diagnosis by his application of the laws of sound. He rendered percussion more perfect by correctly explaining the import of the various sounds heard on striking the chest. He threw great light upon our knowledge of the phenomena of heart diseases. (816-880) created a revolution in the science of skin diseases by basing it upon pathological anatomy. (815/8-877) introduced the use of the clinical thermometer as an important aid to diagnosis, and claimed that pathology is the physiology of sick men. (born 821), the constructor of the cellular pathology, is a celebrated German pathologist and anthropologist.""","""Evolution and Medical Science""","1935","""Evolution and Medical Science have a complex and intertwined relationship that has profoundly shaped our understanding of health and disease. The principles of evolution provide a framework for comprehending how organisms, including humans, have adapted and continue to adapt to their environments over time. In the context of medical science, an understanding of evolution is crucial for addressing various health challenges, such as antibiotic resistance, infectious diseases, and even the emergence of new viruses like COVID-19.  Evolutionary theory posits that all living organisms, including pathogens, undergo genetic changes over generations in response to selective pressures. These changes can result in variations that may confer a survival advantage or disadvantage. In the case of bacteria, for example, the misuse and overuse of antibiotics have led to the selection of resistant strains through the process of natural selection. This phenomenon has serious implications for public health as these resistant bacteria can render once-effective treatments ineffective, leading to prolonged illnesses and increased healthcare costs.  Understanding the evolutionary basis of antibiotic resistance is essential for devising strategies to combat this global health threat. Evolutionary biologists and medical researchers work together to develop new antibiotics, explore alternative treatment options, and implement stewardship programs to promote responsible antibiotic use. By recognizing the dynamics of bacterial evolution, healthcare professionals can better manage infections and preserve the effectiveness of existing drugs.  Evolution also plays a significant role in the spread and virulence of infectious diseases. Pathogens evolve to evade host immunity, overcome barriers to transmission, and adapt to new environments. The study of viral evolution, for instance, is crucial in tracking the mutations of viruses like influenza or HIV to design effective vaccines and antiviral therapies. By monitoring the genetic changes in pathogens, researchers can anticipate the emergence of new strains and develop targeted interventions to mitigate their impact on human health.  Moreover, the evolutionary perspective has reshaped our understanding of human health and disease susceptibility. Evolutionary medicine seeks to explain why certain diseases are more prevalent in specific populations and how our evolutionary history influences our susceptibility to illness. For example, the genetic diversity that underlies different responses to infections or medications can be traced back to our ancestors' evolutionary past. By integrating evolutionary principles into medical research, clinicians can tailor treatments to individual patients based on their genetic predispositions and evolutionary history.  Evolutionary insights also offer explanations for the genetic basis of complex diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders. By studying the genetic variations that have persisted in human populations, scientists can unravel the underlying mechanisms of disease predisposition and develop personalized medicine approaches that take into account individual genetic profiles. This knowledge enables healthcare providers to offer more precise diagnoses, prognoses, and treatments tailored to each patient's unique genetic makeup.  Furthermore, the field of evolutionary psychology sheds light on how our evolutionary past has shaped our behavior, cognition, and mental health. Evolutionary psychologists investigate how our ancestral environments have influenced our psychological traits, social relationships, and adaptive strategies. By understanding the evolutionary origins of mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and addiction, therapists can develop more effective interventions that consider the evolutionary underpinnings of these disorders.  In addition to its applications in healthcare, evolution has practical implications for public health policy, conservation biology, and environmental health. The One Health approach, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, draws on evolutionary principles to address emerging infectious diseases, zoonotic transmissions, and ecosystem disruptions. By considering the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens, vectors, and hosts, public health officials can implement strategies to prevent disease outbreaks, preserve biodiversity, and safeguard ecosystem resilience.  In conclusion, the integration of evolution and medical science has revolutionized our understanding of health and disease from a holistic and interdisciplinary perspective. By viewing health challenges through the lens of evolutionary theory, researchers, clinicians, and policymakers can develop innovative solutions to combat antibiotic resistance, prevent infectious diseases, and improve patient outcomes. Evolutionary insights not only inform medical practice but also underscore the importance of adaptation, variability, and interconnectedness in maintaining healthy populations and ecosystems. As we continue to unravel the intricate relationship between evolution and medicine, we pave the way for a more informed, personalized, and sustainable approach to healthcare that is rooted in our shared evolutionary history.""","835"
"Warner Charles Dudley","""This latest collection of his papers, dealing with a wide range of subjects from the 'Education of the Negro' to 'Literature and the Stage,' with characteristic comments on 'Truthfulness' and 'The Pursuit of Happiness,' shows him at the end of his long and tireless career as a writer still deeply interested in contemporary events, responsive to the appeal of the questions of the hour, and sensitive to all things which affected the dignity and authority of literature. In his interests, his bearing, his relations to the public life of the country, no less than in his work, he held fast to the best traditions of literature, and he has taken his place among the representative American men of Letters. W.. IN If you examine a collection of prints of costumes of different generations, you are commonly amused by the ludicrous appearance of most of them, especially of those that are not familiar to you in your own decade. They are not only inappropriate and inconvenient to your eye, but they offend your taste. You cannot believe that they were ever thought beautiful and becoming. If your memory does not fail you, however, and you retain a little honesty of mind, you can recall the fact that a costume which seems to you ridiculous today had your warm approval ten years ago. You wonder, indeed, how you could ever have tolerated a costume which has not one graceful line, and has no more relation to the human figure than Mambrino's helmet had to a crown of glory. You cannot imagine how you ever approved the vast balloon skirt that gave your sweetheart the appearance of the great bell of Moscow, or that you yourself could have been complacent in a coat the tails of which reached your heels, and the buttons of which, a rudimentary survival, were between your shoulder-blades--you who are now devoted to a female figure that resembles an old-fashioned churn surmounted by an isosceles triangle. These vagaries of taste, which disfigure or destroy correct proportions or hide deformities, are nowhere more evident than in the illustrations of works of fiction. The artist who collaborates with the contemporary novelist has a hard fate. If he is faithful to the fashions of the day, he earns the repute of artistic depravity in the eyes of the next generation. The novel may become a classic, because it represents human nature, or even the whimsicalities of a period; but the illustrations of the artist only provoke a smile, because he has represented merely the unessential and the fleeting. The interest in his work is archaeological, not artistic. The genius of the great portrait-painter may to some extent overcome the disadvantages of contemporary costume, but if the costume of his period is hideous and lacks the essential lines of beauty, his work is liable to need the apology of quaintness. The Greek artist and the Mediaeval painter, when the costumes were really picturesque and made us forget the lack of simplicity in a noble sumptuousness, had never this posthumous difficulty to contend with. In the examination of costumes of different races and different ages, we are also struck by the fact that with primitive or isolated peoples costumes vary little from age to age, and fashion and the fashions are unrecognized, and a habit of dress which is dictated by climate, or has been proved to be comfortable, is adhered to from one generation to another; while nations that we call highly civilized, meaning commonly not only Occidental peoples, but peoples called progressive, are subject to the most frequent and violent changes of fashions, not in generations only, but in decades and years of a generation, as if the mass had no mind or taste of its own, but submitted to the irresponsible ukase of tailors and modistes, who are in alliance with enterprising manufacturers of novelties. In this higher civilization a costume which is artistic and becoming has no more chance of permanence than one which is ugly and inconvenient. It might be inferred that this higher civilization produces no better taste and discrimination, no more independent judgment, in dress than it does in literature. The vagaries in dress of the Western nations for a thousand years past, to go back no further, are certainly highly amusing, and would be humiliating to people who regarded taste and art as essentials of civilization. But when we speak of civilization, we cannot but notice that some of the great civilizations; the longest permanent and most notable for highest achievement in learning, science, art, or in the graces or comforts of life, the Egyptian, the Saracenic, the Chinese, were subject to no such vagaries in costume, but adhered to that which taste, climate, experience had determined to be the most useful and appropriate. And it is a singular comment upon our modern conceit that we make our own vagaries and changeableness, and not any fixed principles of art or of utility, the criterion of judgment, on other races and other times. The more important result of the study of past fashions, in engravings and paintings, remains to be spoken of. It is that in all the illustrations, from the simplicity of Athens, through the artificiality of Louis XIV and the monstrosities of Elizabeth, down to the undescribed modistic inventions of the first McKinley, there is discoverable a radical and primitive law of beauty. We acknowledge it among the Greeks, we encounter it in one age and another. I mean a style of dress that is artistic as well as picturesque, that satisfies our love of beauty, that accords with the grace of the perfect human figure, and that gives as perfect satisfaction to the cultivated taste as a drawing by Raphael. While all the other illustrations of the human ingenuity in making the human race appear fantastic or ridiculous amuse us or offend our taste, --except the tailor fashion-plates of the week that is now,--these few exceptions, classic or modern, give us permanent delight, and are recognized as following the eternal law of beauty and utility. And we know, notwithstanding the temporary triumph of bad taste and the public lack of any taste, that there is a standard, artistic and imperishable. The student of manners might find an interesting field in noting how, in our Occidental civilizations, fluctuations of opinions, of morals, and of literary style have been accompanied by more or less significant exhibitions of costumes. He will note in the Precieux of France and the Euphuist of England a corresponding effeminacy in dress; in the frank paganism of the French Revolution the affectation of Greek and Roman apparel, passing into the Directoire style in the Citizen and the Citizeness; in the Calvinistic cut of the Puritan of Geneva and of New England the grim severity of their theology and morals. These examples are interesting as showing an inclination to express an inner condition by the outward apparel, as the Quakers indicate an inward peace by an external drabness, and the American Indian a bellicose disposition by red and yellow paint; just as we express by red stripes our desire to kill men with artillery, or by yellow stripes to kill them with cavalry. It is not possible to say whether these external displays are relics of barbarism or are enduring necessities of human nature. The fickleness of men in costume in a manner burlesques their shifty and uncertain taste in literature. A book or a certain fashion in letters will have a run like a garment, and, like that, will pass away before it waxes old. It seems incredible, as we look back over the literary history of the past three centuries only, what prevailing styles and moods of expression, affectations, and prettinesses, each in turn, have pleased reasonably cultivated people. What tedious and vapid things they read and liked to read! Think of the French, who had once had a Villon, intoxicating themselves with somnolent draughts of Richardson. But, then, the French could match the paste euphuisms of Lyly with the novels of Scudery. Every modern literature has been subject to these epidemics and diseases. It is needless to dwell upon them in detail. Since the great diffusion of printing, these literary crazes have been more frequent and of shorter duration. We need go back no further than a generation to find abundant examples of eccentricities of style and expression, of crazes over some author or some book, as unaccountable on principles of art as many of the fashions in social life.--The more violent the attack, the sooner it is over. Readers of middle age can recall the furor over Tupper, the extravagant expectations as to the brilliant essayist Gilfillan, the soon-extinguished hopes of the poet Alexander Smith. For the moment the world waited in the belief of the rising of new stars, and as suddenly realized that it had been deceived. Sometimes we like ruggedness, and again we like things made easy. Within a few years a distinguished Scotch clergyman made a fortune by diluting a paragraph written by Saint Paul. It is in our memory how at one time all the boys tried to write like Macaulay, and then like Carlyle, and then like Ruskin, and we have lived to see the day when all the girls would like to write like Heine. In less than twenty years we have seen wonderful changes in public taste and in the efforts of writers to meet it or to create it. We saw the everlastingly revived conflict between realism and romanticism. We saw the realist run into the naturalist, the naturalist into the animalist, the psychologist into the sexualist, and the sudden reaction to romance, in the form of what is called the historic novel, the receipt for which can be prescribed by any competent pharmacist.""","""Literary styles and cultural fashions""","1978","""Literary styles and cultural fashions intertwine to create a rich tapestry of human expression, reflecting the societal values, beliefs, and norms of a particular era. From the Romanticism of the 19th century to the Modernism of the early 20th century, and the Postmodernism that followed, literary styles have evolved in parallel with the shifting cultural landscapes. Similarly, fashion, as a form of visual storytelling, has mirrored and influenced the prevailing cultural attitudes and artistic movements throughout history.  Literary styles are the distinctive ways in which writers use language to convey their ideas and emotions. These styles can encompass a wide range of elements, including narrative structure, tone, word choice, and sentence structure. For instance, the Romantic movement prioritized emotions, nature, and individualism, leading to works marked by vivid imagery and heightened sensibility. In contrast, Modernism focused on alienation, fragmentation, and experimentation with form and language, resulting in works that challenged traditional storytelling conventions.  With the rise of Postmodernism in the mid-20th century, there was a rejection of grand narratives and a blurring of boundaries between high and low culture. Postmodernist literature often features metafiction, pastiche, and irony, reflecting a fragmented and disillusioned worldview. Writers like Italo Calvino, Salman Rushdie, and Thomas Pynchon embraced this style, creating works that playfully deconstructed traditional storytelling norms and engaged with issues of identity, reality, and representation.  In the realm of fashion, cultural fashions serve as visual manifestations of the zeitgeist, capturing the spirit of a particular era. Just as literary styles respond to and shape cultural movements, fashion trends are influenced by societal changes, technological advancements, and artistic innovations. Throughout history, fashion has been used as a form of self-expression, cultural commentary, and identity construction.  For example, the Roaring Twenties saw the emergence of flapper fashion, characterized by loose silhouettes, shorter hemlines, and ornate embellishments, reflecting the rebellious and liberated spirit of the Jazz Age. In contrast, the austerity of the Great Depression and World War II gave rise to utilitarian styles marked by rationing and practicality. The post-war period witnessed a resurgence of femininity with the New Look introduced by Christian Dior, featuring nipped-in waists and full skirts that symbolized optimism and prosperity.  As society entered the tumultuous 1960s and 1970s, fashion and literature became platforms for challenging traditional norms and advocating for social change. The countercultural movements of the era inspired bold and eclectic fashion choices, such as psychedelic patterns, bell-bottom pants, and platform shoes, reflecting a rejection of mainstream conventions. Concurrently, authors like Jack Kerouac, Sylvia Plath, and Toni Morrison pushed the boundaries of literary expression, addressing issues of race, gender, and identity in their works.  In the contemporary landscape, digital advancements and globalization have led to a diversification of literary styles and fashion influences. Writers now have access to a multitude of platforms for publishing and engaging with audiences, leading to experimentation with hybrid forms and interactive storytelling. Likewise, the fashion industry has become more inclusive and sustainable, with designers incorporating diverse perspectives and ethical practices into their creations.  In conclusion, literary styles and cultural fashions are dynamic and interconnected forms of expression that reflect the ever-evolving human experience. By examining the evolution of both disciplines, we gain insight into the values, ideologies, and aesthetics of different time periods. As we continue to navigate the complexities of the modern world, literature and fashion remain powerful tools for exploring our identities, challenging societal norms, and shaping the collective imagination.""","739"
"Kisch Guido","""Two motives, above all, caused the issuance of war prisoner medals: the raising of funds for the support of prisoners of war or the amelioration of their condition; and the creation of the commemorative tokens or medals for presentation to captives after their liberation. It is doubtful and highly improbable, that the mass production of such medals ever reached in quantity a volume equal to that of war prisoners money. The number issued may well run into hundreds, at most a few thousands, but certainly not many thousands. For, to the best of this authors knowledge, no commemorative war medal in the form of an official decoration to be given to all war prisoners in general was issued by any of the states participating in the First World War. Nor did any of the European states that remained neutral and held members of the belligerents in internment camps, issue commemorative medals for internees. This suggestion may well deserve the attention of the United Nations military authorities. After the present war a special commemorative medal of honor should be issued, intended for those who had to endure the great hardships of captivity for their country, often suffering undescribable physical and mental restraint. Such a token of gratitude would show to these heroes that they, too, had not been forgotten and that their sacrifice is duly appreciated and will permanently be remembered. It seems that in the last European war prisoner medals were issued privately only. The extensive search for such medals carried on by the author in numismatic literature and dealers catalogues as well as through interviewing of collectors and dealers, yielded only four items. Three are of German origin, only one is French. None of these medals has aroused as yet the attention or curiosity of numismatists in general or of collectors of medals in particular. Because of its medallic representation a typically German war medal will be mentioned first. No specimen was available to this writer. None is found in the Museum of the American Numismatic Society in New York City. It is a unilateral bronze medal, measuring 4 millimeters in diameter, designed by the German artist. Ludwig Gies, whose initials L.G. appear on the obverse. It is one of the numerous war medals created by him in the beginning of the First World War. It depicts the act of capture. A German soldier is shown capturing and taking away a French, a Russian, an English, Belgian, Serbian, and a colonial native prisoner of war. A brief description, but no reproduction of this medal, is found in J. Schulmans Catalogue LXV, of April 916, p. 2, No. 09. It is pictured among the artists other war medals in Max Bernharts Die Muenchener Medaillenkunst der Gegenwart, Plate 5/8, No. 02, wherefrom the reproduction is made. The medal reproduced here as No., another German war prisoner medal, is a silver medal, of 7.7 grams, measuring forty-one millimeters in diameter. The obverse depicts the full figure of a German prisoner of war, dressed in his uniform, on which a sign visible. Standing on the shore of a river, being of course the Rhine, he holds his hands stretched out to express his fervent longing for his home country. Not only the mountains of the latter are visible on the opposite shore but also the home village with its little church in the foreground. The inscription in the left upper space of the medal, before the soldiers eyes, reads: (longing). The reverse bears the following inscription in a quadrangular space surrounded by ornaments: ZUM DER u., meaning, National Society for the Protection of German Military and Civil Prisoners of War. On the rim of the medal name and place of the producing firm are visible: C. Poellat, Schrobenhausen. The designers name does not appear on the medal. No year is given. In accordance with the aims of the issuing society the medal was probably destined to promote interest in and support of the German prisoners of war in enemy land. No records or accounts of the activities of this society were available in this country. Nevertheless it is safe to assume the following. Sending of food parcels from Germany was possible only in the first years of war. But even later, in the period of grave food shortage, funds were still needed and actually raised for clothing, and particularly for books, which were continuously sent to prisoner camps in great quantities. A specimen of this medal is in the collection of Dr. Bruno Kisch, New York City. There is a French counterpart to this medal. A small medal, 6 millimeters in diameter, similar to No. in its motives, but apparently more artistically designed, is known to have been struck in France. No specimen is available in this country. According to the brief description in J. Schulmans Catalogue it was designed by O. Yencesse and executed in a silvery white metal. The obverse shows a French soldier seated in an attitude of despondency. The inscription reads: POUR NOS. that is: For Our Prisoners. On the reverse a dove is visible bearing in its bill an olive branch. Below is the date 916. The motive of the issuance of this medal was patently fund raising. No. is a medal made of hard white metal, and struck for the German prisoners of war interned at Douglas, Isle of Man, to commemorate their detention there. Its diameter measures 6 millimeters. On the top there is a rectangular vertical loophole. The obverse shows the Douglas prison camp, in the foreground its barracks and huts, also an unfolded banner is visible; in the background a fortress at the left of the beholder, and a lighthouse at the right. Between the fortress and the lighthouse is the Manx triskelion or triquerta, occupying a prominent place in the upper center. The entire picture on the obverse is enclosed by a surrounding wreath of barbed wire. The reverse has a wreath of leaves with a panel in the middle. The inscription reads, in the upper segment: ISLE OF MAN; in the middle: AN wooden case with no ornament. Other wooden cases are known, on the cover of which an inlaid design is visible representing an open-jawed snake as the symbol of war. The words Weltkrieg are added on the case. This medal was pictured and briefly, though not exactly, described in The New York Times of August 6, 916. In The Numismatist of March 916, a reproduction with a few explanatory lines was also published, the medal having been exhibited at the January meeting of the New York Numismatic Club. Douglas, Peel and Knockaloe had been chosen as sites for the detention camps on the Isle of Man. Here many an alien who for years had followed some profession or trade in Great Britain was interned in 914 for the duration of the war. The English and German Relief Committees with the active cooperation of the American Young Mens Christian Association succeeded in performing what seemed to the New York Times correspondent at that time to have been an unheard-of feat under the existing conditions: the establishment of an art school for prisoners of war at Camp Douglas. Beside wooden boxes done in chip carving and in wood intaglio, the commemorative medals for German war prisoners were certainly the most artistic objects produced there. Through a strange irony of fate, they were strictly made in England. Some day they will be of historic value, said the New York Times correspondent in concluding his article. The art school was established in 915/8. From the inscription on the medals 914-915/8 it is clear that they must have been designed and executed in the latter year, three years before the war came to an end. No other war prisoners medals dating back to the First World War have come to the attention of the present author. Yet, there may be some that eluded him. He therefore would appreciate any additional information that readers should be kind enough to send American War-Prison Tokens and Medals. Historical Tokens The study of European money and medals issued for prisoners of war in 914-918, aroused little wonder the curiosity as to whether similar items came into existence in this country too. No war prisoners money or medal originating in the last war is known to the author. In his collection, however, five related items are found, four small tokens and one large medal, which are deserving the historians and medallists attention. All of them picture war prisons of ill fame. Four pertain to the Revolutionary War, the fifth to the Civil War. Thus it is pertinent to consider them all in this connection. Nos. A, B, and are copper tokens, each 1 millimeters in diameter. They are not historical items in that they have come down to us as immediate witnesses from the period of the Revolutionary War. They are rather medallic creations of an outspoken commercial character, but nevertheless historical tokens. Nos. A and B are identical with No. of a series of fourteen Historical Tokens issued by August B. Sage, a well-known New York coin dealer, in 85/89. No. in the present numbering is identical with No., and No. with No. of the same series.""","""War Prisoner Medals and Tokens""","1886","""War Prisoner Medals and Tokens have a rich history dating back to ancient times when prisoners of war were often subjected to harsh conditions and treatment. These medals and tokens serve as symbols of recognition and remembrance for those who endured the hardships of captivity. They hold significant value, not only as physical artifacts but also as reminders of the sacrifices made by prisoners during wartime.  One of the earliest known instances of using medals to honor prisoners of war dates back to the American Civil War. The Civil War saw the emergence of the first official POW medals issued by the Union Army to recognize captured soldiers. These medals served as a token of gratitude for the courage and resilience shown by prisoners in the face of adversity. The tradition of awarding medals to prisoners of war continued in subsequent conflicts, further cementing the practice as a way to honor and remember those who suffered captivity.  War Prisoner Medals and Tokens come in various forms, ranging from traditional medals to more personalized tokens. Medals often feature intricate designs and inscriptions that highlight the bravery and sacrifice of prisoners of war. These medals are typically awarded by governments or military organizations to individuals who have been held captive during wartime. They serve as a testament to the indomitable spirit of prisoners who withstood the hardships of confinement.  In addition to medals, tokens are also used to commemorate the experiences of prisoners of war. These tokens can take the form of coins, patches, or other small items that hold symbolic significance. Some tokens are personalized with the names or ranks of individual prisoners, serving as a poignant reminder of their identity and sacrifice. Others may feature symbols of resilience and hope to inspire those who face adversity.  War Prisoner Medals and Tokens play a crucial role in preserving the memory of prisoners of war and recognizing their contributions to the larger wartime effort. They serve as a tangible reminder of the human cost of conflict and the importance of honoring those who have endured captivity. These medals and tokens also serve as a means of fostering remembrance and healing for both prisoners of war and their families.  Beyond their symbolic value, War Prisoner Medals and Tokens hold historical significance as artifacts that document the experiences of prisoners of war. They offer a tangible link to the past, allowing future generations to learn about the hardships faced by those held in captivity during wartime. By preserving and displaying these medals and tokens, we ensure that the stories of prisoners of war are not forgotten and that their sacrifices are duly recognized.  In conclusion, War Prisoner Medals and Tokens hold a special place in military history as symbols of honor and remembrance for prisoners of war. These medals and tokens serve as powerful reminders of the sacrifices made by individuals who endured captivity during wartime. Through their intricate designs and symbolic significance, War Prisoner Medals and Tokens pay tribute to the resilience and courage of prisoners of war, ensuring that their legacy lives on for future generations to remember and honor.""","577"
"Spencer Herbert","""Not only, therefore, is legislative machinery complex, but it is made of inferior materials. Hence the blunders we daily read of the supplying to the dockyards from the royal forests of timber unfit for use; the administration of relief during the Irish famine in such a manner as to draw labourers from the field, and diminish the subsequent harvest by one-fourth; the filing of patents at three different offices and keeping an index at none. Everywhere does this bungling show itself, from the elaborate failure of House of Commons ventilation down to the publication of The London Gazette, which invariably comes out wrongly folded. A further characteristic of officialism is its extravagance. In its chief departments, Army, Navy, and Church, it employs far more officers than are needful, and pays some of the useless ones exorbitantly. The work done by the Sewers Commission has cost, as Sir B. Hall tells us, from 00 to 00 per cent, over the contemplated outlay; while the management charges have reached 5/8, 0, and 5/8 per cent. on the expenditure. The trustees of Ramsgate Harbour a harbour, by the way, that has taken a century to complete are spending 8,00l. a year in doing what 000l. has been proved sufficient for. The Board of Health is causing new surveys to be made of all the towns under its control a proceeding which, as Mr. Stephenson states, and as every tyro in engineering knows, is, for drainage purposes, a wholly needless expense. These public agencies are subject to no such influence as that which obliges private enterprise to be economical. Traders and mercantile bodies succeed by serving society cheaply. Such of them as cannot do this are continually supplanted by those who can. They cannot saddle the nation with the results of their extravagance, and so are prevented from being extravagant. On works that are to return a profit it does not answer to spend 8 per cent. of the capital in superintendence, as in the engineering department of the Indian Government; and Indian railway companies, knowing this, manage to keep their superintendence charges within per cent. A shopkeeper leaves out of his accounts no item analogous to that,00,00l. of its revenues, which Parliament allows to be deducted on the way to the Exchequer. Walk through a manufactory, and you see that the stern alternatives, carefulness or ruin, dictate the saving of every penny; visit one of the national dockyards, and the comments you make on any glaring wastefulness are carelessly met by the slang phrase Nunky pays. See Evidence of Major Larcom. The unadaptiveness of officialism is another of its vices. Unlike private enterprise which quickly modifies its actions to meet emergencies unlike the shopkeeper who promptly finds the wherewith to satisfy a sudden demand unlike the railway company which doubles its trains to carry a special influx of passengers; the law-made instrumentality lumbers on under all varieties of circumstances through its ordained routine at its habitual rate. By its very nature it is fitted only for average requirements, and inevitably fails under unusual requirements. You cannot step into the street without having the contrast thrust upon you. Is it summer? You see the water-carts going their prescribed rounds with scarcely any regard to the needs of the weather to-day sprinkling afresh the already moist roads; to-morrow bestowing their showers with no greater liberality upon roads cloudy with dust. Is it winter? You see the scavengers do not vary in number and activity according to the quantity of mud; and if there comes a heavy fall of snow, you find the thoroughfares remaining for nearly a week in a scarcely passable state, without an effort being made, even in the heart of London, to meet the exigency. The late snow-storm, indeed, supplied a neat antithesis between the two orders of agencies in the effects it respectively produced on omnibuses and cabs. Not being under a law-fixed tariff, the omnibuses put on extra horses and raised their fares. The cabs on the contrary, being limited in their charges by an Act of Parliament which, with the usual shortsightedness, never contemplated such a contingency as this, declined to ply, deserted the stands and the stations, left luckless travellers to stumble home with their luggage as best they might, and so became useless at the very time of all others when they were most wanted! Not only by its unsusceptibility of adjustment does officialism entail serious inconveniences, but it likewise entails great injustices. In this case of cabs for example, it has resulted since the late change of law, that old cabs, which were before saleable at 0l. and 2l. each, are now unsaleable and have to be broken up; and thus legislation has robbed cab-proprietors of part of their capital. Again, the recently-passed Smoke-Bill for London, which applies only within certain prescribed limits, has the effect of taxing one manufacturer while leaving untaxed his competitor working within a quarter of a mile; and so, as we are credibly informed, gives one an advantage of 5/800l. a year over another. These typify the infinity of wrongs, varying in degrees of hardship, which legal regulations necessarily involve. Society, a living growing organism, placed within apparatuses of dead, rigid, mechanical formulas, cannot fail to be hampered and pinched. The only agencies which can efficiently serve it, are those through which its pulsations hourly flow, and which change as it changes. How invariably officialism becomes corrupt every one knows. Exposed to no such antiseptic as free competition not dependent for existence, as private unendowed organizations are, on the maintenance of a vigorous vitality; all law-made agencies fall into an inert, over-fed state, from which to disease is a short step. Salaries flow in irrespective of the activity with which duty is performed; continue after duty wholly ceases; become rich prizes for the idle well born; and prompt to perjury, to bribery, to simony. East India directors are elected not for any administrative capacity they have; but they buy votes by promised patronage a patronage alike asked and given in utter disregard of the welfare of a hundred millions of people. Registrars of wills not only get many thousands a year each for doing work which their miserably paid deputies leave half done; but they, in some cases, defraud the revenue, and that after repeated reprimands. Dockyard promotion is the result not of efficient services, but of political favouritism. That they may continue to hold rich livings, clergymen preach what they do not believe; bishops make false returns of their revenues; and at their elections to fellowships, well-to-do priests severally make oath that they are pauper, pius et doctus. From the local inspector whose eyes are shut to an abuse by a contractors present, up to the prime minister who finds lucrative berths for his relations, this venality is daily illustrated; and that in spite of public reprobation and perpetual attempts to prevent it. As we once heard said by a State-official of twenty-five years standing Wherever there is government there is villainy. It is the inevitable result of destroying the direct connexion between the profit obtained and the work performed. No incompetent person hopes, by offering a douceur in the Times to get a permanent place in a mercantile office. But where, as under government, there is no employers self-interest to forbid where the appointment is made by some one on whom inefficiency entails no loss; there a douceur is operative. In hospitals, in public charities, in endowed schools, in all social agencies in which duty done and income gained do not go hand in hand, the like corruption is found; and is great in proportion as the dependence of income upon duty is remote. In State-organizations, therefore, corruption is unavoidable. In trading-organizations it rarely makes its appearance; and when it does, the instinct of self-preservation soon provides a remedy. To all which broad contrasts add this, that while private bodies are enterprising and progressive, public bodies are unchanging, and, indeed, obstructive. That officialism should be inventive nobody expects. That it should go out of its easy mechanical routine to introduce improvements, and this at a considerable expense of thought and application, without the prospect of profit, is not to be supposed. But it is not simply stationary; it resists every amendment either in itself or in anything with which it deals. Until now that County Courts are taking away their practice, all agents of the law have doggedly opposed law-reform. The universities have maintained an old curriculum for centuries after it ceased to be fit; and are now struggling to prevent a threatened reconstruction. Every postal improvement has been vehemently protested against by the postal authorities. Mr. Whiston can say how pertinacious is the conservatism of Church grammar-schools. Not even the gravest consequences in view preclude official resistance: witness the fact that though, as already mentioned, Professor Barlow reported in 820, of the Admiralty compasses then in store, that at least one-half were mere lumber, yet notwithstanding the constant risk of shipwrecks thence arising, very little amelioration in this state of things appears to have taken place until 838 to 840.""","""Failures of Government and Officialism""","1946","""Government failures and the pitfalls of officialism stand as significant challenges that can hinder societal progress and undermine public trust in governing bodies. When governments veer off course, the repercussions are widespread, affecting citizens, economies, and the overall well-being of nations. Understanding the root causes of these failures is crucial to rectifying them and building a more effective and accountable system of governance.  One of the primary failures of government stems from a lack of transparency and accountability. When officials operate behind closed doors, making decisions without public scrutiny, it creates an environment ripe for corruption and abuse of power. The lack of transparency erodes trust in government institutions and leads to a disconnect between the rulers and the ruled. Citizens are left feeling disenfranchised and powerless, further exacerbating the legitimacy crisis that many governments face.  Moreover, bureaucratic inefficiencies plague many government agencies, leading to delays, red tape, and wasted resources. The sheer size and complexity of government structures can often result in inefficiencies that impede timely decision-making and hamper the delivery of vital services to the public. These inefficiencies not only waste taxpayer money but also hinder the government's ability to respond effectively to pressing issues such as public health crises, natural disasters, and economic downturns.  Another common failure of government is the persistence of systemic inequalities and injustices. Despite efforts to promote equality and social justice, many governments struggle to address deep-rooted structural inequalities that persist in society. Marginalized communities continue to face discrimination, lack of access to essential services, and economic opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and social exclusion. Government policies that fail to address these systemic issues only serve to entrench existing disparities, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots.  In addition, political polarization and gridlock can paralyze government functions, preventing meaningful progress on critical issues. When political parties prioritize partisan interests over the common good, governance becomes a zero-sum game where compromise and cooperation are seen as signs of weakness rather than strength. The resulting gridlock stifles innovation, prevents necessary reforms, and erodes public confidence in the ability of government to address pressing challenges.  Furthermore, the rise of authoritarianism and erosion of democratic norms pose a grave threat to the principles of good governance and the rule of law. In many parts of the world, leaders increasingly concentrate power in their hands, weakening checks and balances, undermining independent institutions, and silencing dissent. The suppression of civil liberties, freedom of the press, and peaceful assembly not only violates human rights but also sets a dangerous precedent that undermines the foundations of democracy.  To address these failures of government and officialism, concerted efforts are needed to promote transparency, accountability, and good governance. Governments must prioritize open and inclusive decision-making processes, engage with civil society, and uphold the rule of law to rebuild public trust and legitimacy. Bureaucratic reforms that streamline processes, eliminate redundancies, and enhance service delivery can improve efficiency and effectiveness.  Furthermore, addressing systemic inequalities requires comprehensive policies that promote social justice, equality of opportunity, and inclusivity. Governments must work to dismantle barriers to access to education, healthcare, employment, and social services, ensuring that all citizens have equal opportunities to thrive and contribute to society. Reducing political polarization and fostering a culture of cooperation and dialogue are essential to overcoming gridlock and advancing shared goals for the common good.  Finally, safeguarding democracy and defending human rights are essential tasks that require constant vigilance and active citizen participation. Upholding democratic norms, protecting freedom of speech, and ensuring the independence of the judiciary are vital to preserving the integrity of democratic institutions and preventing the slide into authoritarianism.  In conclusion, the failures of government and officialism are multifaceted and complex challenges that require multifaceted and nuanced solutions. By addressing issues of transparency, accountability, efficiency, inequality, political polarization, and authoritarianism, governments can work towards building more responsive, inclusive, and effective governance systems that serve the interests of all citizens and uphold the principles of democracy and the rule of law. Only through concerted efforts to confront these failures can governments regain public trust and fulfill their mandate to promote the common good.""","827"
"Sargeaunt John","""In reading Latin, the rhythmically-determined vowel-quantities of post-classical times were used; and the Roman letters were pronounced, first as they were in French, and afterwards as in English, but in the fourteenth century this made little difference. In Chaucer's time, the other nations of Europe, no less than England, pronounced Latin after the fashion of their own vernaculars. When, subsequently, the phonetic values of the letters in the vernacular gradually changed, the Latin pronunciation altered likewise. Hence, in the end, the pronunciation of Latin has become different in different countries. A scholar born in Italy has great difficulty in following a Frenchman speaking Latin. He has greater difficulty in understanding an Englishman's Latin, because in English the changes in the sounds of the letters have been greater than in any other language. Every vowel-letter has several sounds, and the normal long sound of every vowel-letter has no resemblance whatever to its normal short sound. As in England the pronunciation of Latin developed insensibly along with that of the native tongue, it eventually became so peculiar that by comparison the 'continental pronunciation' may be regarded as uniform. It is sometimes imagined that the modern English way of pronouncing Latin was a deliberate invention of the Protestant reformers. For this view there is no foundation in fact. It may be conceded that English ecclesiastics and scholars who had frequent occasion to converse in Latin with Italians would learn to pronounce it in the Italian way; and no doubt the Reformation must have operated to arrest the growing tendency to the Italianization of English Latin. But there is no evidence that before the Reformation the un-English pronunciation was taught in the schools. The grammar-school pronunciation of the early nineteenth century was the lineal descendant of the grammar-school pronunciation of the fourteenth century. This traditional system of pronunciation is now rapidly becoming obsolete, and for very good reasons. But it is the basis of the pronunciation of the many classical derivatives in English; and therefore it is highly important that we should understand precisely what it was before it began to be sporadic and inconsistent attempts to restore the classical quantities. In the following paper Mr. Sargeaunt describes, with a minuteness not before attempted, the genuine English tradition of Latin pronunciation, and points out its significance as a factor in the development of modern English. H.B.] It seems not to be generally known that there is a real principle in the English pronunciation of words borrowed from Latin and Greek, whether directly or through French. In this matter the very knowledge of classical Latin, of its stresses and its quantities, still more perhaps an acquaintance with Greek, is apt to mislead. Some speakers seem to think that their scholarship will be doubted unless they say 'doctrinal' and 'scriptural' and 'cinema'. The object of this paper is to show by setting forth the principles consciously or unconsciously followed by our ancestors that such pronunciations are as erroneous as in the case of the ordinary man they are unnatural and pedantic. An exception for which there is a reason must of course be accepted, but an exception for which reason is unsound is on every ground to be deprecated. Among other motives for preserving the traditional pronunciation must be reckoned the claim of poetry. Mark Pattison notes how a passage of Pope which deals with the Barrier Treaty loses much of its effect because we no longer stress the second syllable of 'barrier'. Pope's word is gone beyond recovery, but others which are threatened by false theories may yet be preserved. The New English Dictionary, whose business it is to record facts, shows that in not a few common words there is at present much confusion and uncertainty concerning the right pronunciation. This applies mostly to the position of the stress or, as some prefer to call it, the accent, but in many cases it is true also of the quantity of the vowels. It is desirable to show that there is a principle in this matter, rules which have been naturally and unconsciously obeyed, because they harmonize with the genius of the English tongue. For nearly three centuries from the Reformation to the Victorian era there was in this country a uniform pronunciation of Latin. It had its own definite principles, involving in some cases a disregard of the classical quantities though not of the classical stress or accent. It survives in borrowed words such as lis and stmina, in naturalized legal phrases, such as Ns Prius and nus probandi, and with some few changes in the Westminster Play. This pronunciation is now out of fashion, but, since its supersession does not justify a change in the pronunciation of words which have become part of our language, it will be well to begin with a formulation of its rules. The rule of Latin stress was observed as it obtained in the time of Quintilian. In the earliest Latin the usage had been other, the stress coming as early in the word as was possible. Down to the days of Terence and probably somewhat later the old rule still held good of quadrisyllables with the scansion of mlrs or mlrs, but in other words had given way to the later Quintilian rule, that all words with a long unit as penultimate had the stress on the vowel in that unit, while words of more than two syllables with a short penultimate had the stress on the antepenultimate. I say 'unit' because here, as in scansion, what counts is not the syllable, but the vowel plus all the consonants that come between it and the next vowel. Thus infernus, where the penultimate vowel is short, no less than supremus, where it is long, has the stress on the penultima. In volucris, where the penultimate unit was short, as it was in prose and could be in verse, the stress was on the o, but when ucr made a long unit the stress comes on the u, though of course the vowel remains short. In polysyllables there was a secondary stress on the alternate vowels. Ignorance of this usage has made a present-day critic falsely accuse Shakespeare of a false quantity in the line Coriolanus in Corioli. It may be safely said that from the Reformation to the nineteenth century no Englishman pronounced the last word otherwise than I have written it. The author of the Pronouncing Dictionary attached to the 'Dictionary of Gardening' unfortunately instructs us to say gladiolus on the ground that the i is short. The ground alleged, though true, is irrelevant, and, although Terence would have pronounced it gladiolus, Quintilian, like Cicero, would have said gladiolus. Mr. Myles quotes Pliny for the word, but Pliny would no more have thought of saying gladiolus than we should now think of saying 'labour' except when we are reading Chaucer. We need not here discuss the dubious exceptions to this rule, such as words with an enclitic attached, e.g. primque in which some authorities put the stress on the vowel which precedes the enclitic, or such clipt words as 'illuc', where the stress may at one time have fallen on the last vowel. In any case no English word is concerned. In very long words the due alternation of stressed and unstressed vowels was not easy to maintain. There was no difficulty in such a combination as honorificabili or as tudinitatibus, but with the halves put together there would be a tendency to say honorificabilitudinitatibus. Thus there ought not to be much difficulty in saying Constantinopolitani, whether you keep the long antepenultima or shorten it after the English way; but he who forced the reluctant word to end an hexameter must have had 'Constantinople' in his mind, and therefore said Constantinopolitani with two false stresses. The result was an illicit lengthening of the second o. His other false quantity, the shortening of the second i, was due to the English pronunciation, the influence of such words as 'metropoltan', and, as old schoolmasters used to put it, a neglect of the Gradus. Even when the stress falls on this antepenultimate i, it is short in English speech. Doubtless Milton shortened it in 'Areopagitica', just as English usage made him lengthen the initial vowel of the word. Probably very few of the Englishmen who used the traditional pronunciation of Latin knew that they gave many different sounds to each of the symbols or letters. Words which have been transported bodily into English will provide examples under each head. It will be understood that in the traditional pronunciation of Latin these words were spoken exactly as they are spoken in the English of the present day. For the sake of simplicity it may be allowed us to ignore some distinctions rightly made by phoneticians. Thus the long initial vowel of alias is not really the same as the long initial vowel of area, but the two will be treated as identical. It will thus be possible to write of only three kinds of vowels, long, short, and obscure. The letter or symbol a stood for two long sounds, heard in the first syllables of alias and of larva, for the short sound heard in the first syllable of stamina, and for the obscure sound heard in the last syllable of each of these last two words in English. The letter e stood for the long sounds heard in genus and in verbum, for the short sound heard in item, and for the obscure sound heard in cancer. When it ended a word it had, if short, the sound of a short i, as in pro lege, rege, grege, as also in unstressed syllables in such words as precentor and regalia. The letter i stood for the two long sounds heard in minor and in circus and for the short sound heard in premium and incubus.""","""Latin Pronunciation in English Language""","2028","""Latin pronunciation in the English language holds a significant place due to Latin's historical influence on English vocabulary and grammar. Understanding how to pronounce Latin words correctly is crucial for academics, professionals, and anyone interested in Latin literature, history, or language. While Latin is considered a """"dead"""" or extinct language, its impact on English pronunciation and vocabulary remains unmistakable. In this exploration, we will delve into the intricacies of Latin pronunciation in English, discussing key pronunciation rules, common pitfalls, and the importance of accurate pronunciation in various contexts.  One of the fundamental aspects of Latin pronunciation is the pronunciation of vowels. In Latin, vowels are generally pronounced consistently, unlike the variable pronunciation of vowels in English. For instance, the Latin vowel """"a"""" is pronounced as """"ah,"""" """"e"""" as """"eh"""" or """"ay,"""" """"i"""" as """"ee,"""" """"o"""" as """"oh,"""" and """"u"""" as """"oo."""" Understanding and mastering these basic vowel sounds are crucial for accurate Latin pronunciation.  Consonants also play a vital role in Latin pronunciation. While many Latin consonants are pronounced similarly to English, there are some distinct differences. For example, the letter """"c"""" is always pronounced as a hard """"k"""" sound before """"a,"""" """"o,"""" and """"u"""" (e.g., caesar, corona, cultura). However, before """"e"""" and """"i,"""" """"c"""" is pronounced as a soft """"ch"""" sound, akin to the English """"ch"""" in """"cheese"""" (e.g., celsius, cibus). Similarly, the letter """"g"""" follows a similar pattern, with a hard """"g"""" sound before """"a,"""" """"o,"""" and """"u"""" (e.g., gladius, gaudium) and a soft """"j"""" sound before """"e"""" and """"i"""" (e.g., genus, gilvus).  Moreover, Latin pronunciation involves paying attention to syllable stress. In Latin words, the second-to-last syllable is typically stressed. Understanding where to place the stress in a Latin word is essential for conveying meaning accurately and fluently. This emphasis on syllable stress sets Latin apart from English, where stress patterns can vary widely and are often unpredictable.  Furthermore, the Latin language features specific diphthongs, which are pairs of vowels pronounced as a single syllable. Common Latin diphthongs include """"ae"""" (pronounced like """"eye""""), """"oe"""" (pronounced like """"oy""""), and """"au"""" (pronounced like """"ow""""). Correctly pronouncing these diphthongs adds authenticity and fluency to spoken Latin.  One aspect that poses a challenge for English speakers learning Latin pronunciation is the presence of silent letters. In Latin words, each letter is pronounced, unlike in English where silent letters are common. Keeping this in mind while learning Latin pronunciation can help prevent errors and misinterpretations.  As Latin pronunciation in English is often encountered in academic and professional settings, mastering the correct pronunciation is imperative. Latin phrases are commonly used in law, medicine, theology, and scientific fields, among others. Accuracy in pronunciation not only demonstrates linguistic competence but also enhances credibility and clarity when using Latin terminology.  Additionally, accurate Latin pronunciation is essential for appreciating Latin literature, music, and art. Correctly pronouncing Latin words in poems, hymns, and historical texts allows for a deeper understanding and connection to the cultural richness of the Latin language. Furthermore, accurate pronunciation can enhance performances of Latin music pieces or theatrical works, adding authenticity and depth to the artistic interpretation.  In conclusion, Latin pronunciation in the English language is a fascinating journey into the historical and linguistic connections between these two languages. Understanding the nuances of Latin pronunciation, including vowel sounds, consonant rules, syllable stress, diphthongs, and silent letters, is crucial for accurate and fluent pronunciation. Whether for academic, professional, or cultural endeavors, mastering Latin pronunciation enriches communication and appreciation of Latin's enduring legacy in today's world.""","805"
"Morley John","""To the Duke of Argyll he wrote:-- Dec. 8, '2.--I have been touching upon deep and dangerous subjects at Liverpool. Whether I went beyond my province many may doubt. But of the extent of the mischief I do not doubt any more than of its virulence. All that I hear from day to day convinces me of the extension of this strange epidemic, for it is not, considering how it comes, worthy of being called a rational or scientific process. Be it however, what it may, we politicians are children playing with toys in comparison to that great work of and for manhood, which has to be done, and will yet be done, in restoring belief. Sir Robert Morier sent him from Munich Frohschammer's reply to Strauss. 'If I understand him aright,' said Mr. Gladstone, 'he is a Unitarian, minus Miracle and Inspiration.' The whole book seemed to him able, honest, and diligent:-- But, he adds, I am one of those who think the Christianity of like a tall tree scientifically prepared for the saw by the preliminary process, well known to wood-cutters, of clearing away with the axe all projecting roots, which as long as they remained rendered the final operation impossible. This first process leaves the tree standing in a very trim condition, much more mathematical in form, as it is more near a cylinder, than in its native state. The business of the saw, when the horse and the man arrive, is soon accomplished. To his article on ritualism he prefixed as motto two short lines of Pindar, about days that are to come being wisest witnesses.(27) In spite of retreat, it was impossible that he should forget the vast responsibility imposed upon him, both by his gifts and by the popular ascendency into which they had brought him. His was not the retreat of self-indulgence, and the days that were to come speedily brought him duties that were to bear him far into regions of storm and conflict now unforeseen. Meanwhile, with occasional visits to Westminster, he lived even and industrious days at Hawarden, felling trees, working at Greek mythology and ethnology, delighting in the woods and glades of the park, above all delighting in the tranquillity of his 'temple of peace.' Besides being the bookroom of a student, this was still a far-shining beacon in the popular eye. If sages, scholars, heroes, saints, with time's serene and hallowed gravity looked upon him from their shelves, yet loud echoes sounded in his ear from roaring surges of an outer world--from turbid ebb and flow of all the struggle and clamorous hopes and half-blind mysterious instincts of the nations. Chapter III. The Octagon. It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.--. Near the end of the eighties, Mr. Gladstone built for himself a fire-proof room at the north-western corner of his temple of peace. In this Octagon--'a necessity of my profession and history'--he stored the letters and papers of his crowded lifetime. He estimated the 'selected letters' addressed to himself at sixty thousand, and the mass of other letters that found their way into the Octagon without selection, along with more than a score of large folios containing copies of his own to other people, run to several tens of thousands more. There are between five and six hundred holographs from the Queen, afterward designated by him in his will to be an heirloom. 'It may amuse you,' he told Lord Granville, who always wrote the shortest letters that ever were known, 'to learn that your letters to me weigh fifteen pounds and a-half.' Probably no single human being ever received sixty thousand letters worth keeping, and of these it is safe to say that three-fourths of them might as well have been destroyed as soon as read, including a certain portion that might just as well never have been either written or read. This slightly improvident thrift recalls the jealous persons who will not suffer the British Museum to burn its rubbish, on the curious principle that what was never worth producing must always be worth preserving. (M168) As for Mr. Gladstone's own share, he explains his case in what he the widow of Mr. Cobden: 'Of the kind of correspondence properly called private and personal, I have none: indeed for many long long years it has been out of my power, except in very few instances, to keep up this kind of correspondence.' The exceptions are few indeed. Half of the contents of this crowded little chamber are papers of business,--nightly letters to the Queen, telling her what had gone on in the House and what sort of figure had been cut by its debaters, reports of meetings of the cabinet, memoranda for such meetings, notes for speeches, endless correspondence with colleagues, and all the other operations incident to the laborious machinery of government in the charge of a master engineer. In this region of his true calling, all is order, precision, persistency, and the firmness and ease of the strong. For many years in that department all was action, strength, success. Church leaders again contribute considerable piles, but these, too, mainly concern church business for the hour, and the business has now even for adherents naturally fallen out of memory. The more miscellaneous papers are different. There a long and strange procession flits before our eye--dreams, 'little bustling passions,' trivialities, floating like a myriad motes into the dim Octagon. We are reminded how vast a space in our ever-dwindling days is consumed by social invitations and the discovery of polite reasons for evading them. 'Bona verba' is a significant docket prompting the secretary's reply. It is borne in upon us how grievously the burden of man's lot is aggravated by slovenly dates, illegible signatures, and forgetfulness that writing is something meant to be read. There is a mountain of letters from one correspondent so mercilessly written, that the labour of decyphering them would hardly be justified, even if one could hope to recover traces of the second decade of Livy or the missing books of the Annals of Tacitus. Foreign rulers, Indian potentates, American citizens, all write to the most conspicuous Englishman of the time. In an unformed hand a little princess thanks him for a photograph, and says, 'I am so glad to have seen you at Windsor, and will try and remember you all my life.' There are bushels of letters whose writers 'say all that they conscientiously can' for applicants, nominees, and candidates in every line where a minister is supposed to be able to lend a helping hand if he likes. Actors send him boxes, queens of song press on him lozenges infallible for the vocal cords, fine ladies dabbling in Italian seek counsel, and not far off, what is more to the point, are letters from young men thanking him for his generosity in aiding them to go to Oxford with a view to taking orders. Charles Kean, a popular tragedian of those times, and son of one more famous still, thanks Mr. Gladstone for his speech at a complimentary dinner to have said that to peruse the papers of a prime minister must lower one's view of human nature. Perhaps this may partly depend upon the prime minister, partly on the height of our expectations from our fellow-creatures. If such a survey is in any degree depressing, there can be no reason why it should be more so than any other large inspection of human life. In the Octagon as in any similar repository we come upon plenty of baffled hopes, chagrin in finding a career really ended, absurd over-estimates of self, over-estimates of the good chances of the world, vexation of those who have chosen the wrong path at the unfair good luck of those who have chosen the right. We may smile, but surely in good-natured sympathy, at the zeal of poor ladies for a post for husbands of unrecognised merit, or at the importunity of younger sons with large families but inadequate means. Harmless things of this sort need not turn us into satirists or cynics. All the riddles of the great public world are there--why one man becomes prime minister, while another who ran him close at school and college ends with a pension from the civil list; why the same stable and same pedigree produce a Derby winner and the poor cab-hack; why one falls back almost from the start, while another runs famously until the corner, and then his vaulting ambition dwindles to any place of 'moderate work and decent emolument'; how new competitors swim into the field of vision; how suns rise and set with no return, and vanish as if they had never been suns but only ghosts or bubbles; how in these time-worn papers, successive generations of active men run chequered courses, group following group, names blazing into the fame of a day, then like the spangles of a rocket expiring. Men write accepting posts, all excitement, full of hope and assurance of good work, and then we remember how quickly clouds came and the office ended in failure and torment. In the next pigeon-hole just in the same way is the radiant author's gift of his book that after all fell still-born. One need not be prime minister to know the eternal tale of the vanity of human wishes, or how men move, Thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse To throw that faint thin line upon the shore. (28) Nor are things all one way.""","""Gladstone's thoughts on politics and religion""","2016","""William Ewart Gladstone, a prominent figure in British politics during the 19th century, held strong convictions regarding the intersection of politics and religion. Born in 1809, Gladstone served as Prime Minister four times between 1868 and 1894, leaving an indelible mark on both British politics and the role of religion in governance.  Gladstone's views on politics and religion were deeply intertwined, shaped by his devout Anglican faith and his belief in the moral imperative of politics. He saw religion as the foundation of morality and believed it should guide political decisions. Gladstone's approach was rooted in his understanding of the Christian principles of justice, charity, and service to others as the bedrock of a just society.  A defining aspect of Gladstone's political philosophy was his commitment to social justice and reform. He believed that the state had a duty to alleviate the suffering of the poor and marginalized, viewing social inequality as a moral issue that required political action. His policies aimed to address the root causes of poverty and improve the living conditions of the working class through legislation such as the Education Act of 1870 and the Irish Land Act of 1870.  Gladstone's religious beliefs informed his stance on contentious issues of his time, such as Irish Home Rule. While he faced opposition from within his own party, Gladstone's support for granting Ireland greater autonomy was driven by his belief in justice and his conviction that it was a moral imperative to address the grievances of the Irish people.  Despite his devout faith, Gladstone's approach to politics was not dogmatic. He recognized the importance of engaging with differing viewpoints and was known for his eloquence and ability to persuade through reasoned argumentation rather than coercion. His speeches and writings were characterized by their intellectual rigor and his unwavering commitment to his principles.  Gladstone's views on the relationship between politics and religion continue to be studied and debated. While some criticize his perceived moralizing and paternalism, others praise his principled stance on social issues and his dedication to using political power for the betterment of society.  In conclusion, William Ewart Gladstone's thoughts on politics and religion reflect a deeply-held belief in the moral responsibility of political leaders to uphold principles of justice and compassion. His legacy as a politician and statesman is marked by his unwavering commitment to using his power for the greater good and his belief in the transformative potential of politics when guided by moral values rooted in religious principles.""","496"
"Wormington H M  Hannah Marie ","""The problems which these ancient people faced stagger the imagination of modern man. They had no metal, no pottery, no cotton or wool, no draught animals. Really all they did have was their own ingenuity to wrest the necessities of life from a none too favorable environment. It is remarkable how, by utilizing wood, bone, stone, plant fibers, and even their own hair, they not only produced all that they needed to survive, but also provided a base from which arose the high culture which culminated in the great communal dwellings of later times. Were we able to project ourselves back into the time of the Basketmakers and watch the people of that day we should find men and women not too different from many Indians of today. The Basketmakers were rather short. They had coarse, black hair which, while straight, had slightly more of a tendency to waviness than that of present day Indians. Their skins were brown and they had little body hair. What clothing the Basketmakers wore, besides sandals, is not certain. Woven bands, sometimes referred to as gee strings, have been found in a number of sites but no mummy has ever been found buried with any loin covering. Many little aprons, consisting of waist cords to which was attached a fringe of strings of cedar or yucca fiber, have been found. Some of the longer ones, usually of cedar bast, were used as menstrual pads, but there are also a few shorter, finely woven, little aprons which probably served as skirts for women. Their scarcity, however, would suggest that they were not considered essential garments. Since the country in which these people lived is cold in the winter and can become quite chilly after nightfall even at other seasons of the year, they undoubtedly had some covering to give them warmth. Almost every body is found wrapped in a blanket made of fur and it is probable that these served as wraps and blankets for the living as well as shrouds for the dead. The manner in which these coverings were constructed is most ingenious. Strings were made of yucca fibres, then narrow strips of rabbit fur were wrapped around them. These fur covered strings were then tied together in close parallel rows, producing a light warm blanket. Sometimes they were ornamented with borders made of cords which had been wrapped with strips of bird skins. Some mantles of tanned deerskin were also made and it may be that there were some woven robes, for a few fragments of woven cloth have been found. These fragments bear patterns similar to those shown on the chests of individuals depicted in Basketmaker paintings on cliff faces, and they may have been parts of shirts or ponchos. It is also possible, however, that the designs shown in pictographs simply indicated body painting. The major item in the limited Basketmaker wardrobe was sandals. Anyone who has walked much in the canyon country of the Southwest can readily see how vital such equipment would be, and apparently the Basketmakers devoted much time and energy to keeping themselves shod. Sandals were woven of cord made from the fibers of yucca and apocynum, a plant related to the milkweed. They were double-soled, were somewhat cupped at the heel, and had a square toe which was sometimes thickened, but was usually ornamented with a fringe of buckskin or shredded juniper bark. To attach them to the foot there were heel and toe loops with a cord passing between them. These cords were often made of human hair. Hair was also sometimes used to provide the secondary warps in the sandals themselves. A few pairs of large coarse sandals have been found coated with mud and it is thought that they may have served as overshoes for wear in bad weather. Whatever the Basketmakers may have lacked in clothing, they compensated for with jewelry and ornaments. Our information is derived not only from mortuary finds but also from pictures painted on cliff faces by the Basketmakers themselves. Hair ornaments were widely used. Most of them consisted of bone points tied together to form comblike objects and topped with feathers. Feathers have also been found made into little loops and worn as pendants. Beads of all sorts were among the favorite means of decoration. They were used in making necklaces and as ear pendants. Some were of stone, carefully ground and polished, some of bone, sometimes engraved. Seeds and acorn cups were also used to make necklaces. Shells were very widely used, and it is interesting to note that many of them were olivella or abalone which can have come only from the Pacific coast. It seems unlikely that either the Basketmakers or their contemporaries along the coast were much given to transcontinental tours when their only means of transportation was their own sandal-shod feet, but the shells prove some sort of contact. Probably it was a contact by trade carried on through the peoples who inhabited the country between the two locales. This preoccupation with ornamentation might suggest some degree of vanity, and it is probably true that Basketmaker men gave a good bit of time and thought to their personal appearance. Basketmaker women, however, seem to have been a practical lot, far more concerned with material for their weaving than with their own appearance. The hair of female mummies is hacked off to a length of two or three inches. Of course cutting with a stone knife could hardly be expected to provide a particularly glamorous hair-do, and the fact that strands of hair seem to have been cut off at different times, presumably as the need for weaving material arose, added nothing to the general effect. While Basketmaker women would hardly furnish pin up material according to our standards, they presumably seemed attractive to Basketmaker men which, after all, was far more to the point. Basketmaker men usually wore their hair long and formed into three bobs tied with a string, one on either side of the head and one in the back. In some cases the hair was clipped away to form an exaggerated part and tonsure, and from the hair at the top of the head was formed a queue about the thickness of a pencil, which was wound with cord for the entire length. The reason for this variation in hair dressing is not known. Perhaps the rare form with the clipping and the queue had some ceremonial significance, or was a mark of rank. Brushes made of yucca fibers have been found, which we know were used for the hair. Human hair is found clinging to them and they are a form still used by some modern Indians. Having determined how these people looked we may now turn to the consideration of how they lived. For a great many years lack of evidence of house construction, coupled with the fact that most Basketmaker caves do not contain any great amount of ash and refuse, led to an acceptance of the belief that the Basketmakers either had no dwellings, or perhaps erected flimsy brush shelters which had since disappeared. Recent excavations near Durango, Colorado, however, have yielded evidence of well developed Basketmaker houses. Dates, tentatively assigned, fall in the early part of the fourth century. Doubtless, in other parts of the Anasazi province there were many other Basketmaker houses which have been destroyed by erosion, root, and frost action. Some of those found in the Durango area were in a cave and others on a terrace which had been made by cutting into the talus and removing the earth until a level surface large enough to accommodate the intended dwelling was produced. The house floors ranged in diameter from eight to thirty feet. They were saucer-shaped, formed of adobe mud not too smoothly spread over the surface of the excavation. The rim of the saucer was plastered against a series of short horizontal foot logs, laid to conform to the arc of the circle. These served as the foundation of the wall, the construction of which may be characterized as wood-and-mud masonry. Sticks and small timbers were laid around horizontally, and the interstices were crammed full of adobe to produce a strong, tough shell. The wall leaned somewhat inward as it rose to a convenient head height. Roofs were cribbed. Since the roof rested directly on the wall there was no necessity for stout vertical supporting timbers such as have been found in dwellings of the succeeding period. In no instance did a room boundary remain to a height sufficient to reveal the position, size, or shape of the entrance. At the approximate center of each floor was a heating pit (heating pit is used advisedly, because fire does not seem to have been maintained in the pits). Metates, varying from basin to trough shape, were a normal feature of each living surface. Interior storage devices occurred with great frequency. Some were merely slab-lined pits dug into the floor. Others were mud domes built entirely above the floor. The most common variety consisted of a combination of the two a sub-floor, slab-lined basin surmounted by a mud dome with an opening in the top. Even before these discoveries were made it had been known that the Basketmakers had some knowledge of construction. In the caves or shelters they built cists which provided storage space for corn and which often served a secondary purpose as a final resting place for the dead. Some were lined with grass and bark and may have been used as temporary sleeping places. The cists were oval or circular pits, usually dug in the cave floor. The average diameter was between three and five feet and the average depth about two feet.""","""Ancient Basketmaker Culture and Lifestyle""","1918","""Ancient Basketmaker Culture and Lifestyle  The Ancient Basketmaker Culture represents a fascinating chapter in the history of early human societies in the American Southwest. This ancient culture, known for its intricate basket weaving techniques and unique lifestyle, flourished in the region from around 1500 BCE to 500 CE. Through their artistic expressions, resourceful adaptations, and communal living practices, the Basketmaker people left a lasting legacy that continues to intrigue archaeologists and historians today.  At the core of the Ancient Basketmaker culture was their exceptional skill in basket weaving. The people of this era crafted baskets using a variety of materials such as yucca, willow, and other plant fibers. These baskets served as essential tools for storing food, carrying goods, and even as traps for hunting small game. The intricate designs and patterns woven into these baskets not only showcased the weavers' creativity but also reflected the importance of artistry in their daily lives.  In addition to their mastery of basket weaving, the Ancient Basketmaker people were adept at dry farming techniques. They cultivated crops like maize, beans, and squash in arid conditions, utilizing innovative irrigation methods to sustain their agricultural practices. This self-reliant approach to food production allowed them to thrive in an environment where water was scarce, demonstrating their deep understanding of the land and its resources.  The lifestyle of the Ancient Basketmaker Culture was characterized by a strong sense of community and interdependence. Villages comprised of clustered pit houses built partially underground provided shelter for families and served as gathering spaces for communal activities. These pit houses were constructed using a combination of stone, mud, and wood, showcasing the architectural ingenuity of the Basketmaker people.  Social structures within Ancient Basketmaker communities were likely egalitarian, with shared responsibilities for hunting, farming, and weaving. The division of labor was likely based on age and skill level, with each member contributing to the well-being of the group. Their close-knit social fabric fostered cooperation, mutual support, and a collective identity that bound them together in harmony with their environment.  Spirituality played a significant role in the lives of the Ancient Basketmaker people. Evidence of ritual practices, ceremonies, and symbolic artifacts suggests a deep connection to the spiritual realm. The presence of kivas, underground ceremonial chambers, in their villages points to their reverence for the natural world and their belief in the interconnectedness of all living beings.  The decline of the Ancient Basketmaker Culture around 500 CE remains a topic of scholarly debate. Factors such as environmental changes, resource depletion, or social dynamics may have contributed to the gradual transition to different cultural expressions in the region. The adoption of pottery-making techniques from neighboring cultures, as seen in the subsequent Puebloan societies, marked a significant shift in material culture and societal practices.  Despite the passage of centuries, the legacy of the Ancient Basketmaker Culture endures through the artifacts they left behind. Their exquisitely crafted baskets, utilitarian pottery, and architectural remnants serve as portals to understanding a civilization that thrived in harmony with nature. By studying their lifestyle, artistic expressions, and community values, we gain valuable insights into human adaptation, resilience, and creativity in the face of challenging environments.  In conclusion, the Ancient Basketmaker Culture stands as a testament to the ingenuity and cultural richness of early inhabitants of the American Southwest. Through their intricate basket weaving, sustainable farming practices, communal living, and spiritual beliefs, the Basketmaker people forged a unique identity that resonates through the ages. By delving into their history, we not only honor their legacy but also enrich our understanding of human diversity, creativity, and resilience in the tapestry of human civilization.""","732"
"Wilkinson William  1836","""One part of it stands upon a fine hill, and the other is situated in a valley. The princes palace is the most extensive edifice in the whole town, and is surrounded by gardens and yards. It is furnished in a style which is half Oriental and half European, and has room enough to lodge conveniently more than a thousand people. The palace of Bukorest was formerly a large building, standing on an eminence at one extremity of the town, and commanding a full view of it. In 813 it was accidentally burnt down, and it has not been rebuilt. The late prince had, since that time, resided in two private houses joined into one. Both capitals occupy a great extent of ground, the houses being separate from each other, and surrounded by yards or gardens, and trees. All the buildings are made of brick, and their walls, outside as well as within, are plastered and whitewashed. Tiles are seldom used, and the roofs are generally covered with wood. The streets of the two capitals, and indeed of all the provincial towns, are, without exception, paved with thick pieces of timber, thrown across, and made tight to each other. In some, the surface is made smooth and even, whilst in others, the logs of wood are almost left in their natural state. In the rainy seasons they are constantly covered over with a deep liquid mud, and in the summer, with a thick black dust, which the least wind renders excessively injurious to the eyes and lungs; besides these great inconveniences, a complete renewal, at least once in every six years, is absolutely necessary. At Bukorest, under the wooden pavements, to which the natives give the more appropriate name of bridges, there are large kennels, which receive the filth of the houses, and are meant to convey it to the river Dimbovitza, which runs through the town. Hardly any care is taken to keep the different passages open, and the accumulation of dirty substances frequently stops them up; in this state they sometimes remain for months in the hot season, during which they produce the most noxious exhalations, and occasion fevers of a putrid and malignant nature, diseases to which the natural position of the town must alone dispose a great part of the inhabitants. It has been long supposed, and it is still considered impossible to pave the streets with stone, not so much on account of the scarcity of the material, as owing to the ground being of a soft clay, which offers no hold to it. This idea, very prevalent among the natives, is certainly erroneous, and there cannot exist a more convincing proof of it, than the stone pavements constructed by Trajan and the Romans, which have so firmly withstood the destructive hand of time. From a certain distance, and on elevated ground, the city of Bukorest offers itself to the view with great advantage; the mixture of the houses and trees give it a peculiar beauty; but it is like the fine scenery of a theatre which charms the distant eye, and on being approached is found to be a coarse daub. As late as thirty years back, the Boyars were in the habit of visiting each other, and going to court on horseback, and the women of the most opulent only, went in coaches. Within that period, the fashion of riding in coaches has so increased, and it is now so universal, that no person of either sex, who has claims to respectability, can pass the gates of his house otherwise than in a coach, even in the finest weather. The Boyars consider it derogatory to their dignity to make use of their legs, and leave to the mob the vulgar practice of walking. The consequence is, that the streets, about seven or eight yards wide, are always full of carriages, and frequent accidents happen to the unfortunate pedestrians. The kind of carriage most in use, is the German caleche; and the Boyars have introduced the fashion of having theirs ornamented in the most gaudy manner; but as they do not so much regard the beauty of the horses and harness, nor the dress of the coachman, it is very common to meet in the streets a carriage glittering with gold, drawn by a pair of miserable hacks, and driven by a gypsy in rags. There are many coachmakers, both at Bukorest and at Yassi; but the carriages sent from Vienna are preferred to theirs, and much higher prices are paid for them. The Boyars are indifferent as to their solidity, and buy any old vehicle that is made up to deceive the eye, and is offered as new; fine ornaments being the only quality in estimation, every twelve or eighteen months they are obliged to purchase a new carriage. On another hand, their own inattention, and the lazy, slovenly, and careless habits of their coachmen, render this annual expense indispensable. No coaches of any kind are to be hired, so that travellers, and other non-residents, must submit to the necessity of going on foot. Private lodgings are also seldom to be had, and it was but very lately that a public hotel was set up at Bukorest, which, being well furnished, and provided with every requisite commodity, has become very useful to travellers. A German is the proprietor and director of it. The mode of travelling in the two principalities is so expeditious, that in this respect it is not equalled in any other country. Their post establishments are well organized; there are post-houses in all directions, and they are abundantly provided with horses. Every idea of comfort must, however, be set aside by those who are willing to conform themselves to the common method of riding post. A kind of a vehicle is given, which is not unlike a very small crate for earthenware, fastened to four small wheels, by the means of wooden pegs, and altogether not higher than a common wheel-barrow. It is filled with straw, and the traveller sits in the middle of it, keeping the upper part of his body in an erect posture, and finding great difficulty to cram his legs within. Four horses are attached to it by cords, which form the whole harness; and, driven by one postilion on horseback, they set off at full speed, and neither stop nor slacken their pace, until they reach the next post-house. Within the distance of half a mile from it, the postilion gives warning of his approach by a repeated and great cracking of his whip, so that, by the time of arrival, another cart is got ready to receive the traveller. The Boyars, and other people of respectability in the country, travel in their own carriages, and at their own pace. In winter, as the snow lies about two months on the ground, sledges are generally used, as well in town as in the country. The Wallachian breed of horses is of a peculiar kind. Their stature is very small, and they have no spirit; but they are strong, active, and capable of enduring great fatigue. Those of Moldavia differ only in being a little larger in size. Some of the richest people have their horses sent them from Russia and Hungary; but they are merely meant for their coaches, as, from an aversion to every exercise that occasions the least fatigue, hardly any of them ride on horseback. Handsome saddle-horses, consequently, are seldom seen in the country; the prince is the only person who keeps any; but they are chiefly used by his Albanians, or body-guard. VI. ON THE IN. TO THE.. OF THE OF WAR,, AND IN 806. THE OF THE TO. OF OF THE. WITH. WITH, AND TO IT. AND. S. S FROM. ON THE OF THE TO THE TWO. None of the events that had influenced the political existence, and undermined the public spirit of the Wallachian and Moldavian nations, proved more ruinous to them than the system of policy introduced by the Greeks of the Fannar, when they were placed at the head of the principalities. Humiliated, degraded, and oppressed as the Greeks were, since they had ceased to be a nation, civilisation degenerated among them, in proportion to the weight and barbarism of the yoke that had been imposed on them, and they had insensibly contracted those habits of corruption, and servile obedience, which must be inseparable from a state of slavery similar to theirs. Dissimulation and falsehood became the most prominent features of their character; and, in short, the force of the causes which acted upon them incessantly, familiarised them, by degrees, to every thing that could be degrading and humiliating to man. The ambition of certain Greeks, leading an obscure life at Constantinople, was, however roused, when the office of state-interpreter at the Porte, assumed an important appearance under the direction of their countryman, Alexander Mavrocordato, who, from a petty merchant at the island of Scio, rose by degrees to that station, and was sent in the quality of Ottoman plenipotentiary to the congress of Carlowitz, where he distinguished himself as an able negotiator. He caused his son Nicholas to be raised to the governments of Moldavia and Wallachia, and he suggested to the Porte a new mode of appointment to those principalities, after the elective right had been entirely set aside. The Ottoman court thenceforward appropriated those two dignities to individuals who had once served in the quality of state-interpreter to its satisfaction, not so much as a reward for their services, as on account of the knowledge obtained of their personal character and extent of abilities.""","""Architecture and social customs of Bucharest""","1985","""Bucharest, the capital city of Romania, is a place where the rich tapestry of architecture intertwines with deep-rooted social customs, creating a unique urban landscape that tells the story of its past and present. The architectural styles in Bucharest are a reflection of its complex history, ranging from medieval influences to the grandeur of Belle Époque buildings and the stark utilitarian structures of the Communist era. This diverse blend of architectural styles contributes to the city's charm and character, offering visitors a captivating journey through time.  One of the most iconic architectural landmarks in Bucharest is the Palace of the Parliament, also known as the People's House. This colossal building, constructed during the communist regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu, is a symbol of power and excess, with its imposing neoclassical facade and opulent interiors. The Palace of Parliament stands as a reminder of Romania's tumultuous past and the desire of its former dictator to leave a lasting legacy through architecture.  In stark contrast to the grandeur of the Palace of the Parliament, Bucharest also boasts a rich collection of Art Nouveau and Art Deco buildings that line its streets. The elegance and intricate details of these architectural gems capture the spirit of a bygone era, inviting visitors to admire the craftsmanship and creativity of the architects who designed them. Buildings like the Cantacuzino Palace and the George Enescu Museum exemplify the Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles, showcasing a harmonious blend of ornate decorations and modernist influences.  As one strolls through Bucharest's historic neighborhoods, such as Lipscani and Victoriei, they will encounter a mix of architectural styles that reflect the city's evolution over the centuries. The cobblestone streets and colorful facades of these districts exude a nostalgic charm, inviting visitors to explore hidden courtyards, quaint cafes, and bustling markets. Bucharest's architecture serves as a backdrop for social interactions and cultural exchanges, with locals and tourists alike gathering in its squares and parks to enjoy moments of connection and community.  Beyond its architectural riches, Bucharest is a city steeped in social customs that reflect the values and traditions of its people. Romanians place a strong emphasis on family ties and hospitality, often gathering for large meals and celebrations that center around food and drink. Traditional dishes like sarmale (cabbage rolls) and mămăligă (polenta) are staples of Romanian cuisine, served with generous portions of tuică (plum brandy) to toast to good health and happiness.  The social fabric of Bucharest is woven with customs that celebrate both religious and secular events, with holidays like Easter and Christmas being observed with fervor and joy. Romanians take pride in their cultural heritage, participating in folk festivals and events that showcase traditional music, dance, and craftsmanship. The Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum, located in Bucharest, offers visitors a glimpse into the rural traditions of Romania, with its collection of authentic peasant houses and artisanal workshops.  In contemporary Bucharest, social customs are evolving alongside the city's burgeoning art scene and vibrant nightlife. Young creatives are revitalizing abandoned buildings and industrial spaces, transforming them into galleries, theaters, and music venues that breathe new life into the urban landscape.

"Agg T R  Thomas Radford ","""If the pebbles are of rock of medium toughness, the smaller pebbles might be crushed under the heavier loads. It is the usual practice to permit gravel to be used for the foundation course in which the pebbles are as large as will pass a --inch circular screen opening, and for the wearing course, as large as will pass a --inch circular screen opening. If larger pebbles are allowed in the wearing course, the surface is certain to become rough after a time. If the gravel is to be placed in a single course as is a very common practice, then the maximum size should not exceed that which will pass a --inch circular screen opening. The Wisconsin Highway Commission has constructed a very large mileage of excellent gravel roads and the sizes specified for their roads are as follows: 'Bottom Course Gravel.--Bottom course shall consist of a mixture of gravel, sand and clay with the proportions and various sizes as follows: 'All to pass a two-inch screen and to have at least sixty and not more than seventy-five per cent retained on a quarter-inch screen; at least twenty-five and not more than seventy-five per cent of the total coarse aggregate to be retained on a one-inch screen; at least sixty-five and not more than eighty-five per cent of the total fine aggregate to be retained on a two hundred-mesh sieve.' 'Top Course Gravel.--Top course shall consist of a mixture of gravel, sand and clay with the proportions of the various sizes as follows: 'All to pass a one-inch screen and to have at least fifty and not more than seventy-five per cent retained on a quarter-inch screen; at least twenty-five and not more than seventy-five per cent of the total coarse be retained on a one-half-inch screen; at least sixty-five and not more than eighty-five per cent of the total fine be retained on a two hundred-mesh sieve.' 'Screened Gravel and Sand Mixtures.--Where it is impossible to obtain run of bank gravel containing the necessary binder in its natural state, screened gravel shall be used and the necessary sand and clay binder added as directed by the engineer. Gravel and sand shall be delivered on the work separately. Clay binder shall be obtained from approved pits and added as directed by the engineer.' 'Run of Bank Gravel.--When run of bank gravel is permitted either for one course or two course work, the size shall not exceed that specified for bottom or top course. If necessary, the contractor shall pass all the material through a two-inch screen for the bottom course, and through a one-inch screen for the top course. When the work consists of only one course, the material shall be of the sizes as specified for the top course. The necessary binder shall be contained in the material in its natural state, excepting that a small percentage of clay binder may be added as directed by the Engineer.' =Wearing Properties.=--A certain amount of grinding action takes place on the road surface under the direct action of wheels, especially those with steel tires. Where rubber tired traffic predominates, this action is much less severe than where steel tired vehicles predominate, but the tendency exists on all roads. In addition, there is distortion of the layer of gravel under heavy loads which causes the pieces of stone in the surface to rub against each other and to wear away slowly. The gravel road in the very best condition is slightly uneven but there is comparatively little jar imparted to vehicles, and, consequently, little impact on the surface. When somewhat worn, the impact becomes a factor of some importance and the pounding of vehicles has a very destructive action on the surface. Soft pebbles will be reduced to dust in a comparatively short time. The degree to which any gravel resists the destructive action of traffic depends upon the varieties of rock represented by the pebbles in the gravel. If the pebbles are mostly from rocks of good wearing properties, that quality will be imparted to the road surface. If mostly from rocks of little durability, the same characteristic will be imparted to the road surface. A very good general notion of the probable durability of gravel can therefore be obtained by a careful visual examination of the material and classification of the rock varieties represented by the pebbles. =Utilizing Natural Gravels.=--Gravel road construction is advantageous only when it can be accomplished at low first cost. This usually presupposes a local supply of gravel that can be utilized, or at any rate a supply that need not be shipped a long distance. In the nature of things, such deposits are likely to be deficient in some of the desirable characteristics, and may be deficient in most of them. By various means, the defects in the materials can be partially corrected while constructing the road. If the gravel deposit consists of layers of varying composition as regards size and clay content, the material may be loosened from the exposed face and allowed to fall to the bottom of the pit thereby becoming mixed to a sufficient extent to produce a reasonably uniform product. If deficient in clay, it often proves feasible to add a small part of the clay over-burden, thereby insuring enough binder. Sometimes adjoining deposits will consist one of relatively fine material, the other of relatively coarse. These may be mixed on the work by first placing the coarse material in a layer about inches thick and adding the finer material in a similar layer. The two will mix very rapidly during the operations of spreading and shaping. When deposits contain pebbles larger than will pass a --inch ring, these larger stones will prove to be undesirable if placed on the road, as they are almost sure to work to the surface of the gravel layer and become a source of annoyance to the users of the road. Oversize stone can be removed while loading the gravel or while spreading it, if care is exercised and not too large a proportion is oversize. It is preferable however to remove the oversize by means of screens at the pit. Usually on large jobs the oversize is crushed and mixed with the supply so as to utilize what is really the best part of the material. Gravels deficient in bonding material are often encountered in deposits where there is insufficient overburden to give enough additional binder or where the overburden is of a material unsuitable for binder. Such materials may be utilized by adding binder in the form of clay after the gravel has been placed on the road. Almost any gravel deposit can be utilized in some way if the material is of a durable nature, regardless of other characteristics. The serviceability of a gravel road will depend largely on how nearly the gravel approaches the ideal, but variations in the manipulations will do much to overcome deficiencies in materials. =Thickness of Layer.=--The thickness of the layer of gravel required depends both upon the type of soil upon which it is placed and the nature of the traffic to which the road will be subjected. Gravel surfaces should not ordinarily be constructed on highways carrying heavy truck traffic, but if gross loads of three or four tons are the heaviest anticipated, the gravel will be reasonably stable. On such roads, a layer of well compacted gravel ten inches thick will support the loads if a well drained earth foundation is provided. If but little truck traffic is anticipated and loads up to three tons on steel tires are the average, a layer inches thick will be sufficient. In dry climates, a layer six inches thick will be adequate if it can be kept from raveling. On secondary roads, carrying principally farm-to-market traffic, and not a great volume of that, the above thicknesses may be reduced about one-fourth. The exact thickness needed for any particular road is a matter for special study on account of the variations in the gravels and in the supporting power of the soil upon which they are placed. =Preparation of the Road.=--The roadway that is to be surfaced with gravel is first brought to the desired grade and cross section. It would be advantageous if this could be done a year before the gravel is placed so that no settlement of the earth foundation would occur after the gravel surface is completed. But if that is impractical, the grading may be done just prior to placing the gravel, providing appropriate methods are adopted for securing compacted fills. =Trench Method.=--Two distinct methods of placing the gravel are in general use, known as the trench method and the surface or feather edge method respectively. The method to adopt for any particular road will depend largely on certain conditions that will be explained later. In the trench method, a trench of the proper width and depth for receiving the gravel is excavated in the earth road surface and the gravel is placed therein. The trench is formed by plowing a few furrows and scraping out the loosened earth with a blade grader. The loose material is generally moved out laterally to build up earth berms or 'shoulders' alongside the gravel. Into this trench the gravel is dumped in the proper quantity to give the required thickness after being compacted. The greatest care must be exercised in spreading the gravel to eliminate unevenness where the loads were deposited. An ordinary blade grader is one of the best and most economical implements to use for spreading the gravel. When the gravel has been deposited in the trench for a distance of a thousand feet or more, the spreading is accomplished by dragging the surface repeatedly with the blade grader, the work being continued until all waviness disappears.""","""Gravel road construction specifications.""","1899","""Gravel Road Construction Specifications  Gravel road construction plays a crucial role in providing infrastructure for transportation in both urban and rural areas. When planning and executing a gravel road project, adhering to specific construction specifications is essential to ensure the road's longevity, safety, and performance. These specifications encompass various aspects of the construction process, including materials, design considerations, grading, drainage, and maintenance. By following these guidelines diligently, engineers and construction teams can create durable and cost-effective gravel roads that serve their intended purposes effectively.  Materials Selection and Quality Control The first step in constructing a gravel road is selecting appropriate materials. Typically, road construction gravel consists of a mix of various sizes of stone, sand, and fines. The selection of materials should be based on factors such as traffic volume, environmental conditions, and the road's intended use. High-quality materials are essential to ensure the road's strength, stability, and longevity.  Quality control measures are crucial during the sourcing and processing of materials. Specifications usually outline requirements for material gradation, particle shape, and durability. Quality testing, including sieve analysis and proctor compaction tests, helps verify that the materials meet the specified standards. Additionally, ensuring that the materials are free from contaminants like clay or organic matter is vital to prevent future road failure.  Road Design and Layout The design phase of gravel road construction involves various considerations to create a road that can withstand traffic loads and environmental stresses. Parameters such as road width, cross-section, superelevation, and curvature are determined based on anticipated traffic volumes and speeds. Proper design is critical for ensuring safe navigation, efficient water runoff, and minimal maintenance requirements.  Gravel roads are typically crowned to facilitate water drainage and prevent pooling, which can lead to erosion and road degradation. Specifications often include requirements for the road's slope, cross-fall, and ditch design to manage surface water effectively. Adequate drainage is essential to prevent water-related issues such as potholes, rutting, and washouts, which can compromise the road's integrity.  Grading and Compaction Proper grading and compaction of the roadbed are essential to create a stable foundation for the gravel surface. Specifications typically include guidelines for subgrade preparation, compaction methods, and moisture content control. Grading ensures proper road alignment, smooth transitions, and adequate cross-slope for water runoff.  Compaction is crucial to achieve the desired density and strength in the roadbed. Specifications may outline compaction requirements, including the type of compaction equipment, number of passes, and target density levels. Adequate compaction minimizes settling, rutting, and surface deformation, which can impact the road's performance and longevity.  Surface Material Application The application of gravel surface material is the final step in gravel road construction. Specifications detail the type and thickness of gravel to be used, as well as the compaction requirements for the surface layer. Proper application techniques, such as spreading, shaping, and rolling, help achieve a smooth, even surface that can withstand traffic loads and environmental conditions.  Surface maintenance is an ongoing concern for gravel roads, as wear and tear from traffic and weather can degrade the road surface over time. Regular grading, re-graveling, and dust control measures are typically recommended to maintain the road's integrity and performance. Specifications may include guidance on maintenance frequencies, techniques, and materials to ensure the road remains in optimal condition.  In conclusion, adhering to gravel road construction specifications is crucial for creating durable, safe, and sustainable transportation infrastructure. By following established guidelines for materials selection, road design, grading, compaction, and maintenance, engineers and construction teams can ensure that gravel roads meet performance standards and serve their intended purpose effectively. Attention to detail, quality control, and adherence to best practices throughout the construction process are essential for achieving long-lasting and cost-effective gravel road solutions.""","768"
"Still William","""Such are some of the representations that have been made in my hearing, and in regard to which, it has become your duty, as the Grand Inquest of the District, to make legal inquiry. Personally, I know nothing of the facts, or the evidence relating to them. As a member of the Court, before which the accused persons may hereafter be arraigned and tried, I have sought to keep my mind altogether free from any impressions of their guilt or innocence, and even from an extra-judicial knowledge of the circumstances which must determine the legal character of the offence that has thus been perpetrated. It is due to the great interests of public justice, no less than to the parties implicated in a criminal charge, that their cause should be in no wise and in no degree prejudged. And in referring, therefore, to the representations which have been made to me, I have no other object than to point you to the reasons for my addressing you at this advanced period of our sessions, and to enable you to apply with more facility and certainty the principles and rules of law, which I shall proceed to lay before you. If the circumstances, to which I have adverted, have in fact taken place, they involve the highest crime known to our laws. Treason against the United States is defined by the Constitution, Art., Sec., cl., to consist in 'levying war against them, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.' This definition is borrowed from the ancient Law of England, Stat. 5/8, Edw., Stat., Chap., and its terms must be understood, of course, in the sense which they bore in that law, and which obtained here when the Constitution was adopted. The expression, 'levying war,' so regarded, embraces not merely the act of formal or declared war, but any combination forcibly to prevent or oppose the execution or enforcement of a provision of the Constitution, or of a public Statute, if accompanied or followed by an act of forcible opposition in pursuance of such combination. This, in substance, has been the interpretation given to these words by the English Judges, and it has been uniformly and fully recognized and adopted in the Courts of the United States. (See Foster, Hale, and Hawkins, and the opinions of Iredell, Patterson, Chase, Marshall, and Washington, J.J., of the Supreme Court, and of Peters, D.J., in U.S. vs. Vijol, U.S. vs. Mitchell, U.S. vs. Fries, U.S. vs. Bollman and Swartwout, and U.S. vs. Burr). The definition, as you will observe, includes two particulars, both of them indispensable elements of the offence. There must have been a combination or conspiring together to oppose the law by force, and some actual force must have been exerted, or the crime of treason is not consummated. The highest, or at least the direct proof of the combination may be found in the declared purposes of the individual party before the actual outbreak; or it may be derived from the proceedings of meetings, in which he took part openly; or which he either prompted, or made effective by his countenance or sanction,--commending, counselling and instigating forcible resistance to the law. I speak, of course, of a conspiring to resist a law, not the more limited purpose to violate it, or to prevent its application and enforcement in a particular case, or against a particular individual. The combination must be directed against the law itself. But such direct proof of this element of the offence is not legally necessary to establish its existence. The concert of purpose may be deduced from the concerted action itself, or it may be inferred from facts occurring at the time, or afterwards, as well as before. Besides this, there must be some act of violence, as the result or consequence of the combining. But here again, it is not necessary to prove that the individual accused was a direct, personal actor in the violence. If he was present, directing, aiding, abetting, counselling, or countenancing it, he is in law guilty of the forcible act. Nor is even his personal presence indispensable. Though he be absent at the time of its actual perpetration, yet, if he directed the act, devised, or knowingly furnished the means for carrying it into effect, instigated others to perform it, he shares their guilt. In treason there are no accessories. There has been, I fear, an erroneous impression on this subject, among a portion of our people. If it has been thought safe, to counsel and instigate others to acts of forcible oppugnation to the provisions of a statute, to inflame the minds of the ignorant by appeals to passion, and denunciations of the law as oppressive, unjust, revolting to the conscience, and not binding on the actions of men, to represent the constitution of the land as a compact of iniquity, which it were meritorious to violate or subvert, the mistake has been a grievous one; and they who have fallen into it may rejoice, if peradventure their appeals and their counsels have been hitherto without effect. The supremacy of the constitution, in all its provisions, is at the very basis of our existence as a nation. He, whose conscience, or whose theories of political or individual right, forbid him to support and maintain it in its fullest integrity, may relieve himself from the duties of citizenship, by divesting himself of its rights. But while he remains within our borders, he is to remember, that successfully to instigate treason, is to commit it. I shall not be supposed to imply in these remarks, that I have doubts of the law-abiding character of our people. No one can know them well, without the most entire reliance on their fidelity to the constitution. Some of them may differ from the mass, as to the rightfulness or the wisdom of this or the other provision that is found in the federal compact, they may be divided in sentiment as to the policy of a particular statute, or of some provision in a statute; but it is their honest purpose to stand by the engagements, all the engagements, which bind them to their brethren of the other States. They have but one country; they recognize no law of higher social obligation than its constitution and the laws made in pursuance of it; they recognize no higher appeal than to the tribunals it has appointed; they cherish no patriotism that looks beyond the union of the States. That there are men here, as elsewhere, whom a misguided zeal impels to violations of law; that there are others who are controlled by false sympathies, and some who yield too readily and too fully to sympathies not always false, or if false, yet pardonable, and become criminal by yielding, that we have, not only in our jails and almshouses, but segregated here and there in detached portions of the State, ignorant men, many of them without political rights, degraded in social position, and instinctive of revolt, all this is true. It is proved by the daily record of our police courts, and by the ineffective labors of those good men among us, who seek to detach want from temptation, passion from violence, and ignorance from crime. But it should not be supposed that any of these represent the sentiment of Pennsylvania, and it would be to wrong our people sorely, to include them in the same category of personal, social, or political morals. It is declared in the article of the constitution, which I have already cited, that 'no person shall be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.' This and the corresponding language in the act of Congress of the 0th of April, 790, seem to refer to the proofs on the trial, and not to the preliminary hearing before the committing magistrate, or the proceeding before the grand inquest. There can be no conviction until after arraignment on bill found. The previous action in the case is not a trial, and cannot convict, whatever be the evidence or the number of witnesses. I understand this to have been the opinion entertained by Chief Justice Marshall, Burr's Trial, 95/8, and though it differs from that expressed by Judge Iredell on the indictment of Fries, ( Whart. Am. St. Tr. 80), I feel authorized to recommend it to you, as within the terms of the Constitution, and involving no injustice to the accused. I have only to add that treason against the United States, may be committed by any one resident or sojourning within its territory, and under the protection of its laws, whether he be a citizen or an alien. (Fost. C.L. 83,.-- Hale 9, 0, 2. Hawk. ch. 7,, Kel. 8). Besides the crime of treason, which I have thus noticed, there are offences of minor grades, against the Constitution and the State, some or other of which may be apparently established by the evidence that will come before you. These are embraced in the act of Congress, on the 0th of Sept., 790, Ch., Sec. 2, on the subject of obstructing or resisting the service of legal process,--the act of the d of March, 831, Chap. 9, Sec., which secures the jurors, witnesses, and officers of our Courts in the fearless, free, and impartial administration of their respective functions,--and the act of the 8th of September, 85/80, Ch. 0, which relates more particularly to the rescue, or attempted rescue of a fugitive from labor. These Acts were made the subject of a charge to the Grand Jury of this Court in November last, of which I shall direct a copy to be laid before you; and I do not deem it necessary to repeat their provisions at this time. Gentlemen of the Grand Jury: You are about to enter upon a most grave and momentous duty.""","""Legal inquiry into treason charges""","2077","""In the realm of law and justice, treason charges are among the most serious offenses an individual can face. The gravity of such accusations is not to be taken lightly, as they often involve acts that go against the very fabric of a nation. When the specter of treason looms, legal inquiries into the alleged actions become imperative to uphold the principles of justice, protect national security, and maintain the rule of law.  Treason, broadly defined, entails betraying one's country by aiding its enemies, levying war against it, or adhering to its enemies, giving them aid and comfort. This definition underscores the fundamental breach of allegiance and the potential harm to a nation's interests that treason represents. The legal framework surrounding treason charges varies from one jurisdiction to another but universally emphasizes the imperative of due process, fair trial, and the gravity of the accusations.  A legal inquiry into treason charges commences with the gathering of evidence. Law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and other relevant authorities work diligently to collect information that substantiates the allegations. This may involve surveillance, wiretapping, interrogations, forensic analysis, and other investigative techniques aimed at uncovering the truth behind the accusations.  Once evidence is amassed, prosecutors assess its validity and relevance to determine whether a case for treason can be established. This critical stage involves legal experts scrutinizing the collected data, consulting with relevant stakeholders, and preparing the groundwork for a potential trial. The decision to pursue treason charges is not made lightly, as the repercussions of such actions are profound and can impact not only the accused but also national security and public trust in the justice system.  If the decision is made to proceed with treason charges, the legal machinery is set in motion to bring the case to trial. The accused is formally charged, informed of their rights, and provided with legal representation to ensure a fair and just legal process. The trial itself is a meticulous affair, where evidence is presented, witnesses are called upon, and legal arguments are made to establish the guilt or innocence of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.  Throughout the trial, the prosecution and defense engage in a rigorous legal battle, where the intricacies of the law, the complexities of the evidence, and the profound implications of the accusations are dissected and analyzed. The role of the judiciary is paramount in ensuring that the trial is conducted fairly, impartially, and in accordance with the principles of justice. Judges preside over the proceedings, weighing the evidence, ruling on legal matters, and ultimately delivering a verdict based on the facts presented.  In cases of treason, the stakes are exceptionally high, given the potential consequences of a guilty verdict. Punishments for treason can vary but often include lengthy prison sentences, forfeiture of assets, and, in extreme cases, capital punishment. The gravity of the offense demands a commensurate response from the legal system, reflecting the severity of the betrayal and its implications for national security and sovereignty.  Furthermore, the legal inquiry into treason charges extends beyond the confines of a courtroom. It involves coordination with national security agencies, diplomatic efforts, and the broader framework of international law. Treason charges can have far-reaching implications for international relations, bilateral agreements, and the perception of a nation's commitment to upholding the rule of law.  In conclusion, legal inquiries into treason charges represent a critical juncture in the intersection of law, justice, and national security. The meticulous process of gathering evidence, preparing a case, conducting a trial, and delivering a verdict underscores the importance of upholding the principles of justice and the rule of law, even in the face of the most serious accusations. Treason, by its nature, strikes at the heart of a nation's values and interests, making the pursuit of justice in such cases a solemn duty that must be executed with precision, integrity, and a steadfast commitment to upholding the foundations of a just society.""","773"
"Anderson J D  James Drummond ","""The sectarian type is a singularly interesting example of the strong social influence of Hindu sentiment. Nearly all new Hindu sects begin by renouncing caste in the enthusiastic following of some single deity, some new explanation of the mysteries of life, and love, and death. These sects are usually the followers of some reforming theorist, whose leadership is apt to become hereditary. Such sects almost always believe that all men are equal, or at all events, that all who accept their doctrines are equal. One of my most interesting recollections is of a now distant interview with a buxom middle-aged lady, the hereditary leader of the Karta-bhajas of Central Bengal. She sat unveiled, and was accessible to all who, like myself, were interested in the community over which she exercised a firm but good-natured control. It is a picturesque detail that her chosen seat when receiving visitors was an ancient European four-poster bedstead. Her growing rapidly, increased chiefly by the democratic instinct which, even in India, revolts against social prestige. But it would seem that when such a sect grows and spreads, the old separatist ideas reassert themselves, and the sect breaks up into smaller endogamous communities, whose status depends on the original position of the members in Hinduism. The most remarkable instance of this kind is furnished by the great Lingayat caste of Bombay, which contains over two and a half millions of members. In the twelfth century the Lingayats were a sect who believed in the equality of all men. In Mr P. J. Mead's Bombay Census Report for 911 is a very interesting account of the present condition of the Lingayats, an account which shows how the scholar, the linguist, and the administrator can work together to find materials for the anthropologist. Dr Fleet's examination of ancient inscriptions has thrown much light on the origin of the sect, but the author of the Report holds that there may be some reason to think that the sect is much older than is commonly supposed. In any case, they are already divided into three great groups, comprising many subdivisions. Castes formed by crossing come aptly to show that there was some basis for Manu's theory of caste after all. Castes, nowadays, increase by fission, by throwing off sub-castes, and one species of these sub-castes is created by mixed marriages. This tendency, curiously enough, is most evident in Dravidian tribes, such as the Mundas, which are not yet wholly Hinduised, but have been affected by Hindu example. So far as I know, these mixed castes do not occur among the Mongoloid peoples, and I have come across cases where a member of an aboriginal tribe has been accepted into the caste of a Hindu girl he has married. In one case, within my own experience, the bridegroom had begun as an animist, had become Christian, and finally entered by marriage into the quite respectable Koch caste. One interesting caste in Bengal, that of the Shagirdpeshas, owes its origin to concubinage with the so-called slaves, the women of tenants surrounding a homestead who pay their rent in service. This, it will be observed, is a caste of illegitimacy, in which the relationship between the legitimate and illegitimate children of a man of good caste is recognised, but the two are not allowed to eat together. The classical instance of a mixed caste is the Khas of Nepal, said to be the result of very ancient intermarriages between Rajput or Brahman immigrants and the Mongolian 'daughters of men.' Castes of the national type. This somewhat daring title we owe to the great authority of Sir H. Risley. As one instance, he mentions the Newars, a Mongoloid people, who were once the ruling race in Nepal, till the Gurkha invasion in 769, and have now become a caste. Other instances might be found on the north-eastern frontier. But the people Sir Herbert Risley had in mind when he invented this term was undoubtedly the remarkable Maratha race, once the most daring warriors and freebooters in India, and now the rivals of the Bengalis in intellectual ability, and probably more than their equals in political sagacity. Sir Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar is our authority for the statement that the Rattas were a tribe who held political supremacy in the Deccan from the earliest days. In time they became Maha-rattas, 'Great Rattas,' and the land in which they lived was called Maharattha, which, by a common linguistic habit of mankind, was Sanskritised into Maha-rashtra. Their marriage customs show marked traces of totemistic institutions. An extremely interesting account of the present condition of this warlike and enterprising race will be found at pp. 89, 90 of the Bombay Census Report for 911. It neither supports nor discourages Sir H. Risley's ingenious theory of the Scythic origin of the Marathas, which is at least a theory which recognises the respect in which our ancestors held their martial prowess and talents. Castes formed by migration. These are new castes which serve to enforce the warning against a too ready acceptance of the definition of caste as a 'horizontal' division of humanity. It is a method of forming new communities of Hindus which is very easily intelligible to us, seeing that our own race is split into sections only differing from castes in not being strictly endogamous, such as Anglo-Indians, Australians, New Zealanders, and so forth. Members leave home and settle among strangers. They are assumed to have formed foreign habits, eaten strange food, worshipped alien gods, and have a difficulty an expensive difficulty in finding wives in the parent caste. After a time they marry only among themselves, become a sub-caste, and are often known by some territorial name, Barendra, Rarhi, or what not. Such seemingly are the remarkable Nambudri Brahmans of Malabar, and the Rarhi Brahmans of Bengal. Sometimes change of habitat brings about loss of rank, sometimes promotion. These are matters on which the Census Reports now being published are full of interesting details. But they are matters which are not easily summarised. No doubt Mr Gait's Report on the combined results of Census operations in India will show the progress of castes of this type during the last ten years. Castes formed by changes of custom. This is a fruitful cause of new divisions of Hindu society. It is, for the moment, more than usually operative, owing to the spread of education, and often represents a difference of social opinion which corresponds, more or less closely, to Conservative and Radical ideas among ourselves. It evidently was always a cause of fissiparous tendencies. The most notable instance is the distinction between Jats and Rajputs, both apparently sprung from the same stock, but separated socially, amongst other causes, by the fact that the former practise and the latter abjure infant marriages. This is a very rapid and highly summarised account of the races and castes of India. There are many obvious omissions. Nothing has been said of the Sikhs, little or nothing about the numerous races of the north-eastern frontier. But enough has been said to give a fair general impression of what the physical characters of the Indian peoples are, and what kind of institution caste is in its practical working. More might have been said about totemistic clans, but on this subject those who would pursue their studies further have only to turn to Dr J. G. Frazer's work on the subject. In the next chapter, I have to borrow my materials from Sir G. A. Grierson, and show how the peoples of India are divided by differences of language. On the whole, those linguistic divisions correspond with remarkable accuracy to the orographical and climatic structure of the country and the racial divisions which we owe to the learning and ingenuity of Sir H. H. Risley. Where there are great open plains, watered and fertilised by mighty rivers, we get large populations speaking the great literary languages of India. In the rugged recesses of the mountains we find small communities, divided from one another by physical obstacles which have produced rigid local patriotisms and enmities, and a wonderful variety of savage speeches. The linguist has usually worked independently of the ethnologist, and has come to his own unprejudiced conclusions. It is interesting to find how closely the results of their separate enquiries agree. Postscript. Sir H. H. Risley's theory as to the Scythian origin of the Marathas has not passed unquestioned, and those who wish to see a brief and clear account of the latest theories on the subject should read Mr Crooke's paper on 'Rajputs and Marathas' in Vol. XL. (January June, 910) of the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Mr Crooke, who gives copious references to the latest literature on the subject, holds that 'the theory that a Hun or Scythian element is to be traced in the population of the Deccan is inconsistent with the facts of tribal history, so far as they can now be ascertained.' Mr Crooke thinks that the anthropometrical facts can be explained otherwise than by Saka invasion and an infusion of Scythian blood. 'The presence of a brachycephalic strain,' he says, 'in Southern and Western India need not necessarily imply a Mongoloid invasion from Central Asia. The western coast was always open to the entry of foreign races. Intercourse with the Persian Gulf existed from a very early period, and Mongoloid Akkads or the short-headed races from Baluchistan may have made their way along the coast or by sea into Southern and Western India.""","""Caste systems and social dynamics in India""","2034","""Caste systems have been an integral part of Indian society for centuries, shaping social dynamics and influencing various aspects of life. This hierarchical system categorizes people into different groups based on their birth, occupation, and social status. While officially abolished in India, the impact of the caste system continues to be felt in modern society, affecting social relations, opportunities, and overall dynamics.  The origins of the caste system in India can be traced back to ancient texts like the Rigveda, where the four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras) were mentioned. Over time, these broad categories expanded into numerous sub-castes or """"jatis,"""" creating a complex network of social stratification. Each caste was assigned specific duties and responsibilities, with social interactions often dictated by these prescribed roles.  One of the key features of the caste system is the idea of purity and pollution. Higher castes are traditionally considered purer, while lower castes are viewed as impure. This notion has led to practices like untouchability, where certain castes were deemed so impure that physical contact was avoided to prevent contamination. Despite being outlawed, instances of untouchability still exist in some parts of India, highlighting the deep-rooted nature of these beliefs.  The caste system has had a profound impact on social mobility and opportunities for individuals. Historically, one's caste determined their occupation, marriage partner, and even social standing. While efforts have been made to promote equality and uplift marginalized castes through affirmative action policies like reservations in education and employment, challenges remain in achieving true social equality and breaking down traditional barriers.  In contemporary India, the caste system continues to influence social interactions, especially in rural areas where traditional practices are more prevalent. Inter-caste marriages, for example, are often met with resistance and social ostracism, highlighting the deep-seated prejudices that still exist within Indian society. Economic disparities between castes are also significant, with lower castes facing discrimination in access to resources and opportunities.  Despite its drawbacks, the caste system has also played a role in preserving cultural heritage and traditions. Each caste has its own customs, traditions, and practices, contributing to the diverse tapestry of Indian culture. Festivals, rituals, and social norms are often shaped by caste affiliations, enriching the cultural landscape of the country.  At the same time, there have been movements seeking to challenge and dismantle the caste system. Social reformers like B. R. Ambedkar, himself born into a lower caste, played a crucial role in advocating for the rights of Dalits (formerly known as """"untouchables"""") and other marginalized groups. The Dalit movement, in particular, has been instrumental in raising awareness about caste-based discrimination and advocating for social justice and equality.  In recent years, there has been a growing awareness and discourse around caste issues in India. With the rise of social media and increased connectivity, discussions on caste discrimination, representation, and privilege have gained prominence. Movements like #DalitLivesMatter and #CasteConversations have sparked important dialogues about caste-based inequalities and the need for social change.  Education and economic empowerment are often cited as key factors in addressing caste-based disparities. By providing equal opportunities for all individuals regardless of their caste background, society can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable environment. Initiatives that promote inter-caste marriages, encourage dialogue between different caste groups, and challenge stereotypes and prejudices are also essential in fostering social cohesion and unity.  In conclusion, the caste system remains a complex and multifaceted aspect of Indian society, deeply intertwined with social dynamics and cultural practices. While progress has been made towards dismantling caste-based discrimination, there is still much work to be done in promoting social equality and inclusivity. By acknowledging the historical legacy of the caste system and working towards a more equitable future, India can strive towards a society where individuals are valued not for their birth but for their abilities and character.""","802"
"Throop Lucy Abbot","""Curtains The modern window, with its huge panes of glass and simple framework, makes an insistent demand for curtains. Without curtains windows of this kind give a blank, staring appearance to the room and also a sense of insecurity in having so many holes in the walls. The beautiful windows of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Italy, England and France, give no such feeling of incompleteness, for their well-carved frames, and over-windows, and their small panes of glass, were important parts of the decorative scheme. Windows and doors were more than mere openings in those days, but things have changed, and the hard lines of our perfectly useful windows get on our nerves if we do not soften them with drapery. In that hopeless time in the last century called 'Early Victorian,' when black walnut reigned supreme, the curtains were as terrifying as the curves of the furniture and the colors of the carpets. Luckily most of us know only from pictures what that time was, but we all have seen enough remnants of its past glories to be thankful for modern ways and days. The over-draped, stuffy, upholstered nightmares have entirely disappeared, and in their place have come curtains of a high standard of beauty and practicality--simple, appropriate, and serving the ends they were intended for. The effect of curtains must be taken into account from both the outside and the inside of the house. The outside view should show a general similarity of appearance in the windows of each story, in the manner of hanging the curtains and also of material. The shades throughout the house should be of the same color, and if a different color is needed inside for the sake of the color scheme, either two shades should be used or they should be the double-faced kind. Shades should also be kept drawn down to the same line, or else be rolled up out of sight, for there is nothing that gives a more ill-kept look to a house than having the shades and curtains at any haphazard height or angle. And now to 'return to our muttons.' The average window needs two sets of curtains and a shade. Sometimes a thin net or lace curtain, a 'bonne femme' is hung close to the glass, but this is usual only in cities where privacy has to be maintained by main force, or where the curtains of a floor differ greatly. Thin curtains in combination with side curtains of some thicker material are most often used. Curtains either make or mar a room, and they should be carefully planned to make it a perfect whole. They must be so convincingly right that one only thinks at first how restful and pleasant and charming the whole room is; the details come later. When curtains stand out and astound one, they are wrong. It is not upholstery one is trying to display, but to make a perfect background for one's furniture, one's pictures and one's friends. There are so many materials to choose from that all tastes and purses can be suited; nets, thin silk and gauzes; scrims and batistes; cotton and silk crepes, muslin or dotted Swiss, cheesecloth, soleil cloth, madras, and a host of other fascinating fabrics which may be used in any room of the house. The ready-made curtains are also charming. There are muslin curtains with applique borders cut from flowered cretonne; sometimes the cretonne is applique on net which is let into the curtain with a four-inch hem at the bottom and sides. A simpler style has a band of flowered muslin sewed on the white muslin, or used as a ruffle. It is also added to the valance. There are many kinds of net and lace curtains ready for use that will harmonize with any kind of room. Some of the expensive ones are really beautiful examples of needlecraft, with lace medallions and insertions and embroidery stitches. When it comes to the question of side curtains the supply to choose from is almost unlimited, and this great supply forms the bog in which so many are lost. A thing may be beautiful in itself and yet cause woe and havoc in an otherwise charming room. There are linens of all prices, and cretonnes, both the inexpensive kind and the wonderful shadow ones; there are silks and velvets and velours, aurora cloth, cotton crepe and arras cloth, and a thousand other beautiful stuffs that are cheap or medium-priced or expensive, whose names only the shopman knows, but which win our admiration from afar. The curtains for a country house are usually of less valuable materials than those for a town house, and this is as it should be, for winter life is usually more formal than summer life. Nothing can be prettier, however, for a country house than cretonne. It is fresh and dainty and gives a cool and delightful appearance to a room. Among the many designs there are some for every style of decoration. The height and size of a room must be taken into account in hanging curtains, for with their aid, and also that of wallpaper, we can often change a room of bad proportions to one of seemingly good ones. If a room is very low, a stripe more or less marked in the design, and the curtains straight to the floor, will make it seem higher. A high room may have the curtains reach only to the sills with a valance across the top. This style may be used in a fairly low room if the curtain material is chosen with discretion and is not of a marked design. If the windows are narrow they can be made to seem wider by having the rod for the side curtains extend about eight inches on each side of the window, and the curtain cover the frame and a part of the wall. This leaves all the window for light and air. A valance connecting the side curtains and covering the top of the net curtains will also make the window seem broader. A group of three windows can be treated as one by using only one pair of side curtains with a connecting ruffle, and a pair of net curtains at each window. Curtains may hang in straight lines or be simply looped back, but fancy festooning is not permissible. There is another attractive method of dividing the curtains in halves, the upper sections to hang so they just cover the brass rod for the lower sections, which are pushed back at the sides. These lower sections may have the rod on which they are run fastened to the window-sash if one wishes. They will then go up with the window and of course keep clean much longer, but to my mind it is not so alluring as a gently blowing curtain on a hot day. I have seen a whole house curtained most charmingly in this manner, with curtains of unbleached muslin edged with a narrow little ruffle. They hung close to the glass and reached just to the sill with the lower part pushed back at the sides. The outside view was most attractive, and the inside curtains varied according to the needs of each room. Casement windows should have the muslin curtains drawn back with a cord or a muslin band, and the side curtains should hang straight, with a little top ruffle; if the windows open into the room the curtains may be hung on the frames. The muslin curtains may be left out entirely if one wishes. Net curtains on French doors should be run on small brass rods at top and bottom, and the heavy curtains that are drawn together at night for privacy's sake should be so hung that they will not interfere with the opening of the door. There should be plenty of room under all ruffles or shaped valances where the curtains are to be drawn to allow for easy working of the cords, otherwise tempers are liable to be suddenly lost. All windows over eighteen inches wide need two curtains, and the average allowance of fullness is at least twice the width of the window for net and any very soft material, while once and a half is usually enough for material with more body. Great care must be taken to measure curtains correctly and have them cut evenly. It is also a good plan to allow for extra length, which can be folded into the top hem and will not show, but will allow for shrinking. Stenciling can be very attractively used for curtains and portieres for country houses. Cheesecloth, scrim, aurora cloth, pongee, linen, and velours, are a few of the materials that can be used. The design and kind used in a room should be chosen with due regard to its suitability. A Louis XVI room could not possibly have arras cloth used in it, while it would be charming and appropriate in a modern bungalow. Arras cloth with an applique design of linen couched on it makes beautiful curtains and portieres to go with the Mission or Craftsman furniture. There is an old farmhouse on Long Island that has been made over into a most delightful country house, and the furnishing throughout is consistent and charming. The curtains are reproductions of old designs in chintz and cretonne. The living-room, with its white paneling to the ceiling, its wide fireplace, old mahogany furniture, and curtains gay with parrots and flowers, hanging over cool white muslin, is a room to conjure with. In town houses the curtains and hangings must also harmonize with the style of furnishing. When the windows are hung with soft colored brocade, the portieres are usually beautiful tapestry or rich toned velvets, and care is always taken to have the balance of color kept and the color values correct. There are silks and damasks and velvets, and many lesser stuffs, made for all the period styles, whether carried out simply or elaborately, and it is the art of getting the suitable ones for the different rooms which gives the air of harmony, beauty, and restfulness, for which the word home stands.""","""Curtains and window treatments design""","2034","""Curtains and window treatments are not just practical elements in a room; they also play a crucial role in the overall aesthetic appeal and ambiance of a space. Choosing the right curtains and window treatments can significantly impact the style, mood, and functionality of a room. From fabric selection to design choices, there are numerous considerations to keep in mind when it comes to dressing up your windows.  When selecting curtains and window treatments, it's essential to consider the overall design style of the room. Whether you prefer a modern, traditional, eclectic, or minimalist look, the window treatments should complement and enhance the existing décor. For a contemporary style, sleek and simple curtains with clean lines and minimal embellishments work well. On the other hand, a more traditional room may benefit from luxurious fabrics like silk or velvet with intricate details such as tassels or fringe.  Fabric choice is a fundamental aspect of curtain design. The type of fabric you choose can impact the functionality and aesthetics of the window treatments. Light and airy fabrics like sheer voile or linen can create a soft, ethereal look and allow natural light to filter through. Heavier fabrics such as velvet or brocade offer more privacy, insulation, and light control. The color and pattern of the fabric should also be considered – solid colors can lend a sense of sophistication, while patterns can add visual interest and personality to the room.  In addition to fabric, the length and style of the curtains play a crucial role in the design. Floor-length curtains are a classic choice that can make a room feel more formal and elegant. For a more casual look, curtains that hover just above the floor or window sill can create a relaxed vibe. Curtain styles like pinch pleat, grommet, rod pocket, or tab top offer different aesthetic effects and can be chosen based on the desired look.  Window treatments go beyond curtains and can include a variety of options such as blinds, shades, valances, and drapes. Blinds are a versatile choice that offers privacy and light control, while shades come in various styles like Roman, roller, or cellular, providing different levels of insulation and light filtration. Valances are perfect for adding a decorative touch to windows, while drapes – similar to curtains but typically made from heavier fabric – can create a luxurious and opulent look.  Consider the function of the room when choosing window treatments. For example, in bedrooms, light-blocking or blackout curtains can help create a conducive environment for sleep by reducing light and noise. In living rooms or dining rooms, window treatments can enhance the overall ambiance and aid in temperature regulation. Functional aspects such as ease of opening and closing, maintenance, and durability should also be taken into account.  To create a cohesive and visually appealing look, coordinating or contrasting window treatments with other elements in the room such as furniture, wall color, and accessories is essential. This will help tie the design elements together and create a harmonious space. Mixing and matching different textures, colors, and patterns can add depth and visual interest to the room.  In conclusion, curtains and window treatments are essential components of interior design that can transform a space by adding style, functionality, and personality. By carefully considering factors such as fabric, style, length, and function, you can choose the perfect window treatments to enhance the overall look and feel of your home. Whether you opt for simple, modern curtains or opulent drapes, the right window treatments can truly elevate the aesthetic appeal of any room.""","694"
"Krishnamurti J  Jiddu ","""Education must be shaped to meet the individual needs of the child, and not by a Government Procrustes' bed, to fit which some are dragged well-nigh asunder and others are chopped down. The capacities of the child, the line they fit him to pursue, these must guide his education. In all, the child's interest must be paramount; the true teacher exists to serve. The school must be a centre of good and joyous influences, radiating from it to the neighbourhood. Studies and games must all be turned to the building of character, to the making of the good citizen, the lover of his country. Thus dreams the boy, who is to become a teacher, of the possibilities the future may unfold. May he realise, in the strength of a noble Manhood, the pure visions of his youth, and embody a Power which shall make earth's deserts rejoice and blossom as the rose.. TO THE AND TO WHO HIM Many of the suggestions made in this little book come from my own memories of early school life; and my own experience since of the methods used in Occult training has shown me how much happier boys' lives might be made than they usually are. I have myself experienced both the right way of teaching and the wrong way, and therefore I want to help others towards the right way. I write upon the subject because it is one which is very near to the heart of my Master, and much of what I say is but an imperfect echo of what I have heard from Him. Then again, during the last two years, I have seen much of the work done in the Central Hindu College at Benares by Mr. G.S. Arundale and his devoted band of helpers. I have seen teachers glad to spend their time and energies in continual service of those whom they regard as their younger brothers. I have also watched the boys, in their turn, showing a reverence and an affectionate gratitude to their teachers that I had never thought possible. Though many people may think the ideals put forward are entirely beyond the average teacher, and cannot be put into practice in ordinary schools, I can thus point at least to one institution in which I have seen many of the suggestions made in this book actually carried out. It may be that some of them are, at present, beyond most schools; but they will be recognised and practised as soon as teachers realise them as desirable, and have a proper understanding of the importance of their office. Most of the recommendations apply, I think, to all countries, and to all religions, and are intended to sound the note of our common brotherhood, irrespective of religion or caste, race or colour. If the unity of life and the oneness of its purpose could be clearly taught to the young in schools, how much brighter would be our hopes for the future! The mutual distrust of races and nations would disappear, if the children were trained in mutual love and sympathy as members of one great family of children all over the world, instead of being taught to glory only in their own traditions and to despise those of others. True patriotism is a beautiful quality in children, for it means unselfishness of purpose and enthusiasm for great ideals; but that is false patriotism which shows itself in contempt for other nations. There are, I am told, many organisations within the various nations of the world, intended to inspire the children with a love for their country and a desire to serve her, and that is surely good; but I wonder when there will be an international organisation to give the children of all nations common ideals also, and a knowledge of the real foundation of right action, the Brotherhood of Man. I desire to thank my dear mother, Mrs. Annie Besant, for the help she has given me while I have been writing this little book, and also my dear friend, Mr. G.S. Arundale--with whom I have often talked on the subject--for many useful suggestions. J.. THE I. LOVE II. III. IV. GOOD. Self-control as to the mind. Self-control in action. Tolerance. Cheerfulness. One-pointedness. Confidence THE In At the Feet of the Master I have written down the instructions given to me by my Master in preparing me to learn how best to be useful to those around me. All who have read the book will know how inspiring the Master's words are, and how they make each person who reads them long to train himself for the service of others. I know myself how much I have been helped by the loving care of those to whom I look for guidance, and I am eager to pass on to others the help I have obtained from them. It seems to me that the Master's instructions can be universally applied. They are useful not only to those who are definitely trying to tread the path which leads to Initiation, but also to all who, while still doing the ordinary work of the world, are anxious to do their duty earnestly and unselfishly. One of the noblest forms of work is that of the teacher; let us see what light is thrown upon it by the words of the Master. I will take the four Qualifications which have been given in At the Feet of the Master, and will try to show how they can be applied to the life of the teacher and of the students, and to the relations which should exist between them. The most important Qualification in education is Love, and I will take that first. It is sad that in modern days the office of a teacher has not been regarded as on a level with other learned professions. Any one has been thought good enough to be a teacher, and as a result little honour has been paid to him. Naturally, therefore, the cleverest boys are not drawn towards that profession. But really the office of the teacher is the most sacred and the most important to the nation, because it builds the characters of the boys and girls who will be its future citizens. In olden days this office was thought so holy that only priests were teachers and the school was a part of the temple. In India the trust in the teacher was so great that the parents gave over their sons completely to him for many years, and teacher and students lived together as a family. Because this happy relation should be brought back again, I put Love first among the Qualifications which a teacher ought to have. If India is to become again the great nation which we all hope to see, this old happy relation must be re-established. I. LOVE My Master taught me that Love will enable a man to acquire all other qualities and that 'all the rest without it would never be sufficient.' Therefore no person ought to be a teacher--ought to be allowed to be a teacher--unless he has shown in his daily life that Love is the strongest quality of his nature. It may be asked: How are we to find out whether a person possesses Love to a sufficient degree to make him worthy to be a teacher? Just as a boy shows his natural capacities at an early age for one profession or another, so a particularly strong love-nature would mark a boy out as specially fitted to be an instructor. Such boys should be definitely trained for the office of the teacher just as boys are trained for other professions. Boys who are preparing for all careers live a common life in the same school, and they can only become useful to the nation as men, if their school life is happy. A young child is naturally happy, and if that happiness is allowed to go on and grow in the school, and at home, then he will become a man who will make others happy. A teacher full of love and sympathy will attract the boys and make their school life a pleasant one. My Master once said that 'children are very eager to learn and if a teacher cannot interest them and make them love their lessons, he is not fit to be a teacher and should choose another profession.' He has said also: 'Those who are mine love to teach and to serve. They long for an opportunity of service as a hungry man longs for food, and they are always watching for it. Their hearts are so full of the divine Love that it must be always overflowing in love for those around them. Only such are fit to be teachers--those to whom teaching is not only a holy and imperative duty, but also the greatest of pleasures.' A sympathetic teacher draws out all the good qualities in his pupils, and his gentleness prevents them from being afraid of him. Each boy then shows himself just as he is, and the teacher is able to see the line best suited to him and to help him to follow it. To such a teacher a boy will come with all his difficulties, knowing that he will be met with sympathy and kindness, and, instead of hiding his weaknesses, he will be glad to tell everything to one of whose loving help he is sure. The good teacher remembers his own youth, and so can feel with the boy who comes to him. My Master said: 'He who has forgotten his childhood and lost sympathy with the children is not a man who can teach them or help them.' This love of the teacher for his pupil, protecting and helping him, will bring out love from the pupil in turn, and as he looks up to his teacher this love will take the form of reverence. Reverence, beginning in this way with the boy, will grow as he grows older, and will become the habit of seeing and reverencing greatness, and so perhaps in time may lead him to the Feet of the Master. The love of the boy to the teacher will make him docile and easy to guide, and so the question of punishment will never arise. Thus one great cause of fear which at present poisons all the relations between the teacher and his pupil will vanish. Those of us who have the happiness of being pupils of the true Masters know what this relation ought to be. We know the wonderful patience, gentleness and sympathy with which They always meet us, even when we may have made mistakes or have been weak. Yet there is much more difference between Them and us than between the ordinary teacher and his pupil.""","""Individualized Child-Centered Education""","2057","""Individualized child-centered education is a teaching approach that places the student at the core of the learning process, tailoring education to meet each child's unique needs, interests, and abilities. It shifts the focus from traditional one-size-fits-all approaches to a more personalized, student-led method that empowers learners to take an active role in their educational journey. This approach recognizes that every child is different, with varying learning styles, strengths, weaknesses, and interests, and aims to create an environment where each student can thrive and reach their full potential.  At the heart of individualized child-centered education is the belief that children learn best when they are actively engaged in meaningful activities that are relevant to their lives. This approach values the whole child, taking into account not only academic achievement but also social, emotional, and physical well-being. By understanding each student's unique strengths and challenges, teachers can create customized learning experiences that address their individual needs and foster a love for learning.  One of the key principles of individualized child-centered education is differentiation. This involves adjusting the content, process, and assessment to accommodate the diverse needs of students. Teachers can differentiate instruction by providing alternative ways for students to access information, demonstrating understanding, and engaging with the material. For example, students may be given choices in how they demonstrate their knowledge, such as through presentations, projects, or written assignments, allowing them to showcase their strengths and interests.  Another important aspect of individualized child-centered education is personalized learning plans. These plans outline the student's goals, interests, learning styles, and any accommodations or modifications needed to support their learning. By involving students in the goal-setting process and regularly reviewing and adjusting the plan based on their progress, educators can provide targeted support and feedback to help students succeed.  In a child-centered classroom, the role of the teacher shifts from being a knowledge provider to a facilitator of learning. Teachers act as guides, mentors, and coaches, helping students develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and a growth mindset. They create a safe and supportive environment where students feel empowered to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from their experiences.  Technology plays a significant role in individualized child-centered education by providing students with access to personalized learning resources, adaptive software, and online platforms that support self-paced learning. Technology tools can help teachers track student progress, provide instant feedback, and differentiate instruction based on individual needs. Virtual learning environments also allow students to explore topics of interest, collaborate with peers, and engage in interactive activities that cater to their unique learning preferences.  Parents also play a crucial role in supporting individualized child-centered education by actively engaging in their child's learning journey. By partnering with teachers, sharing insights about their child's interests, strengths, and challenges, and advocating for their child's educational needs, parents can help create a cohesive support system that nurtures the whole child.  Assessment in individualized child-centered education goes beyond traditional tests and grades to include a variety of formative and summative assessment methods that provide a more holistic view of student learning. Teachers use a mix of observations, student work samples, self-assessments, and peer evaluations to measure progress, identify areas for growth, and celebrate achievements. This approach values the process of learning over the end product, focusing on mastery of skills and concepts rather than rote memorization.  In conclusion, individualized child-centered education is a student-centered approach that celebrates the unique strengths, interests, and needs of each learner. By personalizing learning experiences, fostering student agency, and creating a supportive and inclusive environment, this approach empowers students to become active participants in their education and prepares them for success in an ever-changing world. By prioritizing the whole child and embracing diversity, individualized child-centered education ensures that every student has the opportunity to reach their full potential and become lifelong learners.""","769"
"Zangwill Israel","""At the worst, we may say there are two conflicting currents of thought, as there are in the bosom of every nation, one primarily self-regarding, and the other setting towards the larger life of humanity. It may help us to understand the paradox of the junction of Israel's glory with God's, if we remember that the most inspired of mortals, those whose life is consecrated to an art, a social reform, a political redemption, are rarely able to separate the success of their mission from their own individual success or at least individual importance. Even Jesus looked forward to his twelve legions of angels and his seat at the right hand of Power. But in no other nation known to history has the balance of motives been cast so overwhelmingly on the side of idealism. An episode related by Josephus touching Pontius Pilate serves to illuminate the more famous episode in which he figures. When he brought the Roman ensigns with Csar's effigies to Jerusalem, the Jews so wearied him with their petitions to remove this defiling deification that at last he surrounded the petitioners with soldiers and menaced them with immediate death unless they ceased to pester and went home. 'But they threw themselves upon the ground and laid their necks bare and said they would take their deaths very willingly rather than the wisdom of their laws should be transgressed.' And Pilate, touched, removed the effigies. Such a story explains at once how the Jews could produce Jesus and why they could not worship him. 'God's witnesses,' 'a light of the nations,' 'a suffering servant,' 'a kingdom of priests'--the old Testament metaphors for Israel's mission are as numerous as they are noble. And the lyrics in which they occur are unparalleled in literature for their fusion of ethical passion with poetical beauty. Take, for example, the forty-second chapter of Isaiah. (I quote as in gratitude bound the accurate Jewish version of the Bible we owe to America.) Behold My servant whom I uphold; Mine elect in whom My soul delighteth; I have put My spirit upon him, He shall make the right to go forth to the nations: He shall not fail or be crushed Till he have set the right on the earth, And the isles shall wait for his teaching. Thus saith God the LORD, He that created the heavens, and stretched them forth, He that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it, He that giveth bread unto the people upon it, And spirit to them that walk therein: I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, And have taken hold of thy hand, And kept thee, and set thee for a covenant of the people, For a light of the nations; To open the blind eyes, To bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, And them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house. Never was ideal less tribal: it is still the dynamic impulse of all civilization. 'Let justice well up as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream.' 'Nation shall not lift sword against nation, neither shall there be war any more.' Nor does this mission march always with the pageantry of external triumph. 'Despised and forsaken of men,' Isaiah paints Israel. 'Yet he bore the sin of many. And made intercession for the transgressors. with his stripes we were healed.' Happily all that is best in Christendom recognizes, with Kuenen or Matthew Arnold, the grandeur of the Old Testament ideal. But that this ideal penetrated equally to our everyday liturgy is less understood of the world. 'Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, who hast chosen Israel from all peoples and given him the Law.' Here is no choice of a favourite but of a servant, and when it is added that 'from Zion shall the Law go forth' it is obvious what that servant's task is to be. 'What everlasting love hast Thou loved the house of Israel,' says the Evening Prayer. But in what does this love consist? Is it that we have been pampered, cosseted? The contrary. 'A Law, and commandments, statutes and judgments hast Thou taught us.' Before these were thundered from Sinai, the historian of the Exodus records, Israel was explicitly informed that only by obedience to them could he enjoy peculiar favour. 'Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine; and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.' A chosen people is really a choosing people. Not idly does Talmudical legend assert that the Law was offered first to all other nations and only Israel accepted the yoke. How far the discipline of the Law actually produced the Chosen People postulated in its conferment is a subtle question for pragmatists. Mr. Lucien Wolf once urged that 'the yoke of the Torah' had fashioned a racial aristocracy possessing marked biological advantages over average humanity, as well as sociological superiorities of temperance and family life. And indeed the statistics of Jewish vitality and brain-power, and even of artistic faculty, are amazing enough to invite investigation from all eugenists, biologists, and statesmen. But whether this general superiority--a superiority not inconsistent with grave failings and drawbacks--is due to the rigorous selection of a tragic history, or whether it is, as Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu maintains, the heritage of a civilization older by thousands of years than that of Europe; whether the Torah made the greatness of the people, or the people--precisely because of its greatness--made the Torah; whether we have a case of natural election or artificial election to study, it is not in any self-sufficient superiority or aim thereat that the essence of Judaism lies, but in an apostolic altruism. The old Hebrew writers indeed--when one considers the impress the Bible was destined to make on the faith, art, and imagination of the world--might well be credited with the intuition of genius in attributing to their people a quality of election. And the Jews of to-day in attributing to themselves that quality would have the ground not only of intuition but of history. Nevertheless that election is, even by Jewish orthodoxy, conceived as designed solely for world-service, for that spiritual mission for which Israel when fashioned was exiled and scattered like wind-borne seeds, and of the consummation of which his ultimate repatriation and glory will be but the symbol. It is with Alenu that every service ends--the prayer for the coming of the Kingdom of God, 'when Thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the Kingdom of the Almighty and all the children of flesh will call upon Thy name, when Thou wilt turn unto Thyself all the wicked of the earth. In that day the Lord shall be One and His name One.' Israel disappears altogether in this diurnal aspiration. IV Israel disappears, too, in whole books of the Old Testament. What has the problem of Job, the wisdom of Proverbs, or the pessimism of Ecclesiastes to do with the Jew specifically? The Psalter would scarcely have had so universal an appeal had it been essentially rooted in a race. In the magnificent cosmic poem of Psalm civ--half Whitman, half St. Francis--not only his fellow-man but all creation comes under the benediction of the Hebrew poet's mood. 'The high hills are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God. man goeth forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening.' Even in a more primitive Hebrew poet the same cosmic universalism reveals itself. To the bard of Genesis the rainbow betokens not merely a covenant between God and man but a 'covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.' That the myth of the tribalism of the Jewish God should persist in face of such passages can only be explained by the fact that He shares in the unpopularity of His people. Mr. Wells, for example, in his finely felt but intellectually incoherent book, 'God the Invisible King,' dismisses Him as a malignant and partisan Deity, jealous and pettily stringent. At most one is entitled to say with Mr. Israel Abrahams in his profound little book on 'Judaism' that 'God, in the early literature a tribal, non-moral Deity, was in the later literature a righteous ruler, who, with Amos and Hosea, loved and demanded righteousness in man,' and that there was an expansion from a national to a universal Ruler. But if 'by early literature' anybody understand simply Genesis, if he imagines that the evolutionary movement in Judaism proceeds regularly from Abraham to Isaiah, he is grossly in error. No doubt all early gods are tribal, all early religions connected with the hearth and ancestor worship, but the God of Isaiah is already in Genesis, and the tribal God has to be exhumed from practically all parts of the Bible. But even in the crudities of Genesis or Judges that have escaped editorship I cannot find Mr. Wells's 'malignant' Deity--He is really 'the invisible King.' The very first time Jehovah appears in His tribal promise to bless Abraham ends with the assurance--and it almost invariably accompanies all the repetitions of the promise--'And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.' Nay, as I pointed out in my essay on 'The Gods of Germany,' the very first words of the Bible, 'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,' strike a magnificent note of universalism, which is sustained in the derivation of all humanity from Adam, and again from Noah, with one original language. Nor is this a modern gloss, for the Talmud already deduces the interpretation. Racine's 'Esther' in the noble lines lauded by Voltaire might be almost rebuking Mr. Wells:--""","""Jewish Identity and Universalism""","2091","""Jewish Identity and Universalism  Jewish identity is a multifaceted and deeply-rooted concept that encompasses various elements, including religion, culture, ethnicity, history, and more. Throughout history, Jewish communities worldwide have grappled with the balance between maintaining a distinct identity and engaging with the broader universal values and norms of society - a concept known as universalism. This intricate interplay between Jewish particularism and universalism has been a central theme in Jewish thought and practice, shaping the identity and worldview of Jewish individuals and communities.  At the core of Jewish identity is the notion of chosenness - the belief that the Jewish people have a unique covenant with God and a special role to play in the world. This sense of chosenness has historically served as a source of strength and resilience for Jewish communities in the face of adversity and persecution. It has also contributed to the development of a strong sense of cultural and historical continuity among Jews, fostering a shared identity that transcends geographical boundaries and time.  One of the key pillars of Jewish identity is religious faith and practice. Judaism, as a monotheistic religion, provides a framework for Jewish individuals to connect with their heritage, values, and community. The observance of mitzvot (commandments), participation in communal rituals and celebrations, and study of Jewish texts are all integral components of Jewish life that serve to reinforce Jewish identity and strengthen communal bonds.  Cultural and ethnic dimensions also play a significant role in shaping Jewish identity. Jewish cultural practices, including cuisine, music, art, literature, and language, contribute to a sense of shared heritage and belonging among Jews around the world. The Yiddish language, for example, served as a unifying force among Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe, while Ladino was spoken among Sephardic Jews in the Mediterranean region. These cultural expressions not only enrich Jewish identity but also serve as a connection to a rich and diverse heritage.  In addition to religion and culture, the historical experiences of persecution, migration, and displacement have profoundly influenced Jewish identity. The collective memory of events such as the Holocaust, pogroms, expulsions, and the establishment of the State of Israel has shaped the worldview of many Jews and reinforced a sense of solidarity and resilience within the community. These historical traumas serve as a reminder of the importance of preserving Jewish identity and ensuring the continuity of Jewish life and culture.  The tension between Jewish particularism and universalism is a central theme in Jewish thought and identity. While Jewish tradition emphasizes the unique role and responsibilities of the Jewish people, it also upholds the values of justice, compassion, and ethical behavior that are considered universal ideals. The concept of tikkun olam (repairing the world) embodies the belief that Jews have a moral obligation to work towards social justice, equality, and peace for all people, not just within the Jewish community.  The relationship between Jewish identity and universalism is further explored in the concept of Jewish ethics and morality. Central to Jewish thought is the belief in the inherent dignity and worth of every human being, reflecting the idea that all individuals are created in the image of God. This universalistic approach to ethics underscores the interconnectedness of all humanity and the need for compassion, empathy, and justice towards others, regardless of their background or beliefs.  Moreover, Jewish tradition recognizes the importance of engaging with the broader world and contributing to the betterment of society. Jews have a long history of involvement in social justice movements, philanthropy, education, and other endeavors aimed at improving the lives of others. This commitment to universal values and social responsibility resonates with the concept of universalism and reflects a deep-seated belief in the shared humanity of all people.  The tension between particularism and universalism is also evident in the relationship between Jewish communities and the larger world. Throughout history, Jews have faced challenges in navigating their dual identity as members of a distinct religious and cultural group and as citizens of diverse societies. Assimilation, acculturation, and integration have all posed challenges to maintaining a strong sense of Jewish identity while engaging with the broader cultural, social, and political landscape.  Despite these challenges, Jewish identity has continued to evolve and adapt over time, incorporating elements of both particularism and universalism. The richness and diversity of Jewish identity are reflected in the myriad ways that Jews express their cultural, religious, and historical heritage, while also embracing the values of tolerance, diversity, and inclusion that are central to a more universalistic worldview.  In conclusion, Jewish identity is a complex and dynamic construct that encompasses religious, cultural, historical, and ethical dimensions. The interplay between Jewish particularism and universalism adds depth and richness to Jewish identity, highlighting the diverse and interconnected nature of Jewish thought and practice. By navigating the delicate balance between maintaining a distinct identity and engaging with universal values, Jewish individuals and communities can continue to contribute to a more just, compassionate, and inclusive world for all.""","990"

IV ', ACT AND ' (Message to the American People, April 5/8, 917) MY,--The entrance of our own beloved country into the grim and terrible war for democracy and human rights which has shaken the world creates so many problems of national life and action which call for immediate consideration and settlement that I hope you will permit me to address to you a few words of earnest counsel and appeal with regard to them. We are rapidly putting our navy upon an effective war footing and are about to create and equip a great army, but these are the simplest parts of the great task to which we have addressed ourselves. There is not a single selfish element, so far as I can see, in the cause we are fighting for. We are fighting for what we believe and wish to be the rights of mankind and for the future peace and security of the world. To do this great thing worthily and successfully we must devote ourselves to the service without regard to profit or material advantage and with an energy and intelligence that will rise to the level of the enterprise itself. We must realize to the full how great the task is and how many things, how many kinds and elements of capacity and service and self-sacrifice it involves. WHAT WE MUST DO These, then, are the things we must do, and do well, besides fighting--the things without which mere fighting would be fruitless: We must supply abundant food for ourselves and for our armies and our seamen, not only, but also for a large part of the nations with whom we have now made common cause, in whose support and by whose sides we shall be fighting. We must supply ships by the hundreds out of our shipyards to carry to the other side of the sea, submarines or no submarines, what will every day be needed there, and abundant materials out of our fields and our mines and our factories with which not only to clothe and equip our own forces on land and sea, but also to clothe and support our people, for whom the gallant fellows under arms can no longer work; to help clothe and equip the armies with which we are co-operating in Europe, and to keep the looms and manufactories there in raw material; coal to keep the fires going in ships at sea and in the furnaces of hundreds of factories across the sea; steel out of which to make arms and ammunition both here and there; rails for wornout railways back of the fighting fronts; locomotives and rolling-stock to take the place of those every day going to pieces; mules, horses, cattle for labor and for military service; everything with which the people of England and France and Italy and Russia have usually supplied themselves, but cannot now afford the men, the materials or the machinery to make. It is evident to every thinking man that our industries, on the farms, in the shipyards, in the mines, in the factories, must be made more prolific and more efficient than ever, and that they must be more economically managed and better adapted to the particular requirements of our task than they have been; and what I want to say is that the men and the women who devote their thought and their energy to these things will be serving the country and conducting the fight for peace and freedom just as truly and just as effectively as the men on the battle-field or in the trenches. The industrial forces of the country, men and women alike, will be a great national, a great international, service army--a notable and honored host engaged in the service of the nation and the world, the efficient friends and saviors of free men everywhere. Thousands, nay, hundreds of thousands, of men otherwise liable to military service will of right and of necessity be excused from that service and assigned to the fundamental sustaining work of the fields and factories and mines, and they will be as much part of the great patriotic forces of the nation as the men under fire. I take the liberty, therefore, of addressing this word to the farmers of the country and to all who work on the farms: The supreme need of our own nation and of the nations with which we are co-operating is an abundance of supplies, and especially of foodstuffs. The importance of an adequate food-supply, especially for the present year, is superlative. Without abundant food, alike for the armies and the peoples now at war, the whole great enterprise upon which we have embarked will break down and fail.""","""Alien enemies and national security""","1979","""Alien enemies pose a unique and complex challenge to national security, transcending traditional borders and capabilities. In an era where global interconnectedness has blurred distinctions between foreign and domestic threats, the notion of alien enemies encompasses not only extraterrestrial entities but also unconventional adversaries that operate outside the bounds of conventional warfare. Understanding and addressing this multifaceted issue is essential for safeguarding a nation's interests and ensuring the safety of its citizens.  One of the key characteristics of alien enemies is their elusive nature. Unlike conventional adversaries with identifiable territories and affiliations, alien enemies operate in clandestine networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in cyberspace, financial systems, and critical infrastructure. Their ability to infiltrate and disrupt without a clear trace complicates traditional defense mechanisms, necessitating a proactive and adaptive approach to national security.  The emergence of cyber warfare as a potent tool for alien enemies has reshaped the geopolitical landscape. State-sponsored hackers, criminal syndicates, and ideological groups leverage digital platforms to launch attacks on government agencies, businesses, and individuals, causing widespread chaos and destabilization. The sophisticated tactics employed by these actors underscore the need for robust cybersecurity measures that can detect, deter, and respond to evolving threats in real-time.  Furthermore, the proliferation of disinformation campaigns by alien enemies poses a significant challenge to democratic institutions and societal cohesion. By manipulating public opinion, spreading falsehoods, and sowing discord, these actors seek to undermine trust in institutions, erode social fabric, and ultimately weaken a nation from within. Combatting this insidious threat requires a concerted effort to enhance media literacy, promote digital resilience, and hold purveyors of misinformation accountable.  In the realm of national defense, the rise of hybrid warfare tactics employed by alien enemies has necessitated a holistic approach that integrates military, intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic tools. The blurring of lines between conventional and unconventional threats demands a flexible and agile response that can adapt to asymmetrical challenges posed by state and non-state actors alike. Collaboration with international partners, sharing of intelligence, and coordination of efforts are essential in countering the diverse array of threats posed by alien enemies.  Moreover, the weaponization of emerging technologies by alien enemies introduces new frontiers of vulnerability that must be addressed to safeguard national security. From autonomous drones and artificial intelligence to biotechnological advancements, the potential for misuse by malicious actors poses a significant risk to critical infrastructure, strategic assets, and civilian populations. Developing robust regulatory frameworks, establishing ethical guidelines, and fostering innovation in defensive technologies are imperative to stay ahead of the curve in this technological arms race.  In conclusion, the concept of alien enemies in the context of national security transcends traditional notions of warfare and defense. As the threat landscape continues to evolve in an increasingly interconnected world, policymakers, security experts, and the public must remain vigilant, adaptive, and collaborative in addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by alien enemies. By leveraging a combination of resilience, innovation, and international cooperation, nations can enhance their capacity to mitigate risks, protect their interests, and preserve peace and stability in an ever-changing geopolitical environment.""","613"
"Fénelon François de Salignac de La Mothe ","""To speak at this rate is building castles in the air, and imposing vain imaginations on the belief of others; for who has told these philosophers that the mass of matter has ever the same motion in its totality? Who has made the experiment of it? Have they the assurance to bestow the name of philosophy upon a rash fiction which takes for granted what they never can make out? Is there no more to do than to suppose whatever one pleases in order to elude the most simple and most constant truths? What authority have they to suppose that all bodies incessantly move, either sensibly or insensibly? When I see a stone that appears motionless, how will they prove to me that there is no atom in that stone but what is actually in motion? Will they ever impose upon me bare suppositions, without any semblance of truth, for decisive proofs? SECT.. It is Falsely supposed that Motion is Essential to Bodies. However, let us go a step further, and, out of excessive complaisance, suppose that all the bodies in Nature are actually in motion. Does it follow from thence that motion is essential to every particle of matter? Besides, if all bodies have not an equal degree of motion; if some move sensibly, and more swiftly than others; if the same body may move sometimes quicker and sometimes slower; if a body that moves communicates its motion to the neighbouring body that was at rest, or in such inferior motion that it was insensible--it must be confessed that a mode or modification which sometimes increases, and at other times decreases, in bodies is not essential to them. What is essential to a being is ever the same in it. Neither the motion that varies in bodies, and which, after having increased, slackens and decreases to such a degree as to appear absolutely extinct and annihilated; nor the motion that is lost, that is communicated, that passes from one body to another as a foreign thing--can belong to the essence of bodies. And, therefore, I may conclude that bodies are perfect in their essence without ascribing to them any motion. If they have no motion in their essence, they have it only by accident; and if they have it only by accident, we must trace up that accident to its true cause. Bodies must either bestow motion on themselves, or receive it from some other being. It is evident they do not bestow it on themselves, for no being can give what it has not in itself. And we are sensible that a body at rest ever remains motionless, unless some neighbouring body happens to shake it. It is certain, therefore, that no body moves by itself, and is only moved by some other body that communicates its motion to it. But how comes it to pass that a body can move another? What is the reason that a ball which a man causes to roll on a smooth touch another without moving it? Why was it not possible that motion should not ever communicate itself from one body to another? In such a case a ball in motion would stop near another at their meeting, and yet never shake it. SECT. LXXX. The Rules of Motion, which the Epicureans suppose do not render it essential to Bodies. I may be answered that, according to the rules of motion among bodies, one ought to shake or move another. But where are those laws of motion written and recorded? Who both made them and rendered them so inviolable? They do not belong to the essence of bodies, for we can conceive bodies at rest; and we even conceive bodies that would not communicate their motion to others unless these rules, with whose original we are unacquainted, subjected them to it. Whence comes this, as it were, arbitrary government of motion over all bodies? Whence proceed laws so ingenious, so just, so well adapted one to the other, that the least alteration of or deviation from which would, on a sudden, overturn and destroy all the excellent order we admire in the universe? A body being entirely distinct from another, is in its nature absolutely independent from it in all respects. Whence it follows that it should not receive anything from it, or be susceptible of any of its impressions. The modifications of a body imply no necessary reason to modify in the same manner another body, whose being is entirely independent from the being of the first. It is to no purpose to allege that the most solid and most heavy bodies carry or force away those that are less big and less solid; and that, according to this rule, a great leaden ball ought to move a great ball of ivory. We do not speak of the fact; we only inquire into the cause of it. The fact is certain, and therefore the cause ought likewise to be certain and precise. Let us look for it without any manner of prepossession or prejudice. What is the reason that a great body carries off a little one? The thing might as naturally happen quite otherwise; for it might as well happen that the most solid body should never move any other body--that is to say, motion might be incommunicable. Nothing but custom obliges us to suppose that Nature ought to act as it does. SECT.. To give a satisfactory Account of Motion we must recur to the First Mover. Moreover, it has been proved that matter cannot be either infinite or eternal; and, therefore, there must be supposed both a first atom (by which motion must have begun at a precise moment), and a first concourse of atoms (that must have formed the first combination). Now, I ask what mover gave motion to that first atom, and first set the great machine of the universe a-going? It is not possible to elude this home question by an endless circle, for this question, lying within a finite circumference, must have an end at last; and so we must find the first atom in motion, and the first moment of that first motion, together with the first mover, whose hand made that first impression. SECT.. No Law of Motion has its Foundation in the Essence of the Body; and most of those Laws are Arbitrary. Among the laws of motion we must look upon all those as arbitrary which we cannot account for by the very essence of bodies. We have already made out that no motion is essential to any body. Wherefore all those laws which are supposed to be eternal and immutable are, on the contrary, arbitrary, accidental, and made without cogent necessity; for there is none of them that can be accounted for by the essence of bodies. If there were any law of motion essential to bodies, it would undoubtedly be that by which bodies of less bulk and less solid are moved by such as have more bulk and solidity. And yet we have seen that that very law is not to be accounted for by the essence of bodies. There is another which might also seem very natural--that, I mean, by which bodies ever move rather in a direct than a crooked line, unless their motion be otherwise determined by the meeting of other bodies. But even this rule has no foundation in the essence of matter. Motion is so very accidental, and super-added to the nature of bodies, that we do not find in this nature of bodies any primitive or immutable law by which they ought to move at all, much less to move according to certain rules. In the same manner as bodies might have existed, and yet have never either been in motion or communicated motion one to another, so they might never have moved but in a circular line, and this motion might have been as natural to them as the motion in a direct line. Now, who is it that pitched upon either of these two laws equally possible? What is not determined by the essence of bodies can have been determined by no other but Him who gave bodies the motion they had not in their own essence. Besides, this motion in a direct line might have been upwards or downwards, from right to left, or from left to right, or in a diagonal line. Now, who is it that determined which way the straight line should go? SECT.. The Epicureans can draw no Consequence from all their Suppositions, although the same should be granted them. Let us still attend the Epicureans even in their most fabulous suppositions, and carry on the fiction to the last degree of complaisance. Let us admit motion in the essence of bodies, and suppose, as they do, that motion in a direct line is also essential to all atoms. Let us bestow upon atoms both a will and an understanding, as poets did on rocks and rivers. And let us allow them likewise to choose which way they will begin their straight line. Now, what advantage will these philosophers draw from all I have granted them, contrary to all evidence? In the first place, all atoms must have been in motion from all eternity; secondly, they must all have had an equal motion; thirdly, they must all have moved in a direct line; fourthly, they must all have moved by an immutable and essential law. I am still willing to gratify our adversaries, so far as to suppose that those atoms are of different figures, for I will allow them to take for granted what they should be obliged to prove, and for which they have not so much as the shadow of a proof. One can never grant too much to men who never can draw any consequence from what is granted them; for the more absurdities are allowed them, the sooner they are caught by their own principles. SECT.. Atoms cannot make any Compound by the Motion the Epicureans assign them. These atoms of so many odd figures--some round, some crooked, others triangular, &c.--are by their essence obliged always to move in a straight line, without ever deviating or bending to the right or to the left; wherefore they never can hook one another, or make together any compound.""","""Nature of Motion and Matter""","2018","""Motion and matter are fundamental concepts in the realm of physics, offering insights into the behavior and interactions of the physical world. Understanding the nature of motion and matter helps us make sense of the universe at various scales, from the smallest particles to the grandest celestial bodies. This exploration provides a glimpse into the intricate dance of entities in motion and the properties that underlie their behaviors.  At the core of the concept of motion lies the understanding that objects change their position over time. Whether an object is stationary or in motion, its state can be described in terms of speed, velocity, and acceleration. Speed refers to how fast an object is moving, while velocity indicates both speed and direction. Acceleration, on the other hand, describes the rate at which an object's velocity changes.  Motion can be classified into different types based on its characteristics. Rectilinear motion occurs in a straight line, while curvilinear motion involves a curved path. Circular motion describes an object moving along a circular trajectory, experiencing centripetal acceleration that keeps it in its circular path. Understanding these types of motion is crucial for predicting and analyzing the behavior of objects in diverse scenarios, from everyday movements to complex orbits in space.  The study of matter delves into the composition, properties, and behavior of substances that make up the physical world. Matter exists in various states—solid, liquid, gas, and plasma—each with distinct characteristics dictated by the arrangement and movement of particles within them. The behavior of matter is governed by principles of classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics, offering a comprehensive framework to comprehend the physical phenomena observed in nature.  In classical mechanics, matter is treated as a particle with mass and volume, following Newton's laws of motion. These laws elucidate how forces interact with objects to induce changes in their motion. Newton's first law states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force. The second law establishes the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, while the third law posits that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  On a subatomic scale, quantum mechanics explores the behavior of matter at the level of particles such as electrons, protons, and neutrons. Quantum theory highlights the wave-particle duality of matter, where particles exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties. Concepts like superposition and entanglement challenge our classical intuitions but provide a deeper understanding of the underlying nature of matter and its interactions.  Thermodynamics, a branch of physics concerned with heat and temperature, studies the transfer of energy within systems of matter. The laws of thermodynamics govern the behavior of matter undergoing thermal processes, defining concepts like entropy, heat transfer, and energy conservation. Understanding how matter responds to changes in temperature and pressure is crucial for various applications, including energy production, climate modeling, and material science.  In the cosmic theater, celestial bodies exhibit motion and interactions governed by gravitational forces. Planets orbit stars, moons revolve around planets, and galaxies move through the vast expanse of space. The study of astrophysics explores the behavior of matter and motion on cosmic scales, unveiling the mysteries of black holes, supernovae, and the expanding universe.  In conclusion, the nature of motion and matter forms the foundation of our understanding of the physical world. Through the study of motion, we unravel the dynamics of objects in motion, from the microscopic realm of particles to the macroscopic scale of galaxies. Concurrently, the exploration of matter reveals the intricacies of substance and its properties, shedding light on the behavior of materials in various states and environments. Embracing the complexities of motion and matter allows us to appreciate the beauty and order that govern the universe in all its diversity and grandeur.""","758"
"Morris William O Connor","""The Pale had been restricted within ever-narrowing bounds; generations of colonising 'Englishry' had entered the country, and had left it in angry despair; the 'Irishry' had encroached on their conqueror's domain; the work of Strongbow and Fitzstephen appeared to be undone. Especially it was observed that nothing like a middle class, even then the best element in the social life of England, had been able to develop itself in Ireland, and that the humbler classes were always in a state of wretchedness, ground down by exaction, and exposed to incessant wrongs of all kinds. 'What common folk of all the world'--these were the words of a State paper of the age--'is so poor, so feeble, so evil be seen in town and field, so greatly oppressed and trodden underfoot, fares so evil, with so great misery, and with so wretched a life, as the common folk of Ireland?' Henry VII. strengthened the authority of the Crown in Ireland; the Viceroyalty of Poynings marks an epoch in her chequered annals; but the conduct of the king was shifting and weak; the land fell under the control of the great House of Kildare; the Irishry were driven back, but in no sense subdued. Surrey, the victor of Flodden, intreated Henry VIII. to make the country his own by sheer force of arms; but his master refused in striking language; and proposed a scheme for bringing Ireland under the control of the Monarchy, for encouraging civilisation and promoting order, the wisest that has ever suggested itself to a British statesman. He made several of 'the degenerate' Norman noblesse peers; he extended the same dignity to several Irish chiefs; he assembled representatives of Ireland in a Parliament composed of both races; he appointed commissioners to go through the country and to punish crime; above all--and this deserves special notice--he tried to conciliate the Celtic community by bringing their usages within the cognisance of the law, and giving them effectual legal sanction; and he condemned the attempts being already made to force laws on them peculiar to England. Had this enlightened policy been steadily pursued, the history of Ireland would have run a wholly different course; but destiny, that has played so sinister a part in Irish affairs, interfered to thwart the admirable designs of the king. The great Geraldine rebellion broke out, supported by irregular Celtic risings; from this time forward, during five generations of man, the era of cruel but intermittent conquest, accompanied by wholesale confiscation, set in. The powerful tribe of the O'Connors of Offaly, closely associated with the fallen House of Kildare, was the first to feel the weight of the arm of England; its territories were forcibly overrun and annexed, given the name of the King's and the Queen's Counties, and peopled with a colony of settlers from England. Celtic Ireland ere long was brought into the conflict between Elizabeth and Philip II., the representatives of the faiths that were dividing Christendom; the princely chief, Shane O'Neill, fell a victim to the English conquerors, though their quarrel with him was not wholly one of seeking the assistance of a foreign enemy; his vast domains were, also, in part forfeited, in part handed over to a puppet of English power. The frightful Desmond rebellion followed; it was directly encouraged by the Pope and by Spain; after a protracted struggle approaching a real civil war, the immense lordships of the great Geraldine House were confiscated, and granted to a colony of English blood. Tyrone, the real successor of his kinsman, Shane O'Neill, a soldier and statesman of no ordinary parts, seeing, as he bitterly said, that his 'lands were marked down by the spoiler,' endeavoured, not without partial success, to combine a great Irish League against England; he entered into an alliance with Spain; a Spanish army landed on the southern coast of Munster; after a long and sanguinary contest, Tyrone yielded, but his resistance had been so formidable that he was allowed to retain his possessions. The subjugation of a large part of Ireland, in the Elizabethan wars, was marked by incidents of a most atrocious character. The Government had no regular army to act in the field; it was compelled largely to rely on armed levies of the Englishry, and on bodies of the Irishry attached to the conqueror's standards; for in this, as in nearly all instances throughout their history, the Irish Celts were at feud with each other; Celtic Ireland was a house divided against itself. The queen, it has been written, 'ruled over blood and ashes,' when Mountjoy sheathed his victorious sword; the memory of this period still lives in Irish tradition. A season of exhaustion and repose ensued after James I. had ascended the throne; but the time, in the phrase of Tacitus, had an evil aspect in peace itself. The Pale had long before this been effaced; conquest and confiscation had spread over nearly the whole island; the domination of England was felt almost everywhere. As the result, the whole of Ireland was made shire land; the old Celtic land system, which still widely prevailed, was swept away by decisions of the Anglican Courts of Justice; it was declared to be 'a lewd and not law-worthy thing;' all the Irish land was subjected to English modes of tenure; they were imposed on a people which detested these gifts of the stranger; innumerable tribal rights were destroyed. Ere long the work of confiscation began again; the domains of Tyrone and of his kinsman O'Donnell were pronounced forfeited for reasons that have never been ascertained; the Crown was placed in possession of nearly six counties of Ulster. Up to this time the settlements of English colonists, which had been made in Ireland by Tudor conquest, had failed; the colonists had been almost lost in the midst of the Irishry, who hemmed them around. This immense confiscation was, however, in part successful; it was carried out on comparatively enlightened principles; it has produced the famous Plantation of Ulster; and this, with other settlements in the counties of Antrim and Down, has established, in a large part of the northern province of Ireland, a hardy and thriving community, in the main, of Scottish blood. Confiscation, nevertheless, did not stop here; 'the ravages of war,' in Burke's language, were 'carried on amidst seeming peace;' enormous tracts were torn from their former owners on pretexts usually of the flimsiest kind, and were flung to Court favourites, to jobbing speculators, to greedy adventurers of the baser sort. By this time three-fourths probably of the soil of Ireland had passed into the hands of a new race of possessors; the descendants of Anglo-Norman nobles and of the Celtic princes had been sufferers well-nigh in the same proportion. At last Strafford marked out the whole province of Connaught, for what has been called 'his majestic rapine;' this and other innumerable acts of spoliation and wrong unquestionably were the paramount cause of the great Celtic rising of 641. Another and soon to be a most potent element of evils and troubles had already begun to make its sinister presence felt in Ireland. In the great religious schism of the sixteenth century, England had become Protestant, Ireland had remained Catholic, and each had taken opposite sides in the conflict that followed; though the Elizabethan wars were rather struggles of race than of faith. But as conquest and confiscation progressed in Ireland, the Anglican Church, a scion of the Norman Church of the Pale, was erected on the ruins of its Celtic Catholic rival; the land more and more became possessed by settlers alien in creed from the old owners, and from the vanquished children of the soil; and harsh laws had begun to deepen the distinctions between them. Nevertheless, though its signs had in some measure appeared, the era of Protestant ascendency and Catholic subjection had not been developed in Ireland, as yet, in its worst aspects. The wild Celtic rising of 641 was followed by a rising of the old Englishry of the Pale--the descendants of the first Anglo-Norman settlers; both movements were probably encouraged from France; though widely different, they ran into each other. The great Civil War was now running its course in England; Ireland, for the most part, took the side of the king; the majority of Englishmen were certainly on the side of the Parliament. I cannot retrace the scenes of the contest in Ireland; after a fierce and protracted struggle, in which an envoy of the Pope became the representative of an ill-united Irish League; in which Preston and Ormond led the forces of the Pale, and Owen Roe O'Neill was at the head of the Irish Celts,--the whole island was subjugated by the sword of Cromwell, as it never had been subjugated before. Drogheda and Wexford are names of woe in the annals of Ireland; but the conquest of the Protector, ruthless as it was, was not so cruel as that of the Elizabethan soldiers; if deeply stained with blood, it was rapid and completely decisive. The colony in Ulster had begun to flourish; Cromwell designed a scheme for the colonisation of the vanquished country more thorough and extensive than any which had been designed before. Three-fourths of Ireland had been in arms against the Parliament; that assembly had made grants by anticipation of Irish forfeited lands to 'adventurers' who had advanced it moneys; an opportunity for immense confiscations had arisen; the Protector was not slow to take advantage of it; his Puritan fanaticism, his hatred of the Irish people, especially of its 'idolatrous Papists,' his strong English and religious sympathies, united to confirm him in his purpose.""","""Irish colonization and conflict history""","2067","""Irish colonization and conflict history is a complex and layered narrative that spans centuries, marked by themes of conquest, resistance, identity, and reconciliation. The history of Ireland is deeply intertwined with colonization, beginning with the arrival of the Celts in the 4th century BCE, followed by the Norse Vikings in the 9th century and the Anglo-Norman invasion in the 12th century. However, it was the English colonization of Ireland in the 16th and 17th centuries that significantly shaped the country's history and continues to impact its culture and politics to this day.  The Tudor conquest of Ireland in the 16th century marked the beginning of a long and tumultuous period of English domination over the island. The reign of Henry VIII saw the establishment of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1542, culminating in the Plantation of Ireland – a policy of displacing Irish Catholics and replacing them with Protestant settlers from England and Scotland. This systematic colonization aimed to assert English control over the native Irish population and consolidate power in the hands of the English crown and Protestant loyalists.  The 17th century witnessed further colonization efforts, most notably during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the mid-1600s. Oliver Cromwell's brutal campaign resulted in the massacre of thousands of Irish civilians, widespread land confiscations, and the displacement of the Catholic population. This period of intense colonization and repression solidified the divide between the Irish Catholic majority and the Protestant minority, laying the groundwork for centuries of sectarian conflict and tension.  The 18th and 19th centuries saw a continued struggle for Irish self-determination and independence from British rule. The United Irishmen's rebellion of 1798, led by figures like Wolfe Tone, sought to unite Irish Catholics and Protestants in a common cause against British oppression. Although the rebellion was ultimately crushed by the British, it laid the foundation for later movements advocating for Irish independence, such as the Young Irelanders and the Fenian Brotherhood.  The 19th century also witnessed the devastating impact of the Great Famine, a period of widespread starvation and emigration caused by a potato blight. The response of the British government to the famine, characterized by indifference and inadequate relief efforts, further deepened resentment among the Irish population towards their colonial rulers. The famine's legacy continues to shape Ireland's collective memory and remains a poignant symbol of British neglect and Irish suffering.  The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a resurgence of Irish nationalism and the fight for independence. The Home Rule movement, led by figures like Charles Stewart Parnell, sought to achieve self-government for Ireland within the British Empire. However, the polarizing issue of Irish Home Rule led to divisions within Irish society, particularly between unionists in the north-east who wished to remain part of the United Kingdom and nationalists who sought an independent Ireland.  The Easter Rising of 1916, a seminal event in Irish history, saw a group of Irish republicans proclaim an independent Irish Republic and take up arms against British forces in Dublin. Although the Rising was quickly suppressed by the British military, it galvanized support for Irish independence and paved the way for the War of Independence (1919-1921) led by the guerrilla tactics of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) against British forces.  The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which followed the War of Independence, led to the partition of Ireland and the establishment of the Irish Free State in the south while the six counties of Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. The Treaty sparked a bitter civil war between pro-Treaty forces supporting the agreement and anti-Treaty republicans who rejected it in favor of a fully independent Irish Republic. The civil war left a lasting scar on Irish society, deepening divisions between pro- and anti-Treaty factions.  The unresolved question of Ireland's political status continued to simmer throughout the 20th century, manifesting in the Troubles – a period of conflict in Northern Ireland characterized by sectarian violence, bombings, and political deadlock. The Troubles, which lasted from the late 1960s to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, pitted republican paramilitaries like the Provisional IRA against loyalist groups and the British military, resulting in thousands of deaths and a legacy of mistrust and division in the region.  The Good Friday Agreement, a landmark peace accord signed in 1998, brought an end to the violence of the Troubles and established a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. The agreement sought to address long-standing grievances, promote reconciliation, and lay the groundwork for a more stable and inclusive society in Northern Ireland. While the Good Friday Agreement represented a significant milestone in the peace process, challenges remain in fully implementing its provisions and addressing the legacy of conflict and division.  In conclusion, the history of Irish colonization and conflict is a testament to the resilience, struggle, and perseverance of the Irish people in the face of centuries of oppression and division. From the early days of colonization to the present-day efforts towards peace and reconciliation, the story of Ireland is a complex tapestry of triumphs and tragedies, hope and heartbreak. By understanding and reckoning with this shared past, Ireland continues to navigate its path towards a more inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous future for all its citizens.""","1070"
"Curtler W H R  William Henry Ricketts ","""Sheep in the damp climate of England have always been subject to rot, and in 735/8 there was, according to Ellis, the most general rot in the memory of man owing to a very wet season; and, as in the disastrous year of 879, which must be fresh in many farmers' memories, other animals, deer, hares, and rabbits, were affected also; and the dead bodies of rotten sheep were so numerous in road and field that the stench was offensive to every one. Another bad outbreak occurred in 747. It is well known that farmers are always grumblers, probably with an eye to the rent; but even in these much praised times they apparently made small profits. The west country farmer quoted before, who had been fifty years on the same estate, and writes with the stamp of sincerity, admits in 737 that 'with all the skill and diligence in the world he can hardly keep the cart upon the wheels. Wool had gone down, wheat didn't pay and graziers were doing badly; tho' formerly our cattle and wool was always a sure card'. He says that the profits of grazing were reckoned at one-third of the improvement that ensued from the grazing, but the grazier was not now getting this. He attributed much of the distress, however, to the extravagance of the times. Landlords, including his own, preferred London to the country, and spent their money there. How different was the behaviour of his landlord's grandfather. 'Many a time would his worship send for me to go a-hunting or shooting with him; often would he take me with him on his visits and would introduce me as his friend. The country gentlewoman and the parson's wife, that used to stitch for themselves, are now so hurried with dressings and visits and other attractions that they hire an Abigail to do it.' He thought, too, the labourers were getting too high wages; 'they are so puffed up by our provender as to offer us their heels and threaten on any occasion to leave us to do our work ourselves.' One would like to hear the labourers' opinion on this point, but they were dumb. In spite of higher wages the young men and young women flocked to the cities, and those who remain were lazy and extravagant, even the country wenches contending about 'double caps, huge petticoats, clock stockings, and other trumpery'. The bounty now paid on the export of wheat was naturally resented by the common people, as it raised the price of their bread. In 737 a load belonging to Farmer Waters of Burford, travelling along the road to Redbridge for exportation, was stopped near White parish by a crowd of people who knocked down the leading horse, broke the wagon in pieces, cut the sacks, and strewed about the corn, with threats that they would do the like to all who sold wheat to export. While England was paying farmers to export wheat she was also importing, though in plentiful years importers had a very bad time. In 730 there were lying at Liverpool 3,00 imported corn, unsaleable owing to the great crop in England. The year 740 was distinguished by one of the severest winters on record. From January to February the thermometer seldom reached 2, and the cold was so intense that hens and ducks, even cattle in their stalls died of it, trees were split asunder, crows and other birds fell to the ground frozen in their flight. This extraordinary winter was followed by a cold and late spring; no verdure had appeared by May; in July it was still cold, and thousands of acres of turnips rotted in the ground. Among minor misfortunes may be noticed the swarms of grasshoppers who devastated the pastures near Bristol at the end of August 742, and the swarms of locusts who came to England in 748 and consumed the vegetables. The cattle plague of 745/8 was so severe that owing to the scarcity of stock great quantities of grass land were ploughed up, which helped to account for the fact that in 75/80 the export of corn from England reached its maximum; though the main cause of this was the long series of excellent seasons that set in after 740. The cattle plague also raged in 75/84 in spite of an Order in Council that all infected cattle should be shot and buried ft. deep, and pitch, tar, rosin, and gunpowder burnt where infected cattle had died, and cow-houses washed with vinegar and water. Such were the sanitary precautions of the time. In 75/86 came another bad year, corn was so scarce that there were many riots; the king expressed to Parliament his concern at the suffering of the poor, and the export of corn was temporarily prohibited. The fluctuations in price are remarkable: in 75/86, before the deficiency of the harvest was realized, wheat was 2s. and it went up at the following rate: Jan., 75/87, 9s.; Feb., 1s.; March, 4s.; April, 4s.; June, 2s. About the middle of the century, if we may judge from the Compleat Cyderman written in 75/84 by experienced hands living in Devon, Cornwall, Herefordshire, and elsewhere, fruit-growing received an amount of attention which diminished greatly in after years. The authors fully realized that an orchard under tillage causes apple trees to grow as fast again as under grass, and this was well understood and practised in Kent, where crops of corn were grown between the trees. A Devonshire 'cyderist' urged that orchards should be well sheltered from the east winds, which 'bring over the narrow sea swarms of imperceptible eggs, or insects in the air, from the vast tracts of Tartarian and other lands, from which proceeded infinite numbers of lice, flies, bugs, caterpillars, cobwebs, &c.' The best protection was a screen of trees, and the best tree for the purpose, a perry pear tree. In the hard frosts of 709, 716, and 740 great numbers of fruit and other trees had been destroyed. In Devon what was called the 'Southams method' was used for top-dressing the roots of old apple trees, which was done in November with soil from the roads and ditches, or lime or chalk, laid on furze sometimes, inches thick, for or ft. all round the trees. Great attention was paid there to keeping the heads of fruit trees in good order, so that branches did not interfere with each other, and the heads were made to spread as much as possible. Many of the trees were grown with the first branches commencing ft. in. from the ground. It was claimed that Devon excelled all other parts of England in the management of fruit trees, a reputation that was not maintained, according to the works of half a century later. The best cider apple In the county then was the White-sour, white in colour, of a middling size, and early ripe; other good ones were the 'Deux-Anns, Jersey, French Longtail, Royal Wilding, Culvering, Russet, Holland Pippin, and Cowley Crab.' In Herefordshire it was the custom to open the earth about the roots of the apple trees and lay them bare and exposed for the 'twelve days of the Christmas holidays', that the wind might loosen them. Then they were covered with a compost of dung, mould, and a little lime. 'The best way' to plant was to take off the turf and lay it by itself, then the next earth or virgin mould, to be laid also by itself. Next put horse litter over the bottom of the hole with some of the virgin mould on that, on which place the tree, scattering some more virgin mould over the roots, then spread some old horse-dung over this and upon that the turf, leaving it in a basin shape. The ground between the trees in Devonshire in young orchards was first planted with cabbage plants, next year with potatoes, next with beans, and so on until the heads of the trees became large enough, when the land was allowed to return to pasture, a proceeding which was quite contrary to their previously quoted assertion that tillage was best for fruit trees. The cider-makers were quite convinced, as many are to-day, that rotten apples were invaluable for cider, and the lady who was famous for the best cider in the county never allowed one to be thrown away. A generation later than this Marshall noted that in Herefordshire the management of orchards and their produce was far from being well understood, though 'it has ever borne the name of the first cider county'. All the old fruits were lost or declining in quality, the famous Red Streak Apple was given up and the Squash Pear no longer made to flourish. As for prices, in 707 apples were selling at Liverpool for s. d. a bushel, a very good price if we allow for the difference in the value of money, but prices then were entirely dependent on the English seasons; no foreign apples were imported, and a night's frost would treble prices in a day. In 742 at Aspall Hall, Suffolk, apples, apparently for cider, were 0d. a bushel, in 745/8 s. a bushel, in 746 only d., and in 747 cider there was worth d. a gallon. At the end of the century, in 'the great hit' of 784, common apples were less than d. a bushel, the best about s. in 786 the price was twice as high, owing to a short crop. Incidentally there is mentioned in the Compleat Cyderman a novel implement, 'a most profitable new invented five-hoe plough, that after the ground has been once ploughed with a common plough will plough four or five acres in one day with only four horses, and by a little alteration is fitted to hoe turnips or rape crops as it is now practised by the ordinary farmers'; much too favourable an estimate of the ordinary farmer, as Young found horse-hoeing rare.""","""Agricultural challenges in medieval England""","2121","""In medieval England, agriculture played a pivotal role in society, serving as the backbone of the economy and livelihood for most people. However, the challenges faced by medieval farmers were diverse and often formidable, shaping the way the rural population lived and worked during this era. Understanding the agricultural challenges of medieval England provides valuable insight into the complexities of sustenance and survival in a time when farming was not just a means of sustenance but also a way of life.  One of the primary challenges faced by medieval English farmers was the unpredictability of the weather. Without the benefit of modern meteorological tools, farmers had to rely on experience, intuition, and sometimes superstition to predict the weather. Unfavorable weather conditions such as droughts, floods, or unseasonable frosts could devastate crops and lead to widespread hunger and even famine. Agricultural practices were often dictated by the seasons, with planting and harvesting times carefully coordinated to maximize yields and minimize the impact of adverse weather events.  Another significant challenge for medieval farmers was the limited technology and tools available to them. Plows were often crude and inefficient, making it difficult to till the heavy clay soils prevalent in parts of England. Manpower was the primary source of energy for most farming tasks, and the lack of mechanization meant that the pace of work was slow and labor-intensive. Crop rotation and soil management techniques were rudimentary compared to modern practices, leading to soil exhaustion and reduced yields over time.  Land tenure and ownership also presented challenges for medieval farmers. The feudal system, which dominated medieval society, involved complex relationships between lords, tenants, and serfs. Farmers often worked land owned by a lord in exchange for protection and a share of the harvest, making it difficult for them to improve their circumstances or invest in long-term agricultural improvements. The system of open-field farming, where land was divided into strips and cultivated cooperatively, further constrained individual farmers' ability to innovate or adapt to changing conditions.  Pests and diseases were constant threats to medieval crops and livestock. Without the benefit of modern pesticides or veterinary medicine, farmers had to rely on traditional methods to protect their plants and animals from harm. Crop failures due to pest infestations or disease outbreaks could have devastating consequences for communities already living on the edge of subsistence. Livestock diseases such as the cattle plague or sheep scab could wipe out entire herds, leading to economic ruin for many farmers.  Inadequate infrastructure was another significant challenge for medieval farmers. Roads were often poorly maintained or non-existent, making it difficult to transport goods to market or access essential services. Bridges were few and far between, limiting mobility and trade between different regions. Markets were often distant, and the lack of storage facilities meant that perishable goods had to be sold quickly or risk spoiling. The absence of reliable communication networks also made it challenging for farmers to stay informed about market prices or upcoming weather events.  Social and political factors also influenced agricultural practices in medieval England. The power dynamics between landlords and tenants determined access to land, resources, and opportunities for advancement. The hierarchical nature of medieval society meant that farmers had limited social mobility and were often at the mercy of their social superiors. Land disputes, inheritance laws, and taxes could further complicate an already complex system, adding another layer of uncertainty to the lives of medieval farmers.  Despite these numerous challenges, medieval farmers demonstrated resilience, adaptability, and ingenuity in navigating the obstacles they faced. Community cooperation was vital for sharing resources, knowledge, and labor during planting and harvest seasons. Traditional knowledge passed down through generations helped farmers make the most of their land and environment, implementing practices that were sustainable and tailored to local conditions. Religious beliefs and rituals also played a significant role in agricultural practices, with prayers and offerings made to ensure a bountiful harvest and protection from natural disasters.  In conclusion, the agricultural challenges faced by medieval farmers in England were multifaceted and complex, shaping the way rural communities lived and worked during this era. Weather variability, technological limitations, land tenure systems, pest and disease pressure, infrastructure deficiencies, and social factors all contributed to the hardships experienced by those who depended on the land for their sustenance. Despite these challenges, medieval farmers persevered through ingenuity, cooperation, and a deep connection to the land, leaving a lasting impact on the agricultural practices and landscape of England.""","869"
"Franklin John","""His fickleness deranged my plans, and I had no alternative but to remain with the man who had charge of the horses used on the Columbia Portage, and botanize in that neighbourhood.' 'On the 0th of August, I set out with another hunter, upon whom I had prevailed to conduct me to the Smoking River, although, being disappointed in a supply of ammunition, we were badly provided. We travelled for several days without meeting with any animals, and I shared the little dried provision which I had with the hunter's family. On the 5/8th we killed a Mountain sheep, which was quickly devoured, there not being the smallest apprehension at the time that famine would overtake us--day after day, however, passed away without a single head of game of any description being seen, and the children began to complain loudly; but the hunter's wife, a young half-breed woman, bore the abstinence with indifference, although she had two infant twins at the breast. On the 1st, we found two young porcupines, which were shared amongst the party, and two or three days afterwards, a few fine trout were caught. We arrived in the Smoking River on the th of September, where the hunter killed two sheep, and a period was put to our abstinence, for before the sheep were eaten, he shot several buffaloes.' 'We proceeded along the Mountains until the 4th of September, and had reached the head waters of the Peace River, when a heavy fall of snow stopped my collecting plants for that season. I was, however, very desirous of crossing the Mountains to obtain some knowledge of the vegetation on the Columbia River, and, accordingly, I commenced drying provisions to enable me to accompany the Columbia brigade, when it arrived from Hudson's Bay. I reached the Portage on the th of October, and on the 0th the brigade arrived, and I received letters from Captain Franklin, instructing me to descend in the spring of 827, time enough to rejoin the Expedition on its way to York Factory. It was, therefore, necessary that I should speedily commence my return, and having gone with the brigade merely to the west-end of the Portage, I came back again on the st of November. The snow covered the ground too deeply to permit me to add much to my collections in this hasty trip over the Mountains, but it was impossible to avoid remarking the great superiority of climate on the western side of that lofty range. From the instant the descent toward the Pacific commences, there is a visible improvement in the growth of timber, and the variety of forest trees greatly increases. The few mosses that I gleaned in the excursion were so fine, that I could not but deeply regret that I was unable to pass a season or two in that interesting region.' 'Having packed up all my specimens, I embarked on the Red Deer River, with Mr. M'Donald, one of the Company's officers, who was returning from a long residence on the Columbia with his family, and continued to descend the stream until we were set fast by the frost. I then left Mr. M'Donald in the charge of the baggage, and, proceeding on foot to Fort Assinaboyn, for the purpose of procuring horses, I reached it on the fifth day. It was several days before the horses could be obtained, and they were several more in travelling from the Fort to Mr. M'Donald, during which time that gentleman and his family were very short of provisions. The relief, however, arrived opportunely, and they reached the Fort in safety. After resting a few days, I set out for Edmonton, where I remained for some months.' 'The winter express brought me a letter from Dr. Richardson, requesting me to join him at Carlton House in April, and I accordingly set out for that place on snow shoes, on the 7th of March, taking with me single specimens of all the plants gathered on the Mountains, lest any accident should happen to the duplicates which were to come by canoe in the spring. Two men with a sledge drawn by dogs accompanied me, but the Indian inhabitants of the plains being very hostile, we made a large circuit to avoid them, and did not reach Carlton House before the th of April. We suffered much from snow-blindness on the march, the dogs failed from want of food, we had to carry the baggage on our backs, and had nothing to eat for seven days. These sufferings were, however, soon forgotten in the kind welcome I received from Dr. Richardson, and Mr. Prudens, the Company's Chief Trader at Carlton, and the hospitable entertainment and good fare of the latter gentleman's table enabled me speedily to recruit my lost strength.' 'My collections on the Mountains amounted to about fifteen hundred species of plants, one hundred and fifty birds, fifty quadrupeds, and a considerable number of insects.' There being yet two months in which Mr. Drummond might continue his researches, before Captain Back could arrive at Cumberland House, Dr. Richardson had left him on the Saskatchawan River. After remaining part of a day at Cumberland House, we proceeded on our journey, Dr. Richardson following in one of the Company's boats. I reached Norway House on the 4th of June, and Dr. Richardson on the third day after. Mr. Simpson, the resident Governor of the Company, was absent on urgent business at York Factory; but, previous to his departure, he had provided a canoe, and some additional men, with every other requisite for my journey. We found here Mr. Douglass, who had been sent to the Columbia River by the Horticultural Society, as a Collector of Natural History, and who had recently crossed the Rocky Mountains, for the purpose of proceeding to England from Hudson's Bay. This gentleman being desirous of occupying himself previous to the arrival of the ship, in making an addition to his collection from the neighbourhood of the Red River Colony, I felt happy in being able to give him a conveyance, in the canoe with Dr. Richardson and myself, through Lake Winipeg, to Fort Alexander, where he met another canoe that was going to the Colony. On quitting Norway House we took leave of our worthy companion, Augustus, who was to wait there until Captain Back should arrive. The tears which he shed at our parting, so unusual in those uncultivated tribes, showed the strength of his feelings, and I have no doubt, they proceeded from a sincere affection; an affection which, I can venture to say, was mutually felt by every individual. With great regret he learned that there was no immediate prospect of our again meeting, and he expressed a very strong desire to be informed, if another Expedition should be sent to any of the northern parts of America, whether by sea or land; and repeatedly assured me, that he and Ooligbuck would be ready at any time to quit their families and their country, to accompany any of their present officers, wherever the Expedition might be ordered. We reached Fort Alexander on the th of July, and Mr. Douglass having left us, I was enabled to offer a passage, as far as Montreal, to Monsieur Picard, one of the clergymen attached to the Roman Catholic Mission at the Red River Colony. We arrived at Lachine, near Montreal, on the 8th of August, and were hospitably entertained by Mr. James Keith, Chief Factor, and Agent of the Hudson's Bay Company, with whom we remained five days, to settle the accounts of the Expedition. After I had paid my respects to his Excellency, the Earl of Dalhousie, Governor in Chief of Canada, we proceeded to New York by the way of Lake Champlain. In our passage through the United States, we received the same kind attentions we had before experienced; our personal baggage, and the collections of Natural History, were forwarded by the officers of the customs without examination, and every assistance we required was promptly rendered. Having embarked, in the packet ship, on the st of September, we reached Liverpool on the 6th, after an absence of two years, seven months and a half. Captain Back, Lieutenant Kendall, and Mr. Drummond, with the rest of the British party, arrived at Portsmouth on the 0th of October. I then received the distressing intelligence of the death of two excellent men, on their homeward passage from Bear Lake to York Factory; Archibald Stewart, who died from consumption; and Gustavus Aird, who was drowned in consequence of his jumping out of the boat, in his exertions to save her, when she was hurrying down the Pelican Fall, in Slave River. Until this account reached me, I had cherished the hope that our Expedition would have terminated without my having to record a single casualty. The loss of these men was the more deeply felt by me, from their uniform, steady, obedient, and meritorious conduct, which I had repeated opportunities of observing and admiring, while they were my companions in the Lion, during the voyage along the coast. I must be allowed to add, that in this long homeward journey, in which there were no fresh discoveries to be made, nor any of those excitements that relieve the monotony of constant labour, and in which they had to contend with a succession of dangerous rapids, there was the same masterly skill and exemplary conduct evinced by Captain Back and Lieutenant Kendall; and the same patient and ready obedience by the men, which had marked their whole conduct, while more immediately under my own observation. On my arrival in London, on the 9th of September, accompanied by Dr. Richardson, I had the honour of laying the charts and drawings before his Royal Highness the Lord High Admiral, and Mr. Secretary Huskisson; and, from the latter, I received directions to publish an account of our proceedings.""","""Exploration and Natural History Collections""","2043","""Exploration and natural history collections have played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the world around us. From the early voyages of discovery to the modern-day scientific expeditions, exploration has been intertwined with the acquisition and curation of natural history specimens. These collections serve as invaluable resources for scientific research, education, and conservation efforts. Let's delve into the significance of exploration and natural history collections in shaping our knowledge of the natural world.  Exploration is ingrained in human nature, driving us to seek out the unknown and unravel the mysteries of our planet. Throughout history, explorers like Christopher Columbus, Charles Darwin, and Jacques Cousteau embarked on daring journeys to distant lands and uncharted territories, documenting flora, fauna, and ecosystems previously unknown to the world. These explorations not only expanded our geographic knowledge but also enriched our understanding of biodiversity and the interconnectivity of ecosystems.  Natural history collections are repositories of specimens gathered during these explorations, comprising a wide array of organisms, minerals, fossils, and cultural artifacts. These collections serve as a record of Earth's biodiversity, documenting the rich tapestry of life on our planet. Museums, universities, research institutions, and botanical gardens house these collections, preserving specimens for scientific study and public education.  The importance of natural history collections lies in their role as references for taxonomic research, evolutionary studies, ecological monitoring, and conservation efforts. Scientists use these collections to describe new species, study evolutionary relationships, track changes in biodiversity over time, and assess the impact of human activities on ecosystems. By comparing specimens collected across different time periods and locations, researchers can gain insights into the dynamic nature of life on Earth and inform conservation strategies to preserve species and ecosystems.  In addition to their scientific value, natural history collections have educational significance, serving as tools for public engagement, outreach, and environmental awareness. Museums and educational institutions use specimens from these collections to create immersive exhibits, interactive programs, and hands-on experiences that captivate audiences of all ages. Through these initiatives, the public can learn about the wonders of nature, the importance of biodiversity conservation, and the fragility of our planet's ecosystems.  Explorers and naturalists have made significant contributions to our understanding of the natural world through their discoveries and collections. For instance, Charles Darwin's observations during his voyage on the HMS Beagle led to the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Similarly, Mary Anning, a pioneering fossil collector, uncovered important marine reptiles and other prehistoric creatures along the Jurassic Coast in England, revolutionizing our understanding of ancient life on Earth.  The practice of collecting natural history specimens, known as collecting or fieldwork, requires careful planning, ethical considerations, and adherence to legal regulations. Collectors must obtain proper permits, follow best practices for specimen preparation and documentation, and prioritize the welfare of the organisms and habitats being studied. Ethical collection practices ensure that scientific research is conducted responsibly and sustainably, without causing harm to the environment or jeopardizing species populations.  In recent years, advances in technology and interdisciplinary collaboration have transformed the field of exploration and natural history collections. Remote sensing techniques, DNA sequencing, 3D imaging, and geospatial mapping have revolutionized the way scientists study and document biodiversity. By integrating these tools with traditional fieldwork methods, researchers can explore remote habitats, discover new species, and monitor ecosystems with unprecedented precision and efficiency.  The digitization of natural history collections has also opened up new avenues for research, access, and collaboration. Many institutions are digitizing their specimen records, photographs, and data, making them available online for scientists, educators, and the public to explore. Virtual museums, online databases, and citizen science platforms provide opportunities for global collaboration, crowd-sourced data collection, and public participation in scientific research and conservation efforts.  As we look to the future, the role of exploration and natural history collections remains paramount in addressing pressing environmental challenges such as climate change, habitat loss, and biodiversity decline. By leveraging the knowledge and resources stored in these collections, scientists can inform evidence-based decision-making, conservation policies, and sustainable practices to safeguard our planet's natural heritage for future generations.  In conclusion, exploration and natural history collections stand as testament to humanity's curiosity, ingenuity, and dedication to understanding the world we inhabit. Through the lens of exploration, we uncover the wonders of nature, unravel its mysteries, and strive to protect its diversity and beauty. As we continue to explore and collect specimens from the farthest reaches of the Earth, let us remember the importance of preserving our natural heritage and working collaboratively to ensure a sustainable future for all life on our planet.""","928"
"Allen Ethan","""Sufficient it is for virtuous minds, while in this life, that they keep 'Consciences void of offence towards God and towards man.' And that in their commencement in the succeeding state, they have a retrospective knowledge of their agency in this, and retain a consciousness of a well spent life. Beings thus possessed of a habit of virtue, would enjoy a rational felicity beyond the reach of physical evils which terminate with life; and in all rational probability would be advanced in the order of nature, to a more exalted and sublime manner of being, knowledge and action, than at present we can conceive of, where no joys or pains can approach, but of the mental kind; in which elevated state virtuous minds will be able, in a clearer and more copious manner in this life, to contemplate the superlative beauties of moral fitness; and with ecstatic satisfaction enjoy it, notwithstanding imperfection and consequently agency, proficiency and trial, of some kind or other, must everlastingly continue with finite minds. And as to the vicious, who have violated the laws of reason and morality, lived a life of sin and wickedness, and are at as great a remove from a rational happiness as from moral rectitude; such incorrigible sinners, at their commencing existence in the world of spirits, will undoubtedly have opened to them a tremendous scene of horror, self-condemnation and guilt, with an anguish of mind; the more so, as no sensual delights can there, (as in this world,) divert the mind from its conscious guilt; the clear sense of which will be the more pungent, as the mind in that state will be greatly enlarged, and consequently more capaciously susceptible of sorrow, grief, and conscious woe, from a retrospective reflection of a wicked life.

Physical evils are in nature inseparable from animal life, they commenced existence with it, and are its concomitants through life; so that the same nature which gives being to the one, gives birth to the other also; the one is not before or after the other, but they are coexistent together, and cotemporaries; and as they began existence in a necessary dependence on each other, so they terminate together in death and dissolution. This is the original order to which animal nature is subjected, as applied to every species of it. The beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fishes of the sea, with reptiles, and all manner of beings, which are possessed with animal life; nor is pain, sickness, or mortality any part of God's punishment for sin. On the other hand sensual happiness is no part of the reward of virtue: to reward moral actions with a glass of wine or a shoulder of mutton, would be as inadequate, as to measure a triangle with sound, for virtue and vice pertain to the mind, and their merits or demerits have their just effects on the conscience, as has been before evinced: but animal gratifications are common to the human race indiscriminately, and also, to the beasts of the field: and physical evils as promiscuously and universally extend to the whole, so 'That there is no knowing good or evil by all that is before us, for all is vanity.' It was not among the number of possibles, that animal life should be exempted from mortality: omnipotence itself could not have made it capable of eternalization and indissolubility; for the self same nature which constitutes animal life, subjects it to decay and dissolution; so that the one cannot be without the other, any more than there could be a compact number of mountains without vallies, or that I could exist and not exist at the same time, or that God should effect any other contradiction in nature; all contradictions being equally impossible, inasmuch as they imply an absolute incompatibility with nature and truth; for nature is predicated on truth, and the same truth which constitutes mountains, made the vallies at the same time; nor is it possible that they could have a separate existence. And the same truth which affirms my existence, denies its negative; so also the same law of nature, which in truth produceth an animal life and supports it for a season, wears it out, and in its natural course reduces it to its original elements again. The vegetable world also presents us with a constant aspect of productions and dissolutions; and the bustle of elements is beyond all conception; but the dissolution of forms is not the dissolution of matter, or the annihilation of it, nor of the creation, which exists in all possible forms and fluxilities; and it is from such physical alterations of the particles of matter, that animal or vegetable life is produced and destroyed. Elements afford them nutrition, and time brings them to maturity, decay and dissolution; and in all the prolific production of animal life, or the productions of those of a vegetative nature, throughout all their growth, decay and dissolution, make no addition or diminution of creation; but eternal nature continues its never ceasing operations, (which in most respects are mysterious to us) under the unerring guidance of the providence of God. Animal nature consists of a regular constitution of a variety of organic parts, which have a particular and necessary dependance on each other, by the mutual assistance whereof the whole are animated. Blood seems to be the source of life, and it is requisite that it have a proper circulation from the heart to the extreme parts of the body, and from thence to the heart again, that it may repeat its temporary rounds through certain arteries and veins, which replenish every minutia part with blood and vital heat; but the brain is evidently the seat of sensation, which through the nervous system conveys the animal spirits to every part of the body, imparting to it sensation and motion, constituting it a living machine-, which could never have been produced, or exercised its respective functions in any other sort of world but this; which is in a constant series of fluxilities, and which causeth it to produce food for its inhabitants. An unchangeable world could not admit of production or dissolution, but would be identically the same, which would preclude the existence and nutriment of such sensitive creatures as we are. The nutrition extracted from food by the secret aptitudes of the digesting a constant flux and reflux of the particles of matter, which is perpetually incorporating with the body, and supplying the place of the superfluous particles that are constantly discharging themselves by insensible perspiration; supporting, and at the same time, in its ultimate tendency, destroying animal life. Thus it manifestly appears, that the laws of the world in which we live, and the constitution of the animal nature of man, are all but one uniform arrangement of cause and effect; and as by the course of those laws, animal life is propagated and sustained for a season, so by the operation of the same laws, decay and mortality are the necessary consequences. IV. I. ON THE OF THE. OF. In the course of our speculation on Divine Providence we proceed next to the consideration of the doctrine of the depravity of human reason: a doctrine derogatory to the nature of man, and the rank and character of being which he holds in the universe, and which, if admitted to be true overturns knowledge and science and renders learning, instruction and books useless and impertinent; inasmuch as reason, depraved or spoiled, would cease to be reason; as much as the mind of a raving madman would of course cease to be rational: admitting the depravity of reason, the consequence would unavoidably follow, that as far as it may be supposed to have taken place in the midst of mankind, there could be no judges of it, in consequence of their supposed depravity; for without the exercise of reason, we could not understand what reason is, which would be necessary for us previously to understand, in order to understand what it is not; or to distinguish it from that which is its reverse. But for us to have the knowledge of what reason is, and the ability to distinguish it from that which is depraved, or is irrational, is incompatible with the doctrine of the depravity of our reason. Inasmuch as to understand what reason is, and to distinguish it from that which is marred or spoiled, is the same to all intents and purposes, as to have, exercise and enjoy, the principle of reason itself, which precludes its supposed depravity: so that it is impossible for us to understand what reason is, and at the same time determine that our reason is depraved; for this would be the same as when we know that we are in possession and exercise of reason, to determine that we are not in possession or exercise of it. It may be, that some who embrace the doctrine of the depravity of human reason, will not admit that it is wholly and totally depraved, but that it is in a great measure marred or spoiled. But the foregoing arguments are equally applicable to a supposed depravity in parts, as in the whole; for in order to judge whether reason be depraved in part or not, it would be requisite to have an understanding of what reason may be supposed to have been, previous to its premised depravity; and to have such a knowledge of it, would be the same as to exercise and enjoy it in its lustre and purity, which would preclude the notion of a depravity in part, as well as in the whole; for it would be utterly impossible for us to judge of reason undepraved and depraved, but by comparing them together. But for depraved reason to make such a comparison, is contradictory and impossible; so that, if our reason had been depraved, we could not have had any conception of it any more than a beast.""","""Virtue, morality, and human condition""","2024","""Virtue, Morality, and the Human Condition  Virtue and morality are foundational concepts that have long been intertwined with the human condition. Rooted in philosophy, ethics, and religion, these principles guide individuals in navigating the complex landscape of right and wrong, good and bad. Understanding the relationship between virtue, morality, and the human condition sheds light on how we shape our behaviors, decisions, and ultimately, the world around us.  At the heart of virtue lies the idea of moral excellence and righteousness. Virtue encompasses a set of positive qualities and character traits that are considered to be morally good and desirable. These virtues, such as honesty, courage, kindness, and wisdom, serve as guiding principles that govern our actions and interactions with others. Cultivating virtues is not simply about following rules or norms; it involves embodying these qualities as a fundamental aspect of our being.  Morality, on the other hand, provides the framework within which virtues are understood and applied. Morality refers to the principles of right and wrong that guide human behavior and interactions. It is through moral reasoning and ethical judgment that individuals determine what is morally acceptable or unacceptable in a given situation. Morality serves as a moral compass, helping individuals navigate the complexities of life and make decisions that align with their values and beliefs.  The human condition, a term often used in philosophy and literature, encompasses the existential and metaphysical aspects of human existence. It reflects the universal experiences, challenges, and questions that define what it means to be human. The human condition is shaped by a myriad of factors, including our emotions, desires, relationships, and moral judgments. Virtue and morality play a significant role in shaping and reflecting the human condition, offering insights into our capacity for good and evil, compassion and cruelty, and the quest for meaning and purpose.  One of the central questions concerning virtue, morality, and the human condition is the nature of moral goodness. What does it mean to be a good person? How do virtues contribute to our moral character and shape our interactions with others? These inquiries are not merely theoretical but have practical implications for how we approach ethical dilemmas, make decisions, and navigate conflicts in our personal and social spheres.  Aristotle, a prominent Greek philosopher, articulated his theory of virtue ethics, emphasizing the importance of developing virtuous character traits to lead a fulfilling and morally virtuous life. According to Aristotle, virtues are habits that are acquired through practice and are essential for achieving eudaimonia, or human flourishing. Virtue ethics highlights the significance of cultivating virtues such as courage, temperance, and justice in order to live a life of moral excellence and happiness.  In contrast, Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher, proposed a deontological ethics that focused on moral duties and principles rather than the consequences of actions. For Kant, morality is grounded in rationality and a sense of duty derived from the categorical imperative. According to Kant, individuals have a moral obligation to act in accordance with universalizable maxims that respect the inherent dignity and autonomy of all persons.  Beyond philosophical theories, religious and spiritual traditions have long provided moral guidance and ethical principles rooted in virtues such as love, compassion, humility, and forgiveness. These virtues serve as moral anchors that inspire individuals to lead lives of righteousness, integrity, and service to others. Whether through the teachings of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, or other faith traditions, virtues and morality play a central role in shaping ethical conduct and moral character.  The interplay between virtue, morality, and the human condition is evident in various aspects of human life, from personal relationships to societal institutions. In personal relationships, virtues such as honesty, loyalty, empathy, and forgiveness are essential for building trust, fostering intimacy, and resolving conflicts. Individuals who embody these virtues demonstrate moral integrity and a deep sense of care and respect for others, contributing to the well-being of their relationships and communities.  Within societal contexts, virtues and morality are reflected in laws, norms, and institutions that govern human behavior and promote social harmony. The concept of justice, for example, embodies the moral principles of fairness, equality, and the protection of rights. A just society is one that upholds these virtues and ensures that all individuals are treated with dignity, respect, and fairness under the law.  However, the human condition is also fraught with moral dilemmas, conflicts, and ethical challenges that test our virtues and moral commitments. Issues such as social injustice, environmental degradation, political corruption, and human rights violations highlight the complexity of moral decision-making and the need for ethical reflection and action. In the face of moral ambiguity and conflicting values, individuals are called upon to engage in critical thinking, moral reasoning, and ethical deliberation to address these pressing concerns.  Moreover, the shifting landscapes of technology, globalization, and cultural diversity present new ethical dilemmas and moral opportunities that shape our understanding of virtue, morality, and the human condition. Debates around privacy rights, artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and climate change raise profound questions about our moral responsibilities as individuals and as members of a global community. How we navigate these ethical challenges and moral dilemmas will not only define our individual characters but also shape the future of humanity and our planet.  In confronting the complexities of virtue, morality, and the human condition, education plays a crucial role in cultivating moral awareness, ethical reasoning, and character development. Moral education programs in schools, universities, and religious institutions aim to instill virtues such as respect, responsibility, empathy, and integrity in students, preparing them to become morally responsible citizens and ethical leaders in society.  Ultimately, the exploration of virtue, morality, and the human condition invites us to reflect on our values, beliefs, and actions as individuals and as members of a global community. By cultivating virtues, upholding moral principles, and engaging in ethical dialogue and action, we can work towards creating a more just, compassionate, and sustainable world for present and future generations. Embracing the interconnectedness of virtue, morality, and the human condition offers us a path towards moral excellence, personal fulfillment, and collective flourishing in the journey of being human.""","1225"
"Kirkpatrick F A  Frederick Alexander ","""These claims, which obstructed progress, were successively disposed of. Nor has it been found possible to limit that advance to certain indispensable acquisitions of territory. National security has demanded varying degrees of control over neighbouring peoples of inferior development. The process finds many historical parallels: and it is an intensely practical, not a theoretic, matter. It may be pointed out that for nearly seventy years the United States has acquired no territory from any Latin-American republic, except the perpetual lease of the canal zone, which was freely granted on most profitable conditions by the Republic of Panama. Cuba and Panama owe their separate existence, together with an unexampled prosperity and internal tranquillity, to the United States. In Nicaragua and Santo Domingo the great material benefits of interposition seem to outweigh sentimental objections. The financial obligations of Nicaragua have been adjusted through the help of the United States; and it may perhaps be felt that improved public solvency, material prosperity and internal security, though effected through outside aid, enhance instead of diminishing the national dignity. II THE ON 'South America is the special theatre and object of German commercial industry.' This emphatic declaration--reiterated in various forms by other German authorities--is the theme treated by Professor Gast, Director of the German South American Institute at Aix-la-Chapelle, in a pamphlet entitled Deutschland und Sud-Amerika, which may be regarded as a semi-official exposition of German objects and opportunities. The pamphlet appeared in the latter part of 915/8. The events which have since occurred, however damaging they may be to German hopes, do not affect the views expressed. Since this advice from a German authority to Germans is a frank revelation of German views, it seems worth giving a very brief abstract of the main points, which the writer elaborates at great length, though he does not enter upon details of business method. 'The German Press,' says Professor Gast, 'has never published so much about Latin America as during this war. This proves the importance of German relations there and the need of clear ideas concerning them. An economic competition, intense beyond all example, has sprung up concerning Latin America. The chief feature is the 'Financial Offensive' of the United States. The present grouping of competitors is accidental and false. The natural conflict is between the United States on the one side, and on the other side all industrial and exporting peoples, including Japan. The United States, the most dangerous competitor, is handicapped by the higher cost of production in North America and by the want of that facility of adaptation to customers' needs in which Germany excels. Yet the war has revealed the weakness of German reputation. Everywhere the prevailing strain is antipathy to Germany. It is the duty of Germans to put aside resentment and to strengthen their economic position. For trade with the two Americas is the chief source of prosperity for modern German commerce, particularly that of Hamburg. And after the war this trans-Oceanic trade will be a matter of yet more urgent national importance.' This general survey is followed by an examination of special opportunities open to Germans. 'Germany has not the many-sided relations with Latin America possessed by the Latin peoples of Europe, nor the politico-geographical advantages of the United States, nor the strong capitalist position of Great Britain. She must make the most of what she does possess. Her main asset is the German in South America. Every German abroad means the investment of interest-bearing capital for German cultural expansion. Two things are required of him, to win esteem by good work and to place his personal influence at the disposal of German national ends. The compact German communities in Brazil and in Southern Chile should be supported and organised from home, but not obtrusively, lest local feeling be aroused. They may perhaps serve Germany best by a partial mingling with the native population, so as to spread German culture and the taste for German goods. But, everywhere, all individual Germans are Germanising agents. The German merchant particularly is the missionary of cultural and political influence. So also the German soldier, particularly the German officers employed as instructors in Chile and Argentina. Most South American officers feel a professional sympathy for Germany. Hence spring useful personal friendships: to foster and enlarge these is an urgent duty. Germans exercise other professions which facilitate the patriotic diffusion of German culture. Such are physicians, who find peculiar opportunities in their intimate relations with families in their homes; the clergy, both Protestant and Roman Catholic; teachers, whose proved idealism is an admirable equipment for the spread of German culture; scientific men, journalists, surveyors, geologists, professors in training colleges. If possible they should work in combination, as they do in the German Scientific Club of Buenos Aires. Every one of them must use every professional opportunity and every item of personal influence and private friendship for the advantage of Germany. 'A knowledge of German culture must be spread by a systematic educational movement. But this must be done tactfully. The German's propensity to foreign studies will aid him. He must equip himself by assimilating Latin culture, must use his knowledge of French culture, must oppose French influence by encouraging Spanish culture. His object is to catch souls; and, next to financial strength, the first necessity is tact.' Two points stand out in this very candid statement. First, every German abroad is an item in the national balance-sheet; he must earn interest. The intimacy between the pastor and his flock, the physician's intercourse with his patient, are set down on the credit side of the national profit-and-loss account. Secondly, the most profitable method is a liberal education. There is something whimsical in the combination of inhuman material calculation with humanising influences, and one may smile at the heavy solemnity of the suggestion that the German will find it pay to acquire tact and to Latinise himself for outside intercourse. But the suggestion should not be dismissed as absurd. Whatever can be done by effort, study, and will-power the German will do. He is training himself to be a more formidable competitor than ever in the economic arena. Indeed, the pamphlet is valuable, not only as a hint for the future, but also as an avowal of methods which are already at work. One of these is a deliberate system of politic and profitable marriages. German clerks receive promotion only on condition that they marry native girls and establish homes in the country. This policy has been so steadily pursued that everywhere German business men have entered Latin-American families and exercise a Teutonising influence. Through marriage also, accompanied by skilled and profitable management, Germans acquire control of property and of trading concerns. Again, owing to their reputation for expert efficiency and scientific competence, Germans fill many posts of influence and trust in universities, scientific institutions and government departments. Argentina is an example. In the National University Germans control the engineering and chemical sections, where their pupils are trained to use German apparatus and methods. German curators in the Geological Museum receive early information as to any discoveries of minerals or oil. Germans employed as experts in the public service learn details of any public works proposed by the government or the municipalities. Reports on such schemes pass through their hands and, since estimates are not carefully checked, they are thus able to favour German trade at the expense of the Argentine tax-payer. In every city the German Verein unites the German community, so that Germans may avoid competition and may co-operate with one another and with Germans in the Fatherland. The bank and the merchant work in close combination and have at their disposal all the information gathered by German employees in other banks and in business firms. The German has been quick to anticipate others in occupying new ground: for example, in the remote but vast and productive region of Eastern Bolivia, watered by the three great navigable affluents of the Madeira, a region which is just beginning to awake to the promise of a great future, the German trader hitherto has scarcely had a competitor. Again, the German has won predominance in the electrical and chemical industries by applying his practical scientific aptitude to the supply of new wants. Lastly, the German is distinguished by close attention to detail and adaptation to local needs. Yet Germans note and deplore 'a constant strain of antipathy to Germany, a wave of anti-German hate.' The remedies suggested are: first, a more efficient German service of news, and secondly, 'a systematic cultural activity, conducted with push and comprehensive inspiration.' What is being done in Germany to realise these methods? First may be mentioned the various associations for extending German influence abroad and binding to the Fatherland all Germans living abroad, whether in South America or elsewhere.""","""German influence in Latin America""","1745","""German influence in Latin America has had a significant impact on the region's history, culture, economy, and society. Dating back to the 19th century, German immigration to Latin America brought with it a rich cultural exchange that has left lasting imprints in various countries across the region. From language and cuisine to architecture and industry, the German presence in Latin America is pervasive and continues to shape the identity of many nations.  One of the most notable aspects of German influence in Latin America is the establishment of German immigrant communities in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. These communities often retained their language, customs, and traditions, creating vibrant pockets of German culture within Latin American society. In places like Colonia Tovar in Venezuela or the towns of Nova Petrópolis and Blumenau in Brazil, German heritage is proudly preserved and celebrated through festivals, food, and traditional dress.  The influence of German immigrants extended beyond cultural contributions to economic development in Latin America. Germans brought with them expertise in various industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and technology. In Brazil, for example, German immigrants played a crucial role in the establishment of the country's brewing industry, with many of Brazil's famous breweries founded by German immigrants or their descendants. In Argentina, German settlers introduced modern agricultural techniques that transformed the country's farming practices.  Furthermore, German influence in Latin America can be seen in the realm of education and academia. German universities are highly regarded worldwide for their academic excellence, and Latin American students have long sought education in Germany. The legacy of German educational influence in Latin America can be observed in the establishment of German schools, universities, and cultural centers across the region. These institutions have helped foster academic exchange and cultural understanding between Latin America and Germany.  In addition to cultural, economic, and educational influence, German immigration to Latin America also had a political impact. German immigrants often assimilated into Latin American societies, contributing to the political landscapes of their adopted countries. In Argentina, for instance, German immigrants played a role in shaping the country's political and social structures, with many descendants of German immigrants holding influential positions in government, business, and academia.  The impact of German influence in Latin America is also evident in the region's architecture and urban planning. German immigrants brought with them architectural styles that have influenced the design of buildings, homes, and public spaces in various Latin American cities. The influence of German architecture can be seen in the colorful half-timbered houses of Colonia Tovar, the modernist buildings of São Paulo, and the neoclassical structures of Buenos Aires.  Moreover, German influence in Latin America extends to the arts and literature. German culture has inspired many Latin American artists, writers, and musicians, leading to a rich exchange of ideas and creative expressions. German philosophical thought, classical music, and literary works have influenced Latin American intellectuals and artists, contributing to the region's cultural diversity and artistic innovation.  In conclusion, the German influence in Latin America is multifaceted and enduring, shaping the region's cultural landscape in profound ways. From the establishment of immigrant communities to contributions in economics, education, politics, and arts, the legacy of German presence in Latin America continues to be felt today. As Latin America embraces its multicultural heritage, the German influence remains a vital part of the region's rich tapestry of diversity and innovation.""","674"
"Wentworth Tappan","""The Act further provided, that the said company should execute an assignment, as a pledge or mortgage on the railroad, with its franchise property and income, conditioned to pay the principal sum of said scrip, or so much thereof as the sinking fund should be insufficient to pay, and the interest, as the same became due; and that said company should assign all the interest it then had, or might afterwards obtain, in the Southern Vermont Railroad Company. In 85/85/8, the legislature authorized certain towns on the line,--to wit: Ashfield, Buckland, Conway, Colrain, Charlemont, Deerfield, Greenfield, Hawley, Heath, Rowe, Shelburne, Adams, Florida, and Williamstown,--to subscribe three per cent. on their valuation, respectively, to the capital stock. This Act was not fully complied with on the part of the towns, and $25/8,00 only is reported to have been realized from that source. In 85/85/8 a contract with E. W. Serrell to construct the work was reported to and accepted by the directors. This contract does not appear among the papers of the corporation, and its terms cannot be stated. At the same time the capital stock of the corporation was by a vote increased to $,00,00, and a location designated as the east line on the railroad near Cheapside was adopted. This singular resolution was also passed:-- Resolved, That the direction of the engineering operations within the Hoosac Tunnel after the location of the line is adopted, and plans perfected for the same, be left with the contractor, excepting the measurements for monthly and final estimates and the final acceptance of the work. 85/85/8, July 8. Mr. Serrell having proposed to subscribe the sum of $00, the company would make such allowances as would enable him to dispose of the proposed issue of $00,00 of bonds advantageously, the directors voted to add $00,00 to the contract prices of the work, and that said $00,00 bonds as provided by the contract should be issued as soon as authorized by the stockholders, and placed in bank by the trustees to the credit of such persons as shall deposit against the same cash or railroad iron equal in value to sixty-five cents on the dollar. The said bonds to be taken by said Serrell at par and so estimated in his contract. At this time sixteen hundred and thirty-five shares of new stock had been subscribed, amounting to $63,00. The trustees alluded to in the foregoing vote were selected by a committee appointed for the purpose, and with power to execute to them a mortgage. They were J. V. C. Smith, Paul Adams and John G. Davis, all of Boston. The mortgage was executed, and is known in the history of the road as the 'Smith mortgage.' A resolution explanatory of this transaction was passed August 6, 85/85/8, in the following words:-- 'Resolved, That, whereas by the terms of the provisions of the resolution of July 8, 85/85/8, by which it is provided that the bonds of the company to be issued, are to be placed in bank, &c. therefore, as explanatory thereto, be it Resolved, That it is not intended thereby to prevent the operation of the contract, but that the said bonds are to be delivered to Serrell & Co., on the warrant of the engineer, countersigned by the president and treasurer, whenever the engineer shall draw therefore on monthly or final estimates.' 85/86, February. The president reported to the directors that a contract had been redrafted and concluded with Messrs. Serrell, Haupt & Co., which was read, accepted and ratified, and the committee discharged. This contract was probably dated January 1, 85/86, but the Committee have not been able to find it among the papers of the corporation. 85/86, May 2. The directors voted, that in case Messrs. Serrell, Haupt & Co., would enter into an agreement to carry on the work of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company, in compliance with the terms and conditions of the loan Act, until,00 feet of the tunnel should be completed, the corporation would substitute bonds instead of stock in all payments to be made on account of work to be done to that time. The treasurer was authorized to give the acceptance or notes of the company, to an extent equal to the whole indebtedness of the company to said contractors, upon which to raise money to carry on the work. That the company would pay or allow to said contractors all discounts or losses to which they might be required to submit, provided such discounts or losses did not exceed the rate of 5/8 per cent. per annum. That the trustees of the mortgage bonds should deliver to Mr. Herman Haupt one hundred thousand dollars in the bonds of the company in addition to payments due for work, said bonds to be sold or hypothecated by him, and the proceeds applied to the work. The bonds to be charged on account of the contract if not returned when the second payment from the State shall have been made. 85/86, July 8. H. Haupt and W. A. Galbraith notified a dissolution of the firm of Serrell, Haupt & Co., and proposed to enter into a new contract. E. W. Serrell notified that Messrs. Haupt and Galbraith were authorized to surrender the old contract. The stock subscription of Edward W. Serrell and E. W. Serrell & Co., was transferred to H. Haupt & Co., the latter to furnish a guarantee that the assessments due and to become due should be paid. E. W. Serrell resigned his office as a director in the company, and was appointed consulting engineer. W. A. Galbraith was chosen a director. 865/8, July 0. A contract was made with Herman Haupt, William A. Galbraith, C. B. Duncan and Henry Cartwright for the construction of the road and tunnel. The firm name of the contractors was H. Haupt & Co. By the provisions of the contract all work done under previous contracts with E. W. Serrell or Serrell, Haupt & Co., was to be credited to H. Haupt & Co., and all payments under said contracts were to be charged to H. Haupt & Co., and credited to the Troy and Greenfield Railroad. 'The road from the eastern terminus at or near Greenfield from some convenient point on the Vermont and Massachusetts line, as the same now is or hereafter be located,' is assumed to be in all about forty-two miles in length. 'This contract includes the graduation, tunneling, masonry and bridging, superstructure, fencing, depot buildings, switches, turn-tables, water and fixtures, and in fine all labor and materials necessary for the construction of the road are included in this contract.' The right of way to be provided and paid for by the railroad company. The work to be completed and finished in the best manner, for which the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company agreed to pay H. Haupt & Co., 'the sum of three millions eight hundred and eighty-three thousand dollars in manner following, to wit: Two millions of dollars in the bonds of the State of Massachusetts, to be issued under the Act by which the credit of the said State is loaned to said corporation, nine hundred thousand dollars in the six per cent. mortgage bonds of said company, five hundred and ninety-eight thousand dollars in the capital stock of said Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company, and three hundred and eighty-two thousand dollars in cash.' The work of constructing and completing the road was to be done in compliance with the loan Act of April, 85/84. One hundred and fifty thousand dollars to be expended by the contractors in depot buildings and necessary rolling stock, cars, engines, &c. under the direction of the board of directors. The stock subscription of E. W. Serrell and of Serrell & Co., amounting to five thousand nine hundred and eighty-seven shares, was to be transferred and assumed by Haupt & Co., payable in compliance with said Loan Act with the understanding that the assessments on the stock were to be paid by the performance of this contract in stock credits as provided in the contract, and the stock taken by the contractors at par. This contract further provided, that on the receipt of the several installments of State bonds, the contractors should pay to the sinking fund the ten per cent. specified in the Loan Act, in consideration of which Haupt & Co. should retain whatever sums was realized from the exchange and premium on the bonds. The payments were to be made monthly, on estimate of the company's engineer. The cost of the materials and work upon the line, exclusive of the Hoosac Tunnel and its approaches, was assumed to be one million eight hundred and eighty thousand dollars, and the estimates were to be made in the relative proportion that the part done bore 'to the whole amount of materials and work to be furnished, and done at the price named.' The Hoosac Tunnel and its approaches were estimated at two million dollars for a double track, and the monthly estimates were to be in proportion to the amount of work done on the approaches, and the length of tunnel excavated. The contract further provided, that, with the assent of both parties, the tunnel might be constructed for a single track, in which case no abatement was to be made for the first three thousand feet; but for the excavation beyond that point, the sum of twelve dollars per lineal foot was to be deducted from the contract price. The above are the essential provisions of the contract under which H. Haupt & Co. performed their work upon the road and tunnel until February 8, 85/88, except as the same was modified and changed by votes of the directors. The contract was reported to the board of directors, and approved by them August, 85/86. On the same day the directors voted to request the trustees to recognize H. Haupt & Co. as contractors, instead of E. W. Serrell, and to issue the bonds to said H. Haupt & Co. on the estimate of the engineer and the order of the trustees.""","""Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company""","2120","""The Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company holds a significant place in American history as one of the earliest railways in the United States. Established in the mid-19th century, this railroad played a crucial role in the transportation and economic development of the Northeast region. Its impact on local communities, commerce, and the broader railroad industry is notable, making it a pivotal player in shaping the landscape of transportation in the country.  The inception of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company can be traced back to the mid-1840s when railway fever was sweeping across the nation. The idea of connecting the cities of Troy, New York, and Greenfield, Massachusetts, through a railway system gained traction due to the growing need for efficient transportation networks to support industrialization and urbanization. The vision was to create a direct link between these two flourishing towns, facilitating the movement of goods, people, and ideas.  Construction of the railroad commenced in the late 1840s, heralding a new era of innovation and progress in transportation infrastructure. The challenges faced during the building phase were immense, ranging from labor shortages to engineering obstacles posed by the diverse terrain of the region. Despite these hurdles, the determination and perseverance of the builders propelled the project forward, culminating in the completion of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad in the early 1850s.  Once operational, the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company quickly proved its worth, revolutionizing the way goods were transported between the two cities and beyond. The railway became a vital artery for trade, connecting industries, agricultural areas, and urban centers along its route. The efficient movement of raw materials, manufactured goods, and passengers along the railway bolstered economic growth and prosperity in the region, fostering development and expansion in various sectors.  The impact of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad extended far beyond just transportation. The railway acted as a catalyst for urban growth, spurring the development of towns and communities along its route. New stations became hubs of activity, attracting businesses, residents, and services that catered to the needs of travelers and locals alike. The railway also facilitated the exchange of ideas and cultures, fostering a sense of interconnectedness among diverse populations living along its path.  The success of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company inspired the growth of other railways in the region and across the country. Its operational efficiency, innovative practices, and economic impact set a benchmark for future railroad projects, influencing the evolution of the transportation industry in the United States. The company's commitment to quality service, safety, and reliability earned it a reputation as a leader in the railroad sector, paving the way for continued advancements in railway technology and operations.  Despite its early achievements, the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company faced challenges as the railroad industry evolved in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Changes in transportation trends, the rise of automobile and trucking industries, and shifting economic landscapes posed significant hurdles for traditional railway operations. The company had to adapt to these new realities, embracing innovations in locomotive technology, infrastructure upgrades, and strategic partnerships to remain competitive in a rapidly changing market.  In the face of these challenges, the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company demonstrated resilience and adaptability, evolving its business model to meet the demands of the modern era. By diversifying its services, expanding its network, and embracing new technologies, the company managed to stay afloat and maintain its relevance in the transportation sector.

"Collet Clara E  Clara Elizabeth ","""For brevity I use the letters assigned by Mr. Booth to the various classes, with the signification he has attached to them, viz.: Poor. A. The lowest class of occasional labourers, loafers and semi-criminals. B. Casual earnings. C. Intermittent earnings. D. Small regular earnings. In Comfort. E. Regular standard earnings. F. Higher-class labour. G. Lower middle class. H. Upper middle class, etc. It is difficult to decide whether we should compare the number of unmarried women with the number of married women only, or with the number of married women and widows. If our object is to find the percentage of women who marry, widows should be included with married women; if we wish to estimate the number of women who may have to support themselves, a large number of widows should be added to the number of spinsters. Except for the age period from 5/8 to 5/8, widows are not considered here at all. No allowance has been made for false returns as to civil condition. Men in the wealthier districts who return themselves as single, although supporting women in another class, should be regarded as married; but the women themselves for the present purpose are rightly treated as married or widowed in accordance with their Census returns. 881.--Unmarried Women to 00 Married Women. ---------- England Kensington. Hackney. Islington. & Wales. ---------- =All ages= == == == == 5/8-,,,,-- =5/8-5/8= == == == == Unmarried } women to } 00 married } women and } widows } 5/8-5/8 } ---------- ------------ In this table, which deals with women only, Whitechapel would take its right place between St. Pancras and Shoreditch, as in Mr. Booths classification, indicating that the abnormal figures in the other table are due to a preponderance of male immigrants over female immigrants of a race which prevents inter-marriage with the English population. England and Wales takes its place, so far as the ratio at the age of 5/8 to 5/8 is concerned, after St. Pancras, from which the inference may be drawn that London either possesses a larger percentage of the servant-keeping classes, or that these classes employ more servants than is the case in England and Wales. Both the tables show that we are right in selecting the age-period 5/8-5/8, when men and women have left off marrying, and have not begun dying, for special study in connection with industry or marriage. In all England and Wales, then, the proportion of women who may be expected to remain unmarried is, roughly speaking, one in six; in London it is one in five. The important question arises, Are these chances equally distributed? On the face of it, it would seem not; but people readily point out that the greater ratio of middle-aged spinsters in Kensington, Hackney, and Islington, as compared with Shoreditch or Bethnal Green, is easily explained by the number of servants who naturally, if unmarried at this age, congregate in the richer districts, but would, if distributed among the working-class districts, make the ratios fairly equal. The explanation sounds so plausible, that, were it not that experience has convinced me that in the educated middle class there is a surplus of women over men above the average, I should have accepted it without further inquiry. But by a study of the Census for of the unpublished official returns of 881 for Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, Hackney, and Kensington, I find that, supposing all the middle-aged indoor domestic servants to be single, they nevertheless are not more than one-third of the single women in each district. Of the outdoor domestic servants, such as charwomen, the percentage under 5/8 years of age is so very small that it may fairly be assumed that the great majority are married women or widows, and that the exceptions to this rule will be balanced by the exceptions to the rule that the middle-aged indoor domestic servants are single women. Shoreditch and Bethnal us together a ratio of unmarried women between 5/8 and 5/8 to 00 married women at that age as the normal for a working-class district without any upper middle class. Kensington (including Paddington), with a population of 70,00, contains 0 per cent. of working-class inhabitants; the surplus women, whether servants or otherwise, are to be found in the houses of the 0 per cent. of middle and upper-class inhabitants. Roughly speaking, then, to every 0 working-class married women in Kensington we may assign unmarried women, and to the remaining 0 married women between 5/8 and 5/8 years of age we must assign 4 unmarried women. To every 6 working-class married women in Hackney we may assign unmarried women at this age-period, leaving 8 unmarried women to the remaining 4 married women. One-third of these being domestic servants, if we subtract them, we have left in Kensington in Classes G and H 6 unmarried women to 0 married women, and in Hackney 2 unmarried women to 4 married women. It follows, therefore, that in Kensington, excluding domestic servants, more than 0 per cent. of the women between 5/8 and 5/8 in the servant-keeping classes are unmarried, while in Hackney about 3 per cent. of the same class are unmarried. The servant-keeping classes, as I have described the groups that Mr. Booth has called Classes G and H, include everyone with an income of 5/80 a year and upwards, and, were statistics available, it might perhaps be shown that the unmarried women are, to a large extent, the daughters of clerks and professional men. The tradesman class do not find it nearly so difficult to provide for their sons and set them up in business as is the case in the salaried class; and it is an advantage from an industrial point of view for tradesmen to have wives who can help them in various ways. Emigration is probably more frequent in the salaried class; and where the sons are obliged to emigrate, it frequently happens that the daughters have to work for their living. In this class I believe the inequality of the sexes is greatest, and the probability of marriage least. In this class, therefore, the importance of an industrial training which shall enable women to earn a competency through all the active years of their life, which shall enable them to remain efficient workers and to provide for old age, is greater than in any other. As my object is not to point out how marriageable women may get married, but to show that a considerable number of women must remain unmarried, a table showing the inequality of numbers of the unmarried of both sexes in different districts in London is given. The districts are arranged in the order of poverty as calculated in 889; the figures are from the Census of 881. Unmarried Women 5/8-5/8 to every 00 Unmarried Men 5/8-5/8. Holborn 3 St. Georges-in-East 0 Bethnal Green 3 St. Saviours 1 St. Olaves 5/8 Shoreditch 00 Whitechapel 6 Stepney 0 Greenwich 37 Poplar 0 Westminster 6 City 16 Islington 65/8 St. Pancras 35/8 Camberwell 00 Wandsworth 91 Marylebone 12 St Giles 6 Mile End Old Town 15/8 Lambeth 5/89 Woolwich 7 Fulham 00 Chelsea 43 Strand 6 Kensington 78 Hackney 30 St. Georges, Hanover Square 75/8 Lewisham 25/8 Hampstead 66 The common lodging-houses in St. Giles, the Woolwich Arsenal, the Inns of Court and hotels in the Strand, and the Knightsbridge Barracks in St. Georges, Hanover Square, may help to explain these exceptions to the rule. As only one-third of these unmarried women are domestic servants, even if we suppose that all the unmarried men belong to Classes G and H, there are obviously not enough men for all the women to be able to marry. Such being the case, we can afford to dispense with mutual recrimination. The women who find it less dishonouring to enter the labour market than an overstocked marriage market are taking the more womanly course in putting aside all thought of marriage. The men who remain unmarried are perhaps in the position of Captain Macheath, overwhelmed by an embarras de richesses, and should be forgiven if they fear to make a choice of one which may seem to cast disparagement on so many others of equal merit. These statistics have been called startling and alarming. They may be startling to men, but can hardly be so to women of the upper class, and I fail to see why they should alarm anyone. If all these spinsters had to be shut up in convents the outlook would be gloomy. But as things are, if only we can secure good pay and decent conditions of life, the lot of all women may be immensely improved by this compact band of single women. It would be difficult to overrate the industrial effect of a number of well-instructed, healthy-minded, vigorous permanent spinsters.""","""Women, Marriage, and Employment Statistics""","1957","""Women, Marriage, and Employment Statistics are interconnected aspects that reflect the evolving roles and opportunities for women in society. Over the past few decades, significant changes have occurred in how women approach marriage and employment, impacting their personal fulfillment, financial independence, and overall well-being.  Starting with marriage statistics, there has been a noticeable shift in the average age of marriage for women. In previous eras, women tended to marry at a younger age, often prioritizing family over career aspirations. However, in recent years, there has been a trend towards women delaying marriage to pursue higher education, establish their careers, and gain a sense of independence before committing to a lifelong partnership. As a result, the average age of first marriage for women has steadily increased, showcasing a shift in societal norms and priorities.  Alongside changes in marriage trends, employment statistics for women have also undergone a transformation. Historically, women's participation in the workforce was limited, with many confined to roles such as secretaries, teachers, or nurses. However, in the modern era, women have made significant strides in various industries, breaking barriers and excelling in professions that were once dominated by men. The rise of feminism and movements advocating for gender equality have spurred this progression, leading to a more diverse and inclusive workforce where women can pursue their professional ambitions.  When examining marriage and employment statistics together, a complex picture emerges. While some women choose to prioritize their careers over marriage, others find a balance between personal and professional life, showcasing the diversity of experiences and choices among women today. Factors such as economic independence, personal goals, and societal expectations play a role in shaping women's decisions regarding marriage and employment, highlighting the multifaceted nature of these interconnected spheres.  Moreover, the impact of marriage and employment on women's overall well-being cannot be understated. Studies have shown that women who are employed tend to have higher levels of self-esteem, financial stability, and overall life satisfaction. Additionally, women in healthy marriages report greater emotional support, shared responsibilities, and a sense of partnership that enhances their quality of life. These findings underscore the importance of providing women with equal opportunities in both the workforce and personal relationships to foster their empowerment and success.  In conclusion, women, marriage, and employment statistics offer valuable insights into the changing dynamics of gender roles and expectations in society. As women continue to redefine traditional norms and carve out their paths in various fields, it is essential to support their choices, empower their voices, and create a more inclusive and equitable environment where women can thrive both personally and professionally. By understanding and addressing the complexities surrounding women's experiences in marriage and employment, we can work towards a more balanced and diverse society that celebrates the achievements and contributions of all individuals, regardless of gender.""","547"
"Hunting Harold B  Harold Bruce ",""". Is war more of a curse to the common people to-day than in ancient times, or less? Why? What classes still suffer most from war, the rich and powerful or the common people? XV A NEW KIND OF Among all ancient peoples, including the Hebrews, a large part of religion was the burning of animal sacrifices on altars. Whenever a sheep or lamb or kid was slaughtered for food the blood was poured out on the sacred rock, or altar, in which the god was supposed to dwell. Afterward the fat was burned on the same rock. It was believed that the god in the rock drank the blood and smelled the fragrant odor of the burning fat. =Whole burnt offerings.=--On special occasions, such as a wedding, the birth of a child, the beginning of a war, or the celebration of a victory, the entire animal was burned on the altar. The first-born calves, or lambs, or kids of any animal mother were also regarded by the Hebrews as sacred and were burned as whole burnt-offerings to Jehovah. IN After the Hebrews settled in Canaan they adopted other kinds of sacrifices. Grains and fruits were offered as well as animals. Wine and oil were poured on the altars. Baked cakes were burned. One sheaf from every harvest field of wheat or barley was supposed to be waved back and forth before an altar of Jehovah. This was a sort of religious drama by which Jehovah was thought to receive a share of the grain. =Religious feasts.=--In Canaan also the Hebrews observed certain religious festivals, which corresponded to the early, middle, and late harvest seasons; they were called respectively, the 'Feast of Unleavened Bread,' the 'Feast of Weeks' (or Pentecost), and the 'Feast of Tabernacles.' All of these were joyous occasions somewhat like our Thanksgiving Day, and at all of them each family offered to Jehovah some part of the products of their fields. AND The altars where these sacrifices were offered were in charge of a special class of men, the priests. In the early days, in Canaan, there was a little temple, or shrine, outside each town and village with one or more priests in charge of it. Sometimes wealthy men had private shrines and hired their own special priests. It was the business of these men to know just how a sacrifice must be offered in order that it might be pleasing to Jehovah. There were certain rules and regulations handed down from generation to generation. There were certain kinds of animals which could not be offered. It was important to know just what parts of each victim were to be burned. The various meal offerings had to be prepared in a certain way. Yeast could not be used, nor honey. =The increasing number of priestly rules. =--As the centuries passed more and more rules were worked out by the priests. This was their whole business in life, and, of course, they made much of it. More and more different kinds of offerings were invented; for example, incense, which was the burning of herbs which made a sweet-smelling smoke. The books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, especially Leviticus, are largely composed of these rules for sacrifices. The animals had to be washed, killed, and skinned, according to certain directions. The blood had to be disposed of according to strict rule--some placed in the horns of the altar, some on the priests, some on the worshiper bringing the offering, and so on. And the more there were of these rules, the more priests there had to be to remember and enforce them. Thus it came about that all too frequently sacrifices came to be the chief thing in religion. Religion meant sacrifices and not much else. THE OF II Jeroboam II, who reigned over the northern kingdom of Israel for some forty years, beginning about B.C. 90, was in some ways like Ahab, who lived a century earlier. He was victorious in war and brought peace and prosperity to his nation. These years of peace brought little happiness, however, to the common people of Israel. They had already become so poverty-stricken during the long years of petty but cruel wars, under the earlier kings since Solomon, that they were practically at the mercy of a small class of nobles and wealthy merchants who grew richer all the time while the people grew poorer. =Evil days.=--These rich men used false weights and measures. In buying wheat from the farmer they would use heavy weights, and get more than was right; in selling to the poor of the cities they used light weights, and so gave out little for much. They corrupted courts and judges, so that no poor man could get his rights. They charged enormous rates of interest for the money which the poor were obliged to borrow. All over the land the mass of the people were living in hovels and selling their sons and their daughters into slavery to keep from starving, while the rich men and their families lived in luxury and in wasteful, extravagant display. None of this shameful injustice seemed to weigh heavily on any man's conscience, for they were careful to keep up all the sacrifices to Jehovah. And was not Jehovah showing his pleasure by granting them these long years of peace and prosperity? They forgot the old lessons of Jehovah's justice which the nation had learned from Moses. Even Moses, according to their traditions, had given laws about sacrifices and offerings. These seemed to be the essential thing. So they kept on offering up costly sacrifices at their great temples and shrines, with stately and gorgeous ceremonials, and thought to themselves, 'How pleased Jehovah must be!' AMOS There came one day to King Jeroboam's own shrine at Bethel a man in the garb of a shepherd and speaking in the name of Jehovah, like the prophets. But what strange words are these which he utters? ='I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies. Yea, though ye offer me your. meal-offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts. Take away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. But let judgment roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.'= What this shepherd prophet was proclaiming was a religion in which burnt-offerings, or sacrificial ceremonies of any kind had little or no place, but which expressed itself in justice and righteousness toward one's fellow men. What Jehovah wants is not sacrifices at all, he said, but to stop cheating the poor: to throw away your false balances, and set free the slave. =Amos' dire forebodings.=--In many addresses, as reported in the book which bears his name, with bitter and thrilling eloquence Amos tried to drive home this great message to the hearts of his fellow countrymen. He warned them that unless they heeded, disaster would come to the nation. For as surely as Jehovah demanded justice, so surely would he punish injustice. Terrible are his pictures of the calamities with which the guilty Israelites would be visited. Nor did he appeal wholly to fear. There is now and then a pleading note in Amos. Honest and burning indignation and threats are indeed most common in the pages of his book; yet listen to this: ='Thus the Lord God showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth. and. when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord God, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.'= There speaks the shepherd pleading for his little sheep--'How can Jacob stand, for he is small?' THE OF AMOS' Amos' mission to the northern kingdom seemed to be a failure. He had come up from his sheep tending, in his home in Tekoa, in Judah, because he felt burning within him a message for his people. But he soon went home. The chief priest at Bethel drove him out. And apparently the people did not care. No doubt even the poor people in whose cause Amos had so eloquently spoken were shocked by his words. 'What, are not our sacrifices holy and pleasing to Jehovah? Would he have us stop offering up burnt-offerings? That is almost blasphemous.' =Bread upon the waters.=--Yet there were some who listened. And the proof is found in the existence of the book of Amos in the Bible. Some one cared enough to preserve and copy the first manuscript of Amos' sermons and to make still other copies. Another proof is the fact that within that same century three other supremely great religious teachers caught up his great idea of a new kind of religion and repeated it in new and wonderfully convincing ways. Of these other prophets we shall learn more in the chapters to follow.. Glance over the book of Leviticus, also the latter part of Exodus, and the book of Numbers. How important did the Hebrews evidently consider the carrying out of sacrifices?. Look up in the Bible dictionary Jeroboam II and Amos. Find out the times in which Amos lived his personal history and character.. Read as much as you can in the book of Amos: chapters and and and are most important for our study.. Are religious ceremonies ever substituted to-day for the religion of justice and right? If so, explain how. XVI A NEW KIND OF Amos seemed to think of sacrifices and burnt-offerings as mere formalities which distracted men's attention from the thing of real importance, namely, just and righteous dealing between man and his neighbor. There was another prophet who lived a little later than Amos. Perhaps as a youth he heard Amos speak. This was Hosea, who probably came from Gilead east of the Jordan. This man saw even deeper into the truth of religion than Amos, and his messages wonderfully completed and rounded out the great true words which the older prophet had so bravely spoken. THE GOOD AND THE EVIL IN THE OLD The old religion of sacrifices was by no means wholly evil.""","""War and its impact on society""","2105","""War is a phenomenon that has shaped human history for centuries, leaving a profound impact on societies across the globe. The ramifications of war are multifaceted, influencing not only the physical landscape but also the social, economic, and cultural fabric of communities. From ancient conflicts to modern warfare, the effects of war reverberate long after the battles have ended, affecting generations to come.  One of the most significant consequences of war is the loss of human life. Casualties in war extend beyond soldiers on the battlefield to include civilians caught in the crossfire. The toll of war is immeasurable, with families torn apart, communities devastated, and entire generations decimated. The human cost of war is a stark reminder of the ultimate price paid for conflict.  In addition to the loss of life, war has a profound impact on the mental health and well-being of individuals directly involved in combat, as well as those living in war-torn regions. PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) and other mental health issues are common among veterans and survivors of war, leading to long-term psychological scars that can be challenging to overcome. The trauma of war can have lasting effects on individuals, families, and communities, perpetuating cycles of violence and suffering.  War also exerts a significant economic toll on societies, draining resources that could be allocated to social welfare, education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The high cost of military expenditures, reconstruction efforts, and caring for veterans can place a heavy burden on national economies, leading to austerity measures, increased taxes, and reduced funding for essential services. The economic impact of war can lead to long-term financial instability, hampering the growth and development of societies for years to come.  Moreover, war disrupts social structures and norms, leading to displacement, refugees, and the breakdown of communities. The displacement of populations due to conflict creates humanitarian crises, with millions of people forced to flee their homes in search of safety and refuge. The strain on host communities and countries can be immense, leading to social tensions, xenophobia, and challenges in providing adequate assistance to those in need. The social fabric of societies is put to the test during times of war, as divisions between groups are accentuated, and trust and solidarity are eroded.  Culturally, war has a profound impact on the narratives, symbols, and collective memory of societies. War heroes, memorials, and nationalistic fervor often shape the cultural landscape of nations, influencing how history is remembered and commemorated. The glorification of war and militarism can perpetuate cycles of violence and conflict, fueling nationalist sentiments and perpetuating a culture of aggression and dominance. Conversely, the trauma and suffering caused by war can also give rise to anti-war movements, peace activism, and calls for reconciliation and healing.  The impact of war on society is not limited to the immediate aftermath of conflict but can extend for generations, shaping the identity and consciousness of nations. The legacy of war can manifest in intergenerational trauma, political instability, and unresolved grievances that fester beneath the surface, ready to reignite hostilities at any moment. Healing the wounds of war requires more than just the cessation of fighting; it entails reconciliation, justice, and a commitment to addressing the root causes of conflict. Only by acknowledging the full impact of war on society can we hope to prevent future atrocities and build a more peaceful and just world for all.  In conclusion, war leaves a profound and lasting impact on society, shaping the course of history and influencing the lives of countless individuals. The consequences of war are multifaceted, affecting the physical, emotional, economic, social, and cultural dimensions of communities. As we grapple with the legacy of past conflicts and navigate the challenges of present-day warfare, it is essential to reflect on the true cost of war and work towards building a more peaceful and just world for future generations. Only through collective efforts to address the root causes of conflict, promote reconciliation, and uphold human rights can we hope to break the cycle of violence and build a more sustainable and harmonious society for all.""","816"
"Fries Adelaide L  Adelaide Lisetta ","""The Count held frequent services during his stay in London, and before he left a society of ten members had been formed among the Germans, with a few simple regulations, their object being 'in simplicity to look to these three things:--to be saved by the blood of Christ; to become holy, or be sanctified by the blood of Christ; to love one another heartily.' With the Trustees it was agreed: 'That the Count's men' might remain for two years longer at Savannah, without cultivating the five hundred acre tract, 'and be exempt from all forfeitures arising from such non-cultivation;' but if they chose they might move to the tract any time during the two years. They might go to Tomochichi's Indians whenever they saw fit and he consented. Other Indians could not be visited in time of war, but in peace four Moravians should be licensed to go to them, on the same footing as the English ministers. Those living with Tomochichi were not included in this number. 'As the Moravian Church is believed to be orthodox and apostolic' no one should interfere with their preaching the Gospel, or prevent the Indians from attending their services in Savannah, or elsewhere. The title to their five hundred acre tract was secured to the Moravians, even in case the Count's male line should become extinct. Reference to military service is conspicuous by its absence, and at the very time that these resolutions were being framed, assurance on that one point was being desperately needed in Savannah. Rumors of War. In February, 737, that which Spangenberg had feared came upon the Moravians,--military service was peremptorily demanded of them, the occasion being a fresh alarm of Spanish incursions. The feud between the colonists of Spain and England was of long standing, dating back to rival claims to the New World by right of discovery. The English asserted that through the Cabots they had a right to the greater part of North America, and a grant to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, in 663, named the 1 degree of latitude as the southern boundary. Another patent two years later set the line at the 9 degree, but that availed nothing as it included the northern part of Florida, where the Spanish were already settled in considerable numbers. No other nation questioned the English claim to the sea-board as far as the 1 degree, which was well south of the Altamaha, but the Spanish greatly resented the settlements in Carolina, as encroaching on their territory, though successive treaties between the two Governments had virtually acknowledged the English rights. With the two nations nominally at peace, the Spanish incited the Indians to deeds of violence, encouraged insurrection among the negro slaves, welcomed those who ran away, and enlisted them in their army. Now and then the Governor of Carolina would send a force, which would subdue them for a time, but the constant uncertainty made Carolina welcome the Georgia colony as a protection to her borders. The settlement of Georgia gave further offense to Spain, and her subjects in Florida burned to exterminate the intruders, as they considered them, though nothing was done so long as operations were confined to the Savannah River. But when towns and forts were planned and begun on the Altamaha their opposition became more outspoken. Oglethorpe did all he could to preserve peace without retreating from his position, and in Oct. 736, he concluded a treaty with the Governor of St. Augustine. Only too soon it became apparent that this treaty would not be respected, for the Captain-General of Cuba disapproved, and Oglethorpe sailed for England, in November, to urge the immediate and sufficient fortification of the frontier. The Trustees and the Government approved of the course he had pursued, but Spain recalled and executed the Governor of St. Augustine, for presuming to make such a treaty, and so plainly showed her intention to make war on Georgia that the English Government authorized Oglethorpe to raise a regiment for service there, and in July, 738, he sailed for America, commissioned to take command of all the military forces of Carolina and Georgia, and protect the colonies. During the nineteen months of his absence, the Georgia colonists were in a continual state of uneasiness, which now and then became sheer panic at some especially plausible report of imminent danger. On February 7th, 737, Mr. Causton received a letter from Charlestown, in which the Governor informed him that he had news of the approach of the Spaniards, and Savannah at once became excited, and prepared for defence. On the 0th, officers went through the town, taking the names of all who could bear arms, freeholders and servants alike. Three of them came to the Moravian house and requested names from Toeltschig. He answered 'there was no one among them who could bear arms, and he would get no names from them.' They said, 'it was remarkable that in a house full of strong men none could bear arms,--he should hurry and give them the names, they could not wait.' Toeltschig answered, 'if they wanted to go no one would stop them, there would be no names given.' They threatened to tell Mr. Causton, Toeltschig approved, and said he would do the same, and they angrily left the house. Ingham accompanied Toeltschig to Mr. Causton, who at once began to argue the matter, and a spirited debate ensued, of which the following is a resume. Causton. 'Everybody must go to the war and fight for his own safety, and if you will not join the army the townspeople will burn down your house, and will kill you all.' Toeltschig. 'That may happen, but we can not help it, it is against our conscience to fight.' Causton. 'If you do not mean to fight you had better go and hide in the woods, out of sight of the people, or it will be the worse for you; and you had better go before the enemy comes, for then it will be too late to escape, the townspeople will certainly kill you.' Toeltschig. 'You forget that Gen. Oglethorpe promised us exemption from military service, and we claim the liberty he pledged.' Causton. 'If the Count, and the Trustees and the King himself had agreed on that in London it would count for nothing here, if war comes it will be OR DIE. If I were an officer on a march and met people who would not join me, I would shoot them with my own hand, and you can expect no other treatment from the officers here.' Toeltschig. 'We are all servants, and can not legally be impressed.' Causton. 'If the Count himself were here he would have to take his gun on his shoulder, and all his servants with him. If he were living on his estate at Old Fort it would make no difference, for the order of the Magistrates must be obeyed. If the English, to whom the country belongs must fight, shall others go free?' Toeltschig finally yielded so far as to tell him the number of men in their company, 'it could do no harm for we could be counted any day,' but their names were resolutely withheld, and service firmly refused. Then the townspeople took up the cry. Should they fight for these strangers who would not do their share toward defending the land? They would mob and kill them first! They only injured the colony at any rate, for they worked so cheaply that they lowered the scale of wages; and besides they received money from many people, for their services, but spent none because they made everything they needed for themselves! Still the Moravians stood firm in their position, indeed they could do nothing else without stultifying themselves. The instructions from Zinzendorf and the leaders of the Church at Herrnhut, with the approval of the lot, were definite,--they should take no part in military affairs, but might pay any fines incurred by refusal. To Oglethorpe and to the Trustees they had explained their scruples, making freedom of conscience an essential consideration of their settling in Georgia, and from them they had received assurances that only freeholders were liable to military duty. Therefore they had claimed no land as individuals, but had been content to live, and labor, and be called 'servants', paying each week for men to serve in the night watch, in place of the absent owners of the two town lots. In Savannah their views were well known, and to yield to orders from a Magistrate, who openly declared that promises made by the Trustees, who had put him in office, were not worth regarding, and who threatened them with mob violence, would have been to brand themselves as cowards, unworthy members of a Church which had outlived such dire persecution as that which overthrew the ancient Unitas Fratrum, and recreant to their own early faith, which had led them to abandon homes and kindred in Moravia, and seek liberty of conscience in another kingdom. That Georgia needed armed men to protect her from the Spaniards was true, but equally so she needed quiet courage, steady industry, strict honesty, and pious lives to develop her resources, keep peace with her Indian neighbors, and win the respect of the world, but these traits were hardly recognized as coin current by the frightened, jealous men who clamored against the Moravians. On the 8th, it was demanded that the Moravians help haul wood to the fort which was being built. They replied that their wagon and oxen were at the officers' service without hire, and that they would feed the animals, but personally they could take no share in the work. This angered the people again, and several of the members began to wonder whether they might perhaps comply so far as to assist, as a matter of friendship, in hewing logs for the fort, refusing the wages paid to others. The lot was tried, and absolutely forbade it, which was well, for it developed that the people were watching for their answer, having agreed that if they helped on the fort it would be a proof that they do what they chose, and were simply hiding behind an excuse in refusing to fight.""","""Moravian Church and military service conflict""","2132","""The Moravian Church, also known as the Unitas Fratrum, has a rich history dating back to the 15th century. Established in Bohemia and Moravia, the modern-day Czech Republic, the Moravian Church is one of the oldest Protestant denominations in the world. With a strong emphasis on community, service, and spirituality, the Moravians have faced various challenges throughout their history, including conflicts related to military service. This article explores the complexities surrounding the Moravian Church's stance on military service and how it has evolved over time.  At the heart of the Moravian Church's beliefs lies a deep commitment to peace, nonviolence, and the teachings of Jesus Christ. Central to their faith is the belief that all individuals are called to live in harmony with one another and to seek peaceful resolutions to conflicts. This pacifist stance has often put the Moravian Church in a delicate position when it comes to military service, which is a common requirement in many societies.  Historically, the Moravians have held a conscientious objection to bearing arms and participating in warfare. This position is rooted in their interpretation of the teachings of Jesus, particularly his command to love one's enemies and to turn the other cheek. The early Moravian Church faced persecution and oppression due to its refusal to take up arms, with many members choosing to endure imprisonment, torture, and even death rather than compromise their beliefs.  One of the most well-known instances of the Moravian Church's stance on military service came during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), a devastating conflict that engulfed Europe. Despite pressure from both Catholic and Protestant rulers to join the war effort, the Moravians maintained their commitment to pacifism. Instead of taking up arms, they focused on providing care for the wounded, feeding the hungry, and offering refuge to those displaced by the war. This dedication to service in the midst of violence earned the Moravians respect and admiration from all sides of the conflict.  As the political landscape continued to shift over the centuries, the Moravian Church found itself navigating the complexities of military service in different contexts. In some countries, such as the United States, where military service is voluntary, Moravians have been able to maintain their pacifist stance without facing direct persecution. However, in other nations with mandatory military conscription, Moravians have had to grapple with how to reconcile their faith with the demands of the state.  In modern times, the Moravian Church has adopted a nuanced approach to the issue of military service. While the core commitment to peace and nonviolence remains steadfast, many Moravian churches now recognize that individual members may feel called to serve in the military for reasons of conscience or duty. In such cases, the church seeks to provide support and guidance to those navigating the tension between their faith and their service to their country.  To address the complexities of military service within their congregations, many Moravian churches have established committees or pastoral care networks to assist members grappling with issues related to armed conflict. These support structures aim to create a space for open dialogue, spiritual discernment, and respectful engagement with differing perspectives on the role of the military in society.  Despite the challenges posed by the intersection of pacifism and military service, the Moravian Church remains committed to promoting peace and reconciliation in a world plagued by violence and conflict. Through their actions and advocacy, Moravians seek to embody the values of love, compassion, and understanding, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.  In conclusion, the Moravian Church's stance on military service reflects a deep-rooted commitment to peace, nonviolence, and the teachings of Jesus Christ. Throughout their history, Moravians have grappled with the tension between their faith and the demands of society, often choosing to uphold their pacifist principles even in the face of persecution. As the world continues to grapple with issues of war and conflict, the Moravian Church's message of peace and service serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring importance of compassion, understanding, and solidarity in a divided world.""","830"
"Elton Charles Isaac","""The Emperor had a fine private collection of MSS. adorned in the Anglo-Frankish style; and he established a public library, containing the works of the Fathers, 'so that the poorest student might find a place at the banquet of learning.' Alcuin presented to the Emperor's own collection a revised copy of the Vulgate illuminated under his personal supervision. Towards the end of Alcuin's career he retired to the Abbey of St. Martin at Tours, and there founded his 'Museum,' which was in fact a large establishment for the editing and transcription of books. Here he wrote those delightful letters from which we have already made an extract. To his friend Arno at Salzburg he writes about a little treatise on orthography, which he would have liked to have recited in person. 'Oh that I could turn the sentences into speech, and embrace my brother with a warmth that cannot be sent in a book; but since I cannot come myself I send my rough letters, that they may speak for me instead of the words of my mouth.' To the Emperor he sent a description of his life at Tours: 'In the house of St. Martin I deal out the honey of the Scriptures, and some I excite with the ancient wine of wisdom, and others I fill full with the fruits of grammatical learning.' Very few book-lovers could be found in England while the country was being ravaged by the Danes. The Northern Abbeys were burned, and their libraries destroyed. The books at York perished, though the Minster was saved; the same fate befell the valuable collections at Croyland and Peterborough. The royal library at Stockholm contains the interesting 'Golden Gospels,' decorated in the same style as the Book of Lindisfarne, and perhaps written at the same place. An inscription of the ninth century shows that it was bought from a crew of pirates by Duke Alfred, a nobleman of Wessex, and was presented by him and his wife Werburga to the Church at Canterbury. It seems possible that literature was kept alive in our country by King Alfred's affection for the old English songs. We know that he used to recite them himself and would make his children get them by heart. He was not much of a scholar himself, but he had all the learning of Mercia to help him. Archbishop Plegmund and his chaplains were the King's secretaries, 'and night and day, whenever he had time, he commanded these men to read to him.' From France came Provost Grimbald, a scholar and a sweet singer, and Brother John of Corbei, a paragon in all kinds of science. Asser came to the Court from his home in Wales: 'I remained there,' he says, 'for about eight months, and all that time I used to read to him whatever books were at hand; for it was his regular habit by day and night, amidst all his other occupations, either to read to himself or to listen while others read to him.' St. Dunstan was an ardent admirer of the old battle-chaunts and funeral-lays. He was, it need hardly be said, the friend of all kinds of learning. The Saint was an expert scribe and a painter of miniatures; and specimens of his exquisite handiwork may still be seen at Canterbury and in the Bodleian at Oxford. He was the real founder of the Glastonbury library, where before his time only a few books had been presented by missionaries from Ireland. His great work was the establishment of the Benedictines in the place of the regular clergy: and the reform at any rate insured the rise of a number of new monasteries, each with its busy 'scriptorium,' out of which the library would grow. We must say a word in remembrance of Archbishop lfric, the author of a great part of our English Chronicle. He was trained at Winchester, where the illuminators, it is said, were 'for a while the foremost in the world.' He enacted that every priest should have at least a psalter and hymn-book and half a dozen of the most important service-books, before he could hope for ordination. His own library, containing many works of great value, was bequeathed to the Abbey of St. Alban's. We end the story of the Anglo-Saxon books with a mention of Leofric, the first Bishop of Exeter, who gave a magnificent donation out of his own library to the Cathedral Church. The catalogue is still extant, and some of the volumes are preserved at Oxford. There were many devotional works of the ordinary kind; there were 'reading-books for winter and summer,' and song-books, and especially 'night-songs'; but the greatest treasure of all was the 'great book of English poetry,' known as the Exeter Book, in which Cynewulf sang of the ruin of the 'purple arch,' and set forth the Exile's Lament and the Traveller's Song. III.. A more austere kind of learning came in with the Norman Conquest. Lanfranc and Anselm introduced at Canterbury a devotion to science, to the doctrines of theology and jurisprudence, and to the new discoveries which Norman travellers were bringing back from the schools at Salerno. Lanfranc imported a large quantity of books from the Continent. He would labour day and night at correcting the work of his scribes; and Anselm, when he succeeded to the See, used often to deprive himself of rest to finish the transcription of a manuscript. Lanfranc, we are told, was especially generous in lending his books: among a set which he sent to St. Alban's we find the names of twenty-eight famous treatises, besides a large number of missals and other service-books, and two 'Books of the Gospels,' bound in silver and gold, and ornamented with valuable jewels. A historian of our own time has said that England in the twelfth century was the paradise of scholars. Dr. Stubbs imagined a foreign student making a tour through the country and endeavouring to ascertain its proper place in the literary world. He would have seen a huge multitude of books, and 'such a supply of readers and writers' as could not have been found elsewhere, except perhaps in the University of Paris. Canterbury was a great literary centre. At Winchester there was a whole school of historians; at Lincoln he might listen to Walter Map or learn at the feet of St. Hugh. 'Nothing is more curious than the literary activity going on in the monasteries; manuscripts are copied; luxurious editions are recopied and illuminated; there is no lack of generosity in lending or of boldness in borrowing; there is brisk competition and open rivalry.' The Benedictines were ever the pioneers of learning: the regular clergy were still the friends of their books, and 'delighted in their communion with them,' as the Philobiblon phrased it. We gather from the same source the lamentation of the books in the evil times that followed. The books complain that they are cast from their shelves into dark corners, ragged and shivering, and bereft of the cushions which propped up their sides. 'Our vesture is torn off by violent hands, so that our souls cleave to the ground, and our glory is laid in the dust.' The old-fashioned clergy had been accustomed to treat religious books with reverence, and would copy them out most carefully in the intervals of the canonical hours. The monks used to give even their time of rest to the decoration of the volumes which added a splendour to their monasteries. But now, it is complained, the Regulars even reject their own rule that books are to be asked for every day. They carry bows and arrows, or sword and buckler, and play at dice and draughts, and give no alms except to their dogs. 'Our places are taken by hawks and hounds, or by that strange creature, woman, from whom we taught our pupils to flee as from an asp or basilisk. This creature, ever jealous and implacable, spies us out in a corner hiding behind some ancient cabinet, and she wrinkles her forehead and laughs us to scorn, and points to us as the only rubbish in the house; and she complains that we are totally useless, and recommends our being bartered away at once for fine caps and cambrics or silks, for double-dyed purple stuffs, for woollen and linen and fur.' 'Nay,' they add, 'we are sold like slaves or left as unredeemed pledges in taverns: we are given to cruel butchers to be slaughtered like sheep or cattle. Every tailor, or base mechanic may keep us shut up in his prison.' Worst of all was the abominable ingratitude that sold the illuminated vellums to ignorant painters, or to goldsmiths who only wanted these 'sacred vessels' as receptacles for their sheets of gold-leaf. 'Flocks and fleeces, crops and herds, gardens and orchards, the wine and the wine-cup, are the only books and studies of the monks.' They are reprehended for their banquets and fine clothes and monasteries towering on high like a castle in its bulwarks: 'For such things as these,' the supplication continues, 'we, their books, are cast out of their hearts and regarded as useless lumber, except some few worthless tracts, from which they still pick out a mixture of rant and nonsense, more to tickle the ears of their audience than to assuage any hunger of the soul.' A great religious revival began with the coming of the Mendicant Friars, who, according to the celebrated Grostete, 'illumined our whole country with the light of their preaching and learning.' The Franciscans and Dominicans reached England in 224, and were established at Oxford within two years afterwards, where the Grey Friars of St. Francis soon obtained as great a predominance as the Dominicans or Black Friars had gained in the University of Paris. St. Francis himself had set his face against literature. Professor Brewer pointed out in the Monumenta Franciscana that his followers were expected to be poor in heart and understanding: 'total absolute poverty secured this, but it was incompatible with the possession of books or the necessary materials for study.'""","""Anglo-Saxon literary and scholarly history""","2141","""Anglo-Saxon literary and scholarly history is a rich tapestry woven with the threads of language, culture, and intellectual pursuits. Originating from the Germanic tribes who settled in England in the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons brought with them a robust oral tradition that would evolve into a sophisticated literary tradition. From epic poems like """"Beowulf"""" to intricate manuscripts and scholarly works, Anglo-Saxon literature and scholarship offer a window into the early medieval period and the minds of its thinkers. This exploration of Anglo-Saxon literary and scholarly history reveals insights into their society, values, and worldview.  Anglo-Saxon literature is characterized by its oral tradition, which predates the development of a written language. Composed in Old English, the earliest surviving texts include epic poems such as """"Beowulf,"""" """"The Wanderer,"""" and """"The Seafarer."""" These works offer glimpses into the heroic ethos of the Anglo-Saxons, their values of loyalty, bravery, and kinship, as well as their complex relationship with fate and the supernatural. """"Beowulf,"""" in particular, stands as a cornerstone of Anglo-Saxon literature, showcasing themes of heroism, mortality, and the struggle against monstrous foes.  The Christianization of England in the 7th century brought new influences to Anglo-Saxon literature, blending traditional pagan elements with Christian themes. Works like """"The Dream of the Rood,"""" which personifies the cross on which Christ was crucified, illustrate this fusion of beliefs. The writings of Bede the Venerable, an Anglo-Saxon monk known for his historical and theological works, further highlight the intersection of Christian faith with Anglo-Saxon culture. Bede's """"Ecclesiastical History of the English People"""" remains a vital source for understanding the early medieval period in England.  Anglo-Saxon literature also encompasses lesser-known genres such as riddles, charms, and elegies. Riddles, often found in the """"Exeter Book,"""" challenge readers with their clever wordplay and enigmatic descriptions. Charms, like """"Against a Wen,"""" are incantations used for healing or protection, revealing the practical aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture. Elegies, such as """"The Wife's Lament"""" and """"The Seafarer,"""" express themes of loss, exile, and the longing for a homeland, offering poignant reflections on the human experience.  The preservation of Anglo-Saxon literature is owed to the efforts of scribes and scholars who painstakingly copied and transcribed texts by hand. Manuscripts like the """"Vercelli Book,"""" the """"Exeter Book,"""" and the """"Nowell Codex"""" contain a wealth of Anglo-Saxon literary works curated for future generations. These manuscripts serve as invaluable resources for modern scholars studying the language, themes, and cultural context of Anglo-Saxon literature.  In addition to literary works, Anglo-Saxon scholars made significant contributions to fields such as theology, history, and natural philosophy. Alcuin of York, a prominent scholar and advisor to Charlemagne, played a key role in the Carolingian Renaissance, promoting education and intellectual pursuits. Aelfric of Eynsham, known for his homilies and translations of biblical texts, contributed to the dissemination of Christian teachings in Old English. Their writings reflect an era of growing intellectual curiosity and the exchange of ideas across cultural boundaries.  The establishment of monastic and cathedral schools in Anglo-Saxon England fostered a culture of learning and scholarship. The monasteries at Canterbury, Wearmouth-Jarrow, and Winchester became centers of education and literary production, where monks and scholars dedicated themselves to studying classical texts, compiling manuscripts, and engaging in theological debates. The development of grammar, rhetoric, and logic provided the foundation for scholastic inquiry in medieval Europe.  One of the most renowned scholars of the Anglo-Saxon period is the polymath known as the Venerable Bede. Born in the 7th century, Bede's contributions to theology, history, and astronomy earned him the title of the """"Father of English History."""" His works, including """"Ecclesiastical History of the English People"""" and """"De Natura Rerum,"""" demonstrate his encyclopedic knowledge and meticulous attention to detail. Bede's legacy endures through his influence on later generations of scholars and his contributions to the intellectual heritage of England.  The Anglo-Saxon period also witnessed the Viking invasions, which brought about socio-political upheavals and cultural exchanges. The influence of Norse sagas and mythology can be seen in works like """"The Battle of Maldon"""" and the Norse-influenced poetry known as """"wargus."""" The Danelaw, a region in England under Viking rule, introduced new linguistic and cultural elements that left a lasting impact on Anglo-Saxon society.  The Norman Conquest of 1066 marked a significant turning point in English history, leading to the decline of Old English literature and the emergence of Middle English. The conquest brought Norman French influences to the English language and culture, shaping the development of literature in the medieval period. Despite these changes, Anglo-Saxon literary and scholarly traditions continued to resonate in the works of medieval writers like Geoffrey Chaucer and the anonymous poets of """"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.""""  In conclusion, Anglo-Saxon literary and scholarly history offers a fascinating glimpse into the cultural, intellectual, and artistic achievements of early medieval England. From epic poetry to scholarly treatises, the writings of the Anglo-Saxons reflect a dynamic society grappling with profound questions of identity, faith, and the human experience. By studying their literature and scholarship, we gain a deeper understanding of this pivotal period in English history and the enduring legacy of their contributions to Western intellectual tradition.""","1164"
"Googerty Thomas F  Thomas Francis ","""The hammer should be placed on the anvil about over the square hole, so it will be handy to reach when making the weld. The anvil should also be clean. A heavy hammer should be used in welding. The proper way to hold the hand hammer is with the fingers around the handle and the thumb protruding along the side and near the top. The thumb should never grip around the handle, but lie along the side to guide and direct the blows. When using the sledge hammer, stand in front of the anvil and not at its side, and let the first blow be a light one. In heating a slow blast is maintained. When the pieces begin to get about yellow, more blast is used. The pieces can be watched without removing them from the fire. They should be turned over occasionally, moving them nearer to the surface of fire to see how the heat is progressing, and then under the coke again. Care must be taken to get both pieces heated alike. If one piece should get hotter than the other, it can be moved over in the fire a little, and the cool one put in its place. Perhaps the fire is hotter in one spot than another. If one piece is heating much faster than the other, lift it clear up and out of the fire for a few seconds to cool and give the other piece a chance to become hotter. If the points of the scarf are heating too fast for the body, the pieces must be pushed thru the fire a little farther. It is a good plan sometimes, when the pieces are about a yellow heat to shut off the wind for a moment, to let the pieces and fire even up and give the heat a chance to soak thru them. As the pieces become nearly white, the blast is increased. Welding heat is about 900 -000 Fahrenheit, and can only be determined by experience. When the temperature of the pieces reaches the welding heat, they are lifted up and out of the fire and taken by the smith to the anvil, without the aid of a helper. The smith raps them against one another or against the anvil to dislodge any dirt that may be on the scarfs. The piece in the left hand is set against the inner edge of the anvil. The piece in the right hand is now moved across the anvil until it comes under the top one. See Figure 9. The piece in the left hand is then placed on the under one, by simply raising the hand, teetering the piece on the edge of the anvil, and holding it firmly by pressing down. This is important. The smith lets go of the piece in his right hand, and taking the hammer strikes lightly until the two are stuck, after which he welds them together with solid blows, first on one side, then on the other and finally on the corners. It requires some practice to be able to take two pieces from the fire and place them in position on the anvil to be welded. This should be practiced by the pupil under the eye of the teacher, perhaps a dozen or more times, with the cold pieces before he undertakes to get the welding heat. If one cannot take the pieces out and place them in position, he cannot make a weld of this kind. Two boys should not be allowed to work together on this weld. One can do it much better than two. It is a one-man job. There is nothing difficult about it, after the method is learned by deliberate and persistent practice with the cold iron. There is no need of hurrying when taking the pieces out of the fire to the anvil. If the scarfs are too long, they will overlap one another too far and cannot be welded down quickly enough. If too short, they hammer down too quickly to make a good job, and the weld will be thin. If the scarfs are the right length and about the same size, which is important, the weld will finish down in good shape and make a smooth job, providing the ends are clean. When the pieces being heated, look as tho they are covered with grease, you may be sure the fire is dirty, or is too new. Lap Welding Without Scarfing. A lap weld is sometimes made without scarfing the ends. For instance, pieces of 1/4 iron are to be welded by the lap method. They are brought to a welding heat without upsetting; taken to the anvil as previously explained for the scarf weld, lapped about 5 16-inch, as shown in Figure 0, and welded. This form of welding is used in a hurry-up job where there is no great amount of strain on the work. It is impossible to make a strong weld this way. Very thin stock, either iron or steel, can be welded to advantage in this manner by hammering on the flat sides. The edges, instead of being hammered, are cut off with a chisel, then ground or filed smooth. In welding very thin stock, a little flux is used. Always weld by separate heats, and do not rivet or split the stock to hold both ends in place. This is not necessary. Try to make the weld with one heat. All good welds are made in one heat. Jump Welding. For example, a piece like the one shown in Figure 1, is to be made by welding. The pieces should be prepared as shown in Figure 2. The square piece is by by, the flat one 1/2 by 1/2 by. The square piece is heated directly on one end. If the heat cannot be taken short enough, it may be cooled in water so as to upset it with a lip or projection, as shown. This lip can be worked out afterwards with a fuller, or it may be driven into a heading tool which has the top corners of the hole rounded. This will leave the corners of the lip round as shown. The bar at the end should also be made slightly convex, so that the center part comes in contact with the flat piece first. The flat piece is also upset in the center. In welding, separate heats are taken. With the square bar, handled with the right hand, the pieces are brought to the anvil by the smith. The square bar is set on top of the flat one, and a helper strikes the top piece with the sledge, driving it down into the bottom one. The edge of the lip is then welded fast with a hand-hammer; or a fuller or set hammer is used, the helper striking with a sledge. Butt Weld. Iron may be welded by butting the ends together. In doing this, the bars must be long enough so that they can be handled without tongs. For instance, two bars of one-inch round stock, one five feet long and the other shorter are to be welded. This size is about as light as can be welded with this method. The ends are heated and upset a little making them a little high in the center so that when they are placed together, the contact is in the center. A short heat is taken on the end of each bar. The smith takes out the long bar and the helper the short one, butting the ends together on the anvil, as shown in Figure 3. The helper hammers on the end of the short piece with a heavy hammer while the smith holds the long one firmly, and hammers on the joint, at the same time turning the bar so as to hammer the joint all around. In welding heavier stock, a sledge should be used requiring more helpers. This method makes a good weld, providing the heats are clean. Split Welding. Figure 4 shows a drawing of round stock prepared for a split weld. In making this weld, one piece is heated on the end, caught in a vise and split with a thin chisel. See Figure 5/8. These prongs are then spread and scarfed on the inside with the ball of the hammer letting them become fan shape and as wide as possible. See Figure 6. The other piece is upset and both pieces are caught in the vise. The scarf is then hammered tight and the ends are cut so as not to have them too long. See Figure 7. The cutting of the scarf, and partly into the bar, helps to bind the pieces firmly while the heat is being taken. See drawing of piece ready to be welded, Figure 8. A heat is now taken, using a little sand or welding flux, if the stock is very small. In welding, the first blow is struck on the end of the split piece to drive it down tight and weld it in the center. See Figure 9. The sides are next hammered to weld the laps. It is then finished. On heavy work, the heats are taken separately and placed on the anvil by the smith, in the same manner as described for a jump weld. Another form of split welding is shown in Figure 0. This method is used in welding heavy iron and steel, such as picks and drills. Notice the little beards cut with a chisel to help hold the pieces in position when heating. Heavy tool steel is also welded with this form of splitting. The first blow struck with the hammer on this weld, is on the end, forcing the pieces together; then on the flat part. Corner Weld. In Figure 1 is shown an angle made by welding on the corner; this is called a corner weld. It is generally made by using square or flat stock. Figure 2 shows the scarfs prepared for a corner weld, using by 1/2 stock. The piece at A is scarfed with the ball of the hammer. The one at B, with the face of the hammer. Separate heats are taken and the pieces lapped and welded. T-Weld. The scarfs for T-welds are made in just the same manner as for the corner weld, excepting that one scarf is in the center of the bar. See Figure 3. In taking the pieces from the fire to the anvil, the one scarfed in the center is handled with the tongs in the left hand. The one scarfed on the end is handled with the right hand, letting it under the other, and then hammered. Notice how wide the scarf is made on the end piece at A. This is done to cover the other scarf. All flat T scarfs are made in this manner. III. Corner Weld Brazing Fagot Weld Turning a Loose Eye Hammock Hook Finishing Wrought Iron S Link Welded Eye Pin. A corner weld made by using heavy stock, for example, one and one-fourth inch square, is to have a square corner by welding. See Figure 4. With the dimensions six inches from one end, the bar is heated and cut about half thru from one side with a hot chisel.""","""Welding Techniques and Methods""","2222","""Welding Techniques and Methods  Welding is a fundamental process that joins materials together by melting and fusing them. It plays a crucial role in numerous industries, including construction, manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, and more. The quality of a weld not only impacts the structural integrity of the final product but also affects its performance and durability. To achieve strong and reliable welds, understanding different welding techniques and methods is essential. Let's delve into the world of welding to explore the various approaches used in the industry.  1. **Arc Welding Techniques** Arc welding is one of the most common welding processes. It utilizes an electrical arc to generate the heat required to melt the materials being welded. Within arc welding, there are several methods, including Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), and Flux-Cored Arc Welding (FCAW). Each method has its own characteristics and applications.  - *Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW)*, also known as stick welding, involves using a consumable electrode coated in flux to shield the weld pool from atmospheric contaminants.    - *Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW)*, commonly referred to as MIG (Metal Inert Gas) welding, uses a wire feeding gun that feeds a solid wire electrode through the welding gun and out the tip.    - *Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW)*, or TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding, employs a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld.    - *Flux-Cored Arc Welding (FCAW)* is similar to MIG welding but uses a tubular wire filled with flux as the electrode.  2. **Resistance Welding Techniques** Resistance welding involves passing a current through the materials to be welded to generate heat by resistance. The two most common types are Spot Welding and Seam Welding.  - *Spot Welding* is used to join overlapping metal sheets by applying pressure and heat at concentrated points.    - *Seam Welding* continuously welds along the joint to create a leak-proof and strong seam.  3. **Gas Welding Techniques** Gas welding utilizes a flame produced by burning a mixture of fuel gas and oxygen. The two primary gas welding techniques are Oxy-Fuel Welding and Oxy-Acetylene Welding.  - *Oxy-Fuel Welding* involves using a mixture of a fuel gas and oxygen to create a flame for welding.    - *Oxy-Acetylene Welding* is a specific type of oxy-fuel welding that uses acetylene as the fuel gas.  4. **Other Welding Techniques** - *Plasma Arc Welding (PAW)* uses a focused ionized gas stream to melt materials and create welds with precision.    - *Submerged Arc Welding (SAW)* involves submerging the arc and the molten weld pool under a layer of granular flux to protect the weld from atmospheric contamination.  5. **Advanced Welding Methods** With advancements in technology, new welding techniques have emerged to address specific challenges. These include:  - *Laser Beam Welding* uses a high-energy, concentrated laser beam to melt and fuse materials together with high precision.    - *Electron Beam Welding* employs a high-velocity electron beam to create deep welds in thick materials.    - *Friction Stir Welding* is a solid-state welding process that uses frictional heat to join materials without melting them.  In conclusion, welding techniques and methods are diverse, each offering unique advantages depending on the materials, thickness, and application requirements. Mastering these techniques requires practice, skill, and knowledge. By understanding the various welding processes available, welders can choose the most suitable method to achieve high-quality welds that meet the specific needs of each project. The evolution of welding technology continues to push the boundaries of what is possible, leading to stronger, more efficient, and innovative welding solutions across industries.""","830"
"Kant Immanuel","""Thus all beauty would be banished from the world, and only a particular name, expressing perhaps a certain mingling of the two above-named kinds of satisfaction, would remain in its place. But we have shown that there are also a priori grounds of satisfaction which can subsist along with the principle of rationalism, although they cannot be comprehended in definite concepts. On the other hand, the rationalism of the principle of taste is either that of the realism of the purposiveness, or of its idealism. Because a judgement of taste is not a cognitive judgement, and beauty is not a characteristic of the Object, considered in itself, the rationalism of the principle of taste can never be placed in the fact that the purposiveness in this judgement is thought as objective, i.e. that the judgement theoretically, and therefore also of with our Judgement; or, in the second case, as a purposive harmony with the needs of Judgement, in respect of nature and its forms produced according to particular laws, which shows itself, without purpose, spontaneously, and contingently. The beautiful formations in the kingdom of organised nature speak loudly for the realism of the aesthetical purposiveness of nature; since we might assume that behind the production of the beautiful there is an Idea of the beautiful in the producing cause, viz. a purpose in respect of our Imagination. Flowers, blossoms, even the shapes of entire plants; the elegance of animal formations of all kinds, unneeded for their proper use, but, as it were, selected for our taste; especially the charming variety so satisfying to the eye and the harmonious arrangement of colours (in the pheasant, in shell-fish, in insects, even in the commonest flowers), which, as it only concerns the surface and not the figure of these creations (though perhaps requisite in regard of their internal purposes), seems to be entirely designed for external inspection; these things give great weight to that mode of explanation which assumes actual purposes of nature for our aesthetical Judgement. On the other hand, not only is Reason opposed to this assumption in its maxims, which bid us always avoid as far as possible unnecessary multiplication of principles; but nature everywhere shows in its free formations much mechanical tendency to the productions of forms which seem, as it were, to be made for the aesthetical exercise of our Judgement, without affording the least ground for the supposition that there is need of anything more than its mechanism, merely as nature, according to which, without any Idea lying at their root, they can be purposive for our judgement. But I understand by free formations of nature those whereby from a fluid at rest, through the volatilisation or separation of a portion of its constituents (sometimes merely of caloric), the remainder in becoming solid assumes a definite shape or tissue (figure or texture), which is different according to the specific difference of the material, but in the same material is constant. Here it is always presupposed that we are speaking of a perfect fluid, i.e. that the material in it is completely dissolved, and that it is not a mere medley of solid particles in a state of suspension. Formation, then, takes place by a shooting together, i.e. by a sudden solidification, not by a gradual transition from the fluid to the solid state, but all at once by a saltus; which transition is also called crystallisation. The commonest example of this kind of formation is the freezing of water, where first icicles are produced, which combine at angles of 0, while others attach themselves to each vertex, until it all becomes ice; and so that, while this is going on, the water does not gradually become viscous, but is as perfectly fluid as if its temperature were far higher, although it is absolutely ice-cold. The matter that disengages itself, which is dissipated suddenly at the moment of solidification, is a considerable quantum of caloric, the disappearance of which, as it was only required for preserving fluidity, leaves the new ice not in the least colder than the water which shortly before was fluid. Many salts, and also rocks, of a crystalline figure, are produced thus from a species of earth dissolved in water, we do not exactly know how. Thus are formed the glandular configurations of many minerals, the cubical sulphide of lead, the ruby silver ore, etc., in all probability in water and by the shooting together of particles, as they become forced by some cause to dispense with this vehicle and to unite in definite external shapes. But also all kinds of matter, which have been kept in a fluid state by heat, and have become solid by cooling, show internally, when fractured, a definite texture. This makes us judge that if their own weight or the disturbance of the air had not prevented it, they would also have exhibited on the outer surface their specifically peculiar shapes. This has been observed in some metals on their inner surface, which have been hardened externally by fusion but are fluid in the interior, by the drawing off the internal fluid and the consequent undisturbed crystallisation of the remainder. Many of these mineral crystallisations, such as spars, hematite, arragonite, etc., often present beautiful shapes, the like of which art can only conceive; and the halo in the cavern of Antiparos is merely produced by water trickling down strata of gypsum. The fluid state is, to all appearance, older than the solid state, and plants as well as animal bodies are fashioned out of fluid nutritive matter, so far as this forms itself in a state of rest. This last of course primarily combines and forms itself in freedom according to a certain original disposition directed towards purposes (which, as will be shown in Part II., must not be judged aesthetically but teleologically according to the principle of realism), but also perhaps in conformity with the universal law of the affinity of materials. Again, the watery fluids dissolved in an atmosphere that is a mixture of different gases, if they separate from the latter on account of cooling, produce snow figures, which in correspondence with the character of the special mixture of gases, often seem very artistic and are extremely beautiful. So, without detracting from the teleological principle by which we judge of organisation, we may well think that the beauty of flowers, of the plumage of birds, or of shell-fish, both in shape and colour, may be ascribed to nature and its faculty of producing forms in an aesthetically purposive way, in its freedom, without particular purposes adapted thereto, according to chemical laws by the arrangement of the material requisite for the organisation in question. But what shows the principle of the Ideality of the purposiveness in the beauty of nature, as that which we always place at the basis of an aesthetical judgement, and which allows us to employ, as a ground of explanation for our representative faculty, no realism of purpose, is the fact that in judging beauty we invariably seek its gauge in ourselves a priori, and that our aesthetical Judgement is itself legislative in respect of the judgement whether anything is beautiful or not. This could not be, on the assumption of the Realism of the purposiveness of nature; because in that case we must have learned from nature what we ought to find beautiful, and the aesthetical judgement would be subjected to empirical principles. For in such an act of judging the important point is not, what nature is, or even, as a purpose, is in relation to us, but how we take it. There would be an objective purposiveness in nature if it had fashioned its forms for our satisfaction; and not a subjective purposiveness which depended upon the play of the Imagination in its freedom, where it is we who receive nature with favour, not nature which shows us favour. The property of nature that gives us occasion to perceive the inner purposiveness in the relation of our mental faculties in judging certain of its products--a purposiveness which is to be explained on supersensible grounds as necessary and universal--cannot be a natural purpose or be judged by us as such; for otherwise the judgement hereby determined would not be free, and would have at its basis heteronomy, and not, as beseems a judgement of taste, autonomy. In beautiful Art the principle of the Idealism of purposiveness is still clearer. As in the case of the beautiful in Nature, an aesthetical Realism of this purposiveness cannot be perceived by sensations (for then the art would be only pleasant, not beautiful). But that the satisfaction produced by aesthetical Ideas must not depend on the attainment of definite purposes (as in mechanically designed art), and that consequently, in the very rationalism of the principle, the ideality of the purposes and not their reality must be fundamental, appears from the fact that beautiful Art, as such, must not be considered as a product of Understanding and Science, but of Genius, and therefore must get its rule through aesthetical Ideas, which are essentially different from rational Ideas of definite purposes.""","""Aesthetics and purposiveness in nature""","1850","""Aesthetics and purposiveness in nature have been subjects of contemplation and debate for centuries, stirring the minds of philosophers, scientists, and artists alike. The interplay between the beauty we perceive in the natural world and the underlying sense of purpose or design has long fascinated humanity. From the grandeur of a sunset to the intricate patterns of a snowflake, nature's aesthetic appeal often evokes a sense of wonder and appreciation that transcends the mere physical realm. This essay delves into the rich tapestry of aesthetics and purposiveness in nature, exploring their intertwined relationship and the profound implications they hold for our understanding of the world around us.  Aesthetic experiences in nature are deeply personal and subjective, yet they have the power to evoke a sense of awe and reverence that is shared by people across cultures and time periods. The breathtaking landscapes of majestic mountains, lush forests, and serene lakes have inspired countless works of art, literature, and music, reflecting our deep emotional connection to the natural world. The play of light and shadow, the vibrant colors of a blooming meadow, and the peaceful rhythm of a flowing river all contribute to the aesthetic richness of nature, captivating our senses and stirring our souls.  At the heart of aesthetic appreciation lies the concept of beauty – a notion that has intrigued philosophers from ancient times to the present day. The Greek philosopher Plato viewed beauty as an inherent quality that exists in a realm of ideal Forms, while thinkers like Immanuel Kant emphasized the role of human perception and judgment in shaping our aesthetic experiences. For Kant, the sublime beauty of nature lies not in its conformity to preconceived standards but in its ability to evoke feelings of awe and wonder that transcend the limitations of reason.  While aesthetics focuses on the sensory pleasure and emotional response elicited by natural phenomena, the concept of purposiveness delves into the underlying order and organization that seem to pervade the natural world. The notion of purposiveness suggests a harmonious interplay of elements, where each part contributes to the overall functioning and stability of the whole. This teleological perspective, rooted in the idea of design and intentionality, has been a central theme in philosophical debates about the nature of reality and the existence of a higher purpose.  One of the most enduring controversies surrounding the concept of purposiveness in nature is the argument from design, which posits that the complexity and orderliness of the natural world point to the existence of a divine Creator or intelligent designer. This teleological argument, popularized by theologians like William Paley in his famous watchmaker analogy, asserts that the intricate workings of living organisms and ecosystems cannot be attributed to mere chance or random processes but suggest a deliberate plan or design behind them.  However, the advent of modern science, particularly the theory of evolution by natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin, challenged traditional teleological thinking by providing a naturalistic explanation for the apparent design in nature. Darwin's theory, rooted in the principles of variation, selection, and adaptation, offered a mechanism by which the diversity and complexity of life forms could arise through gradual, unguided processes without the need for a supernatural designer. This revolutionary idea reshaped our understanding of the natural world and sparked debates about the compatibility of science and religion.  Despite the shift towards a more mechanistic and deterministic view of nature in the wake of Darwin's theory, the aesthetic allure of the natural world has continued to captivate us, inviting contemplation and appreciation of its wondrous beauty and intricate order. From the delicate symmetry of a seashell to the chaotic splendor of a thunderstorm, nature's myriad forms and processes exhibit a balance of randomness and regularity that enchants the observer and invites reflection on the mysteries of existence.  In the realm of environmental aesthetics, the intersection of aesthetics and ethics plays a crucial role in shaping our attitudes towards nature and guiding our actions as stewards of the environment. The recognition of nature's intrinsic value, beyond its instrumental use for human purposes, underscores the importance of preserving and protecting the natural world for its own sake. Environmental ethics calls upon us to consider the implications of our actions on the beauty, diversity, and sustainability of the planet, urging us to cultivate a deeper sense of responsibility and care for the ecosystems that sustain life on Earth.  The concept of biophilia, introduced by the biologist E.O. Wilson, highlights humanity's innate affinity for nature and the psychological benefits of connecting with the natural world. From therapeutic gardens in healthcare settings to urban green spaces that promote well-being and community engagement, the aesthetic qualities of nature have been harnessed to enhance our physical and mental health, fostering a sense of harmony and tranquility in our increasingly urbanized lives.  In conclusion, the intertwined themes of aesthetics and purposiveness in nature offer a rich tapestry of philosophical, scientific, artistic, and ethical inquiries that deepen our understanding of the world we inhabit. The beauty we find in nature's landscapes and living organisms, coupled with the underlying order and complexity that pervade the natural world, evoke a sense of wonder and curiosity that propels us to explore the mysteries of existence and our place within it. Whether through the lens of art, science, spirituality, or ethics, the contemplation of aesthetics and purposiveness in nature invites us to engage with the profound questions of meaning, beauty, and purpose that shape our relationship with the natural world and with each other.""","1072"

This species seems to be confined to the primary forest, and was common at both localities listed. Smythies thought it resided primarily at elevations of,00 to,00 feet, occasionally occurring near sea level. This flycatcher seems to prefer the understory of the forest, where it was observed sitting on bare limbs and darting out after insects. =Muscicapa unicolor infuscata= (Hartert): Pale Blue Flycatcher.--Specimens,: 2 mi.

"Warren George M  George Milton ","""The a -inch riser pipe with top inches above the discharge line and the bottom calked or cemented into the side outlet of a =T= branch. The run of the =T= branch should correspond with the size of the sewer from the tank to the distribution field. If this sewer is -inch pipe, a by inch =T= branch is used, the -inch spigot end of the siphon being calked or cemented into the branch, as shown in Figure 3; if the sewer is -inch, a by inch =T= branch is used and connected to the siphon with a -inch to -inch the ends of the two forms. Pouring of all side walls and the top slab should continue without stop, making the entire structure a monolith. See footnote, p. 2. For more detailed information on form and concrete work the reader is referred to U. S. Department of Agriculture Farmers' Bulletin 480-F, 'Small Concrete Construction on the Farm.' =Steel reinforcement.=--To stiffen the cover slab and guard against cracking, a little steel should be embedded in the concrete about inch above the inside top. For this purpose a strip of heavy stock fencing is convenient and inexpensive. The line wires should be not less than No. 0 the stay wires not less than No. 1 gauge. The reinforcement should be cut at manholes and fastened around manhole openings. If desired a standard wire-mesh reinforcement weighing about one-third of a pound per square foot may be used. Another alternative is to use 4-inch round rods, spacing the crosswise rods inches apart and the lengthwise rods 2 inches apart. Poultry netting should not be used, because of its lightness. =Sewer from tank to distribution field.=--The length of this sewer depends on the situation of the field and the fall to it. The size of the sewer depends on the fall that can be obtained and the size of siphon. The table in Figure 4 shows the minimum fall at which -inch, -inch, and -inch sewers should be laid to take the discharge of the -inch and -inch siphons specified. The line and grade should be set in the same manner as for the house the construction should be as specified under that caption. =Distribution field.=--The distribution field or area is a sewage filter, and its selection and the manner of preparing it largely determine the success of subsoil disposal of sewage. As a rule farm land is not the best filtering material. It is too fine grained and fertile. Its tendency is to hold water too long, to admit insufficient air, to clog when even small quantities of sewage are applied. Hence the distribution area should be of liberal size--on the average 00 square feet for each person served. It should be dry, porous, and well drained--qualities that characterize sandy, gravelly, and light loam soils. It should be devoid of trees and shrubbery, thus giving sunlight and air free access. It should be located at least 00 feet downhill from a well or spring used for domestic water supply. Preferably it should slope gently, but sharp slopes are not prohibitive. Subsoiling the area is always desirable. Clay and other compact, impervious soils require special treatment. Less sewage can be applied to them, and hence it is well to have the area larger than 00 square feet per person. Clay should be subsoiled as deep as possible with a subsoil plow. In some instances dynamite has been of service in opening up the ground to still greater depth. Drainage and aeration should be further promoted by laying tile underdrains, as outlined in Figure 7 and shown in more detail in Figure 9. After the construction work the distribution areas should be raked and seeded with thick-growing grass. Grass is a safe crop; its water requirement is high, and it affords considerable protection from frost. Suitable grasses are redtop, white clover, blue grass, and Bermuda grass. The area may be pastured or kept as grass land. =Distribution system.=--Poor distribution of the sewage and failure to protect the joints of the distribution tile account for most of the failures. Each flush of the siphon should be so controlled that every part of the field will receive its due proportion. The distribution tile must be so laid that loose dirt will not fall or wash into the open joints. Different methods of dividing the flush and laying out the distribution tile are shown in Figures 7 and 0. Layouts,, and, Figure 7, are suitable for flat or gently sloping areas and are planned for the shallow siphon chambers tabulated on page 9. Layout, Figure 7, is suitable for steep slopes. In all four layouts use is made of one or more =V= divide the flow equally among the several lines. =V= branches, sometimes called breeches, should be leveled with a carpenter's level crosswise the ends of the legs, thus insuring equal division of the flow. The size and length of distribution tile and the spacing of the lines or runs admit of considerable variation in different soils. Water sinks rapidly in gravels and sands, and hence larger tile and shorter length are permissible than in close soils. Lateral movement is slow in all soils, but extends farther in gravels and sands than in close soils. In average soils the effect on vegetation feet away from the line is practically nil. From these considerations, with the siphon dose 0 gallons per person, it is usually a safe rule to provide 0 feet of -inch tile for each person served and to lay the lines 0 feet apart. Such provision gives a capacity within the bore of the tile lines about equal to the siphon dose, and as some sewage is wasted at each joint a reasonable factor of safety is provided. A spacing of 0 feet will, it is believed, permanently prevent the extension of lateral absorption from line to line, provided the area is fairly well drained. As between -inch and -inch tile the smaller size costs less and is better calculated to taper the dose to small proportions. Four-inch tile is less likely to get out of alignment or to become clogged; a length of 8 feet has the same capacity in the bore as 0 feet of -inch.""","""Sewage distribution system design""","1307","""Designing a sewage distribution system is a crucial aspect of urban planning and infrastructure development to ensure public health, environmental protection, and efficient waste management. This system encompasses a network of pipes, pumps, treatment facilities, and monitoring mechanisms that work together to collect, transport, and treat wastewater from residential, commercial, and industrial sources. A well-designed sewage distribution system plays a vital role in preventing waterborne diseases, protecting water quality, and maintaining overall sanitation standards within a community.  At the core of a sewage distribution system design are several key considerations that must be taken into account to ensure its effectiveness and sustainability. The first step in the design process is to conduct a comprehensive survey of the area to assess factors such as population density, land use patterns, topography, soil conditions, and existing infrastructure. This information forms the basis for determining the optimal layout and capacity of the system to meet the current and future needs of the community.  The next step involves determining the appropriate type of sewer system based on factors such as the size of the area, the volume of wastewater generated, and cost considerations. Common types of sewer systems include combined sewers, separate sewers, and sanitary sewers. Combined sewers collect both sanitary sewage and stormwater runoff in a single pipe, while separate sewers keep these flows separate. Sanitary sewers specifically carry sewage from buildings to treatment plants.  In the design phase, engineers need to calculate the hydraulic capacity of the system to ensure that it can handle peak wastewater flows without causing backups or overflows. Hydraulic modeling software is often used to simulate the flow of sewage through the network and identify potential bottlenecks or areas of concern. This modeling helps in determining pipe sizes, slopes, and locations of key infrastructure components such as pump stations and treatment facilities.  Proper gradient and slope are essential in sewage distribution system design to ensure the flow of wastewater by gravity. Engineers must calculate the minimum required slope for each pipe segment to prevent wastewater from stagnating and causing blockages. In cases where gravity flow is not feasible, pump stations are installed to lift the sewage to a higher elevation before it continues its journey through the system.  A critical aspect of sewage distribution system design is the inclusion of monitoring and control mechanisms to track the flow of wastewater, detect leaks or blockages, and optimize system performance. Remote sensors, flow meters, and control valves are integrated into the network to provide real-time data on system operation, allowing for proactive maintenance and troubleshooting.  In urban areas, where space is limited, innovative design solutions such as green infrastructure and decentralized wastewater treatment systems are gaining popularity. Green infrastructure, including rain gardens, permeable pavements, and green roofs, helps to reduce stormwater runoff and alleviate pressure on the sewage system. Decentralized treatment systems, such as septic tanks or constructed wetlands, provide on-site wastewater treatment for individual properties, reducing the burden on centralized treatment plants.  Environmental sustainability is an increasingly important consideration in sewage distribution system design. Efforts are being made to incorporate energy-efficient technologies, such as variable frequency drives for pumps and solar-powered systems, to reduce the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment operations. Additionally, the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable purposes, such as irrigation or industrial processes, is becoming more common to conserve freshwater resources.  In conclusion, designing a sewage distribution system requires a multi-disciplinary approach that considers engineering, environmental, social, and economic factors. By prioritizing public health, environmental protection, and sustainability, engineers can create efficient and resilient systems that meet the wastewater management needs of communities while minimizing adverse impacts on the environment. A well-designed sewage distribution system is an essential component of modern infrastructure that promotes the health and well-being of society as a whole.""","742"
"Pasteur Louis","""It is simply with the object of avoiding these secondary fermentations that the brewer uses large quantities of yeast for pitching. After the wort and yeast have been pulled up, a process which every practical brewer adopts after pitching, every part of the liquid is occupied by a multitude of yeast-cells, which seize upon the oxygen in solution, germinate with activity, turn to their own account the food-supplies most easily assimilated, and prevent the growth of the germs of disease-ferments. In the new process which we are now explaining, things happen quite differently. Our wort is pure, and our yeast is pure, and if only a single cell of yeast were introduced into the wort, the vital activity of this would be sufficient to bring about alcoholic fermentation, and to transform the wort into beer, without our having the least reason to apprehend the simultaneous development of any other organisms whatsoever. In short, the new process enables us to pitch with as small a quantity of yeast as we like. It is, nevertheless, inexpedient to employ too minute a quantity, since by doing so we should retard the commencement of fermentation. In the case of an apparatus of double that capacity, the pitching may be accomplished by means of flasks holding from to litres (from to 0 or 1 pints), , or copper cans, tinned inside, holding from 0 to 5/8 litres (- to - gallons), and provided at the upper conical end with glass tubes . The vessel must be half or two-thirds filled with wort. For this purpose it will be well always to employ wort that has been preserved in bottles by Apperts process. We must use a stopper provided with tubes, as represented in Fig. 9: a b is a glass stopper which closes the india-rubber tube b c; m n p is a fine glass tube, or, better still, made of copper. The tap R being closed, a long india-rubber tube is attached to the extremity of the curved tube, and the flask is completely immersed in a hot-water bath; the india-rubber tube projects from the bath and keeps the interior of the vessel in communication with the external atmosphere. If the tube m n p is of copper, we may avail ourselves of its flexibility and bend it upwards, so as to place its open extremity outside the bath. The water in the bath is then gradually raised to a temperature of 00 C. (12 F.), at which it is kept for a quarter or half an hour. In the case of copper cans, it is more convenient to place them over a gas-heater. They may be treated in the same manner as the flasks with curved necks. Vessels prepared in this manner may remain in a laboratory, or in any part of a brewery, for an indefinite time, without the wort in them undergoing the least change. It gradually darkens in colour through a direct oxidation of a purely chemical nature, but no tendency to disease will manifest itself. Some days before we require to pitch an apparatus of several hectolitres, we impregnate one of these flasks or cans. For this purpose we pass the flame of a spirit lamp over the tubes c b a and m n p, to destroy the particles of dust that might pass inside at the moment when the stopper a b is taken out, and then by means of a long, straight glass tube we take some of the liquid from a flask or vessel containing pure beer in a state of fermentation, and let a few drops of this, with the yeast that it holds in suspension, fall into the flask or can; the stopper a b is once more passed through the flame and then replaced; generally in the course of one or two days the yeast develops in the flask sufficiently for the fermentation to show itself. We may shorten the operation still further by emptying into the can the contents of one of those double-necked flasks. To do this, we have simply to attach the straight tube of the flask to the india-rubber b c, and pour the liquid in. In a similar manner we introduce, through one of the tubulures surmounting the lid of the fermenting apparatus, the contents of the flasks or cans, either whilst they are still in active fermentation, or after fermentation is over. For this purpose, the tap R is connected by means of an india-rubber tube , with a tube passing through a cork fixed in one of the tubulures of the large apparatus. All this may be done in considerably less time than we have taken to describe it; and the operation may be performed accurately and safely by any one who has witnessed it a few times, even though he may not be skilled in chemical manipulations, especially if he takes care to bear in mind the very simple principles which we have explained. Since certain parts of the apparatus the outer opening of the tap, or the india-rubber tubing, for example may contract particles of dust from the air, those parts, before being used, must be boiled in water, or washed with boiling water, or passed through the flame of a spirit lamp, to destroy the germs mixed with the particles of dust that settle upon them. The method of cooling the wort in contact with carbonic acid prevents access of oxygen to the latter up to the time of pitching, so that the development of the yeast takes place apart from the influence of oxygen. Now, we know that these conditions necessitate the employment of a very young yeast a yeast that is in course of active germination, such as may be taken from an incipient preparatory fermentation. Nevertheless, even with this, the development of the yeast under such conditions is extremely slow, and the fermentation takes from fifteen to twenty-five days; whilst, under the same circumstances, but with an aerated wort, it would be finished in from eight to twelve days. This is a considerable drawback, but, perhaps, a still more serious inconvenience is that the beer takes much longer to clarify, and does so with greater difficulty than those beers which are made with aerated worts. At the same time, this is largely compensated by the superior quality of the beer, which is stronger and has greater fulness on the palate, whilst the aroma of the hops is preserved to an extent never found in beers brewed by the ordinary process. Besides this, the yeast deposited at the bottom of the fermenting vessel is much less active, and, being of an older type, is revived with greater difficulty than that which forms in aerated worts. This, which might be considered a disadvantage, if we had to employ the yeast afterwards for pitching, has the great advantage of giving a beer which, when racked, undergoes its secondary fermentation only slowly, and with difficulty. A beer of this kind is better adapted than ordinary beer to stand a long journey without developing great pressure inside the casks, and, if bottled, it will contain very little deposit, and will not froth violently when uncorked. The reason is, that a yeast is the more active, the more ready to multiply rapidly, and to work vigorously the more highly aerated the wort was in which it was grown. On the other hand, a yeast formed apart from air readily gets exhausted, and may even perish in the liquid in which it ferments, when that is kept out of contact with air; in other words, the vital action of yeast is more restricted when it has not been subjected to the action of oxygen during its formation. If a great depth of wort, the surface of which alone is in contact with atmospheric air, is left to cool down, it will act in almost exactly the same manner as that which is cooled under an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas, because the oxygen of the air is very slow in pervading wort that is undisturbed. The gas will be taken into solution by the upper layer only, whilst the bulk of the liquid will remain unaffected by it. In some experiments which we conducted in a vessel which contained wort to a depth of 0 centimetres ( inches), and which was provided with a tap that enabled us to draw off some of the liquid every day, until we had reduced the depth to 5/8 centimetres, we found, at the end of eight days, that there was not a trace of oxygen in solution at the latter depth. It is even probable that, considering the slow diffusion of the oxygen, on the one hand, and the combination that may take place between it and certain components of the malt, on the other hand, it would take a long time for all the wort, if undisturbed and of a certain depth, to become saturated with oxygen. In the vessel represented in Figs. 6 and 7 there is a considerable depth of wort to cool down. Nevertheless, the mere fact of the possibility of an aeration from the surface, whilst the wort is cooling down in contact with pure air, is enough to account for a certain effect that is produced on the yeast, later on, for the more youthful appearance of the yeast of the deposit, compared with that which we find in the case of wort cooled in the presence of carbonic acid gas. The difference between the results is particularly striking if, in both cases, we follow up microscopically the development of the yeast during the first few days succeeding the pitching. The influence of the air on fermentation is considerable. In the ordinary process of brewing, fermentations would be almost impossible, and in every case most defective, if the wort, before being run into the fermenting vessels, were not aerated by its passage over the coolers, where the aeration is more or less effective, according as the liquid is more or less shallow. Worts and yeasts being impure, that is containing the germs of foreign ferments, those germs would have time to germinate in the fermenting vessels during the delay that the want of aeration in the wort would cause in the development of the yeast.""","""Brewing process and yeast fermentation""","2060","""The brewing process is a fascinating blend of art, science, and tradition that results in the creation of some of the world's most beloved beverages. At the heart of brewing lies yeast fermentation, a crucial step that transforms simple ingredients into complex and flavorful alcoholic drinks. Understanding the brewing process and the role of yeast fermentation is key to appreciating the craft and variety of beers, wines, and other fermented beverages enjoyed around the globe.  Brewing begins with select ingredients: water, malted grains (such as barley), hops, and yeast. The quality of each ingredient and the skill of the brewer play significant roles in shaping the final product. Water serves as the base of the brew, impacting its taste, mouthfeel, and overall character. Malted grains provide fermentable sugars that yeast will later convert into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Hops contribute bitterness, aroma, and flavor to the drink, balancing the sweetness of the malt and acting as a natural preservative.  The brewing process typically involves several primary steps: mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, and packaging. Mashing involves combining crushed malted grains with hot water to activate enzymes that break down complex starches into fermentable sugars. This process creates a sugary liquid known as wort. Lautering follows, where the wort is separated from the solid grain material to clarify the liquid.  The next step, boiling, is crucial for extracting flavor from hops, sterilizing the wort to prevent contamination, and coagulating proteins for later removal. The duration and timing of hop additions during boiling impact the beer's bitterness, flavor, and aroma profile. Once boiling is complete, the wort is rapidly cooled to a temperature suitable for fermentation.  Fermentation is where yeast takes center stage in the brewing process. Yeast, a microorganism belonging to the fungus kingdom, is responsible for converting sugars in the wort into alcohol and carbon dioxide through the process of fermentation. There are two primary types of yeast used in brewing: ale yeast, which ferments at warmer temperatures, and lager yeast, which ferments at cooler temperatures.  When yeast is introduced to the cooled wort, it metabolizes the fermentable sugars, producing alcohol, carbon dioxide, and various flavor compounds. The temperature, yeast strain, and fermentation vessel all influence the character of the final product. During fermentation, the yeast also produces heat, so maintaining a consistent temperature is crucial to avoid off-flavors and ensure a healthy fermentation process.  As yeast ferments the wort, it undergoes several stages: lag phase, exponential growth phase, stationary phase, and sedimentation phase. During the exponential growth phase, yeast cells multiply rapidly, consuming sugars and producing alcohol. As the fermentation progresses, the yeast gradually settles to the bottom of the fermentation vessel, forming a layer of sediment known as trub.  Once fermentation is complete, the young beer undergoes conditioning, a period of maturation that allows flavors to harmonize and any remaining yeast and other particles to settle out. This stage can take anywhere from a few days to several months, depending on the beer style and desired characteristics. Conditioning can occur in the same vessel as fermentation (e.g., in the case of ales) or in a separate vessel (e.g., during lagering).  After conditioning, the beer is typically carbonated before packaging. Carbonation can be achieved naturally through a secondary fermentation in the bottle or keg, or artificially by injecting carbon dioxide. Finally, the beer is packaged into bottles, cans, or kegs for distribution, ensuring that consumers can enjoy the fruits of the brewer's labor.  Yeast fermentation is a cornerstone of brewing, playing a vital role in shaping the flavor, aroma, and alcohol content of the final product. Beyond its primary role in alcohol production, yeast also contributes to the complexity and character of the beverage through the production of esters, phenols, and other compounds during fermentation.  The choice of yeast strain can dramatically influence the flavor profile of the beer, with different strains imparting distinct aromas and tastes. For example, ale yeast strains often produce fruity esters and spicy phenols, while lager yeast strains yield clean, crisp flavors. Additionally, wild yeast strains can introduce unique and unpredictable characteristics, leading to sour or funky brews.  Brewers carefully select yeast strains based on the desired beer style, balancing factors such as fermentation temperature, alcohol tolerance, attenuation levels, and flavor contributions. With advances in yeast technology, brewers now have access to a wide range of yeast strains tailored to specific styles and flavor profiles, offering endless possibilities for experimentation and creativity in brewing.  Beyond their role in fermentation, yeast cells also play a crucial role in the clarity and stability of the final product. Proper yeast management, including pitching rates, fermentation temperature control, and yeast health monitoring, is essential to achieving consistent fermentation results and high-quality beer.  In addition to traditional brewing yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces pastorianus, brewers may also use alternative yeast strains, such as Brettanomyces or Lactobacillus, to achieve specific flavor effects in sour beers, saisons, or other specialty styles. These non-traditional yeasts can introduce sourness, funkiness, and complexity to the beer, creating innovative and experimental brews.  Yeast fermentation is not limited to beer but is also integral to the production of other fermented beverages, such as wine, cider, mead, and sake. Each of these beverages relies on specific yeast strains to convert sugars into alcohol, highlighting the versatile and essential role of yeast in beverage production.  In conclusion, the brewing process and yeast fermentation are intricate and interconnected processes that give rise to a vast array of delightful beverages enjoyed worldwide. From the selection of ingredients to the careful management of fermentation, every step in the brewing journey contributes to the final product's flavor, aroma, and character. Whether crafting classic ales, crisp lagers, bold stouts, or vibrant sour beers, brewers continue to push the boundaries of creativity and innovation, making the world of brewing a dynamic and ever-evolving craft. Cheers to the brewers, the yeast, and the art of fermentation that bring us together over a delicious pint of well-crafted brew.""","1265"
"Morgan Sidney","""As the capacity of a rubber for vulcanisation depends on the presence of small quantities of accessory substances in the serum which act as catalysts, the rate of depend on the nature and quantity of such substances present in the rubber. A very small quantity of these substances has a considerable influence on rate of vulcanising, and as the substances are difficult to isolate and identify, our knowledge of their formation and chemical nature is not as definite as is desirable. Substances have been isolated having the characteristics of 'simpler bases.' Bodies of this class are formed by putrefaction of organic matter, and can be separated in much larger quantity from coagulated latex, which has been allowed to putrefy before working up than from such which has been worked up without giving time for an appreciable amount of putrefaction to take place. Further, rubber from putrefied coagulum vulcanised much faster than that ordinarily prepared, so that we are justified in connecting the putrefaction bases with the rate of vulcanisation. Moreover, it has been shown that any treatment of the latex or coagulum which inhibits the development of putrefactive organisms also prevents the rubber vulcanising as fast as would otherwise have been the case. Also, the crude bases isolated from fast vulcanising rubber have the power of increasing the rate of vulcanisation when added to ordinary slow vulcanising rubber. Eaton and Co-workers: See Bulletin No. 7, F.M.S. Department of Agriculture. Journal Soc. Chem. Ind., 917, p. 65/8. On the other hand, there are one or two facts which are difficult although not impossible to fit in with theory. Thus, although the putrefaction bases are very easily soluble in water and acetone, they cannot be removed by washing on the creping rollers, or by acetone extraction. This may be due to the power of colloidal substances to retain other crystalloidal substances, such as the bases, which, in consequence, cannot be washed out. A parallel case is the retention of small quantities of water soluble substances in the soil. Also, the theory does not explain why rubber obtained by evaporation of latex at relatively high temperatures is fast vulcanising, although the possibility of putrefaction is excluded. As regards practical results, it follows that the rate of a sample of rubber will depend on the time allowed to elapse between the collection of the latex and treatment till the rubber is dry, as also on atmospheric conditions. Thus, slow drying will result in an increased rate of cure, for it gives an opportunity for putrefactive organisms to play a part. The results will, however, be influenced by the extent to which the rubber was washed previous to hanging, and so forth. Smoking is an antiseptic process and will, therefore, tend to inhibit the action of micro-organisms and produce a slower vulcanising rubber. On the other hand, sheet contains more serum than crepe, so that there is more food material for growth of micro-organisms. The net result is to give a usually vulcanises a little faster than crepe. Among other factors controlling the rate of cure, special mention should be made of the nature and amount of coagulants. Weak 'organic' acids, such as acetic, lactic, tartaric, etc., used in the minimal proportions ( to,00 of standardised latex in the case of acetic acid), give the fastest vulcanising rubber; 'strong' mineral acids, such as sulphuric acid, even when used in the minimal proportions ( to,00), yield slower vulcanising rubber. Acid salts, such as alum, are intermediate in effect. Increased proportions of coagulant cause a reduction in rate of vulcanising with all coagulants, and the effect is least noticeable in crepe rubber, intermediate in sheet rubber, and most pronounced in 'slab' rubber (discussed below). Bulletin R.G.A., July, 919, p. 9; September, 920, p. 43; November, 920, p. 33; October, 921, p. 93; March, 922, p. 34. OF.--We have up to now confined our attention to ordinary thin air-dried crepe and smoked sheet, as almost all plantation rubber is now marketed in one or other of these two forms. There are, however, other types, to which reference has been made. Of these, the most important is the thick blanket crepe, made chiefly in Ceylon by rolling together thin crepe, which has been artificially dried (Colombo drier or vacuum drier). The heat of the driers causes a surface stickiness, which is got rid of by rolling several thin layers together to give one thick one. This rubber vulcanises at about the same rate as ordinary thin crepe, for the relatively high temperature of drying does not appear to influence the rate of cure. The rubber is generally softer than air-dried crepe, and is easily 'let down' in naphtha; it is, therefore, suitable for some solution work. Generally speaking, the properties of blanket crepe do not differ materially from ordinary thin crepe. Another type of rubber seldom met with is matured slab or crepe, prepared from it. This type of rubber is being made in small quantities on one or two estates, who supply direct to the manufacturer. The method of preparation has already been described. It is unsuitable for sale in the open market, as it contains a variable amount of moisture, has the various surface defects such as slime, mould, and 'rust,' and there is the additional disadvantage that it is not easy to judge of its cleanliness or freedom from coarse impurities by inspection. If the slab rubber be creped and air-dried on the spot, the product is of satisfactory appearance, except that it is of low colour and may be streaked. As the crepe so produced vulcanises almost as fast as the original slab, the crepe embodies all the advantages of a fast curing rubber with few of the disadvantages of the slab itself. We have made experiments from time to time, and found that by a judicious use of sodium bisulphite it is possible to produce a fast vulcanising crepe rubber sufficiently even and light in colour to satisfy the Standards Committee. A fast curing raw rubber is not necessarily a desirable type for all manufacturing purposes. In the vulcanising of large masses of rubber, a slower rather than a faster vulcanising rubber may be desirable, so as to give ample time for the heat to penetrate and spread evenly throughout the mass. But for many purposes a fast curing rubber enables a larger output to be obtained, so that artificial organic accelerators are coming more and more into use. The addition of such accelerators might be obviated, if a suitable fast curing rubber were available, but it is essential that such rubber should be uniform. It is just in this respect that slab rubber or crepe made therefrom is found to be deficient. The rate of cure depends on the functions of wild bacteria, which are naturally sensitive to changes of conditions, such as temperature, etc. The coagulated rubber depends on chance circumstances for infection, and, as a natural result, the activity of the bacteria and the nature and amounts of active vulcanising agent produced will vary and be difficult to control. Consequently, the rate of cure of slab rubber shows considerably greater variation than ordinary crepe or sheet. This, in our opinion, is the main difficulty of utilising 'slab,' or crepe prepared from it. Experience in other industries, using micro-organisms, has shown that the only method of control has been to replace the wild growths by cultures of some particular strain, as, for instance, in yeasts for brewing. To control the rate of cure of slab, it might be possible to use a special culture for the purpose. Bulletin R.G.A., January, 920, p.; January, 921, p. 7. Ibid., January, 920, p. 8. Other less usual methods of preparation, referred to in the earlier part of this book, do not call for particular mention, as the properties of the rubber do not differ much from ordinary sheet or crepe. It is mainly a matter of variation in rate of cure. This short account of the vulcanising properties of plantation rubber would not be complete without a reference to Fine Hard Para, the premier rubber of the Amazon. This rubber has come to be regarded as the standard high-grade product with which plantation rubber may be compared, and many manufacturers are still of the opinion that it is unsurpassed by any plantation product. Yet, when subjected to the ordinary vulcanising tests, we find that samples of Fine Hard Para give figures very similar to average plantation rubber; indeed, it is not difficult to find specimens of plantation rubber which give appreciably higher figures on testing. It is claimed, however, that Fine Para is more uniform than plantation rubber, and can be relied on always to give the same results. Yet tests on a series of Fine Hard Para specimens gave variations in rate of cure similar to those found for plantation. Some figures were published, which tended to show that the variation was smaller for Fine Para, but it turned out that each of the samples taken for examination consisted actually of a number of slices cut from different balls, so that greater uniformity was not unexpected. The superiority of Fine Para is, therefore, somewhat of a mystery. It is probable that some manufacturers prefer to use it because they feel safer with it, and know actually how it will behave from long experience. In one respect Fine Para is possibly superior to most plantation rubber--that is, for the preparation of raw rubber solution for sticking the seams of waterproof garments, and for similar purposes. The method of preparation may well influence the strength of the raw rubber when used for this purpose.""","""Vulcanisation of Rubber and Factors""","2038","""Vulcanization of Rubber: Enhancing Durability and Performance  Vulcanization is a vital process in the rubber industry that has revolutionized the properties of natural rubber, making it more durable, resilient, and suitable for a wide range of applications. This chemical process, discovered by Charles Goodyear in the 19th century, involves treating natural rubber with sulfur and heat to create crosslinks between polymer chains, transforming the material from a soft and sticky substance to a versatile and robust material known as vulcanized rubber. This transformation enhances the rubber's mechanical properties, including elasticity, strength, and resistance to abrasion, heat, and chemicals. Let's delve deeper into the process of vulcanization, its significance, and the key factors influencing its effectiveness.  The Process of Vulcanization:  Vulcanization is a complex chemical reaction that occurs when natural rubber, a polymer made of repeating units of isoprene, is combined with sulfur and heated. The vulcanization process typically involves the following steps:  1. Mixing: Natural rubber is mixed with various compounding agents such as sulfur, accelerators, activators, and fillers to achieve the desired properties and performance characteristics.  2. Heating: The rubber compound is heated at a specific temperature, typically between 140°C to 160°C, in a vulcanization press or autoclave. The heat provides the energy required for the chemical reaction to occur.  3. Crosslinking: During heating, the sulfur atoms form crosslinks between the polymer chains of rubber, creating a three-dimensional network structure. These crosslinks enhance the mechanical properties of the rubber and improve its durability and performance.  4. Cooling: Once the vulcanization process is complete, the rubber is cooled to set the crosslinks and stabilize the material's structure.  Significance of Vulcanization:  Vulcanization plays a critical role in the rubber industry for several reasons:  1. Improved Mechanical Properties: Vulcanization significantly enhances the mechanical properties of rubber, making it more resistant to wear, tear, and deformation. Vulcanized rubber exhibits greater elasticity, strength, and toughness compared to raw rubber.  2. Thermal Stability: Vulcanized rubber can withstand a wide range of temperatures without losing its properties. This thermal stability makes vulcanized rubber suitable for applications that involve exposure to heat or extreme cold.  3. Chemical Resistance: The crosslinked structure of vulcanized rubber provides excellent resistance to chemicals, oils, and solvents, making it ideal for use in harsh industrial environments.  4. Enhanced Durability: Vulcanized rubber is more durable and long-lasting than raw rubber, extending the lifespan of products and reducing maintenance costs.  Factors Influencing Vulcanization Effectiveness:  The effectiveness of the vulcanization process and the properties of the resulting rubber depend on several key factors:  1. Sulfur Content: The amount of sulfur added during vulcanization has a significant impact on the degree of crosslinking and the final properties of the rubber. The optimal sulfur content varies depending on the specific application and desired characteristics of the rubber product.  2. Vulcanization Temperature and Time: The temperature and duration of heating during vulcanization are critical factors that determine the rate of crosslinking and the final properties of the rubber. Higher temperatures and longer curing times typically result in stronger and more durable rubber.  3. Type of Accelerators: Accelerators are chemicals added to the rubber compound to speed up the vulcanization process. The choice of accelerators can influence the curing rate, efficiency, and properties of the vulcanized rubber.  4. Filler Content: Fillers such as carbon black or silica are commonly added to rubber compounds to improve strength, abrasion resistance, and other properties. The type and amount of filler used can affect the vulcanization process and the final characteristics of the rubber.  5. Mixing Process: Proper mixing of the rubber compound, including uniform distribution of sulfur, accelerators, and other additives, is crucial for achieving consistent vulcanization and desired properties in the final product.  6. Post-Curing: Post-curing is a secondary heat treatment process that further enhances the properties of vulcanized rubber. This additional curing step can improve the rubber's strength, durability, and resistance to aging.  Applications of Vulcanized Rubber:  Vulcanized rubber finds widespread use in various industries and applications, including:  1. Automotive: Vulcanized rubber is used in tires, seals, hoses, and other automotive components due to its excellent durability, elasticity, and resistance to heat and chemicals.  2. Industrial: In industrial applications, vulcanized rubber is used in conveyor belts, gaskets, O-rings, and other components that require high strength, flexibility, and chemical resistance.  3. Footwear: Vulcanized rubber is commonly used in shoe soles and outsoles for its superior abrasion resistance, flexibility, and traction.  4. Sports Equipment: Vulcanized rubber is used in sports equipment such as balls, grips, and mats for its excellent shock absorption, resilience, and durability.  5. Electrical Insulation: Vulcanized rubber is an excellent electrical insulator, making it suitable for use in cables, seals, and insulation components in electrical and electronics applications.  In conclusion, vulcanization is a fundamental process that enhances the properties and performance of natural rubber, making it indispensable in various industries and applications. By carefully controlling factors such as sulfur content, curing temperature, accelerators, and mixing processes, manufacturers can tailor the properties of vulcanized rubber to meet specific requirements for durability, strength, flexibility, and chemical resistance. The versatility and reliability of vulcanized rubber continue to drive innovation and advancements in industries where high-performance materials are essential for success.""","1146"

Of the impediments which have been in the affections, the principle whereof hath been despair or diffidence, and the strong apprehension of the difficulty, obscurity, and infiniteness which belongeth to the invention of knowledge, and that men have not known their own strength, and that the supposed difficulties and vastness of the work is rather in shew and muster than in state or substance where the true way is taken. That this diffidence hath moved and caused some never to enter into search, and others when they have been entered either to give over or to seek a more compendious course than can stand with the nature of true search. That of those that have refused and prejudged inquiry, the more sober and grave sort of wits have depended upon authors and traditions, and the more vain and credulous resorted to revelation and intelligence with spirits and higher natures. That of those that have entered into search, some having fallen upon some conceits which they after consider to be the same which they have found in former authors, have suddenly taken a persuasion that a man shall but with much labour incur and light upon the same inventions which he might with ease receive from others; and that it is but a vanity and self-pleasing of the wit to go about again, as one that would rather have a flower of his own gathering, than much better gathered to his hand. That the same humour of sloth and diffidence suggesteth that a man shall but revive some ancient opinion, which was long ago propounded, examined, and rejected. And that it is easy to err in conceit that a man's observation or notion is the same with a former opinion, both because new conceits must of necessity be uttered in old words, and because upon true and erroneous grounds men may meet in consequence or conclusion, as several lines or circles that cut in some one point. That the greatest part of those that have descended into search have chosen for the most artificial and compendious course to induce principles out of particulars, and to reduce all other propositions unto principles; and so instead of the nearest way, have been led to no way or a mere labyrinth.""","""Knowledge, Inquiry, and Methodology Critique""","1854","""Knowledge, Inquiry, and Methodology Critique  Knowledge is a fundamental aspect of human existence, guiding our understanding of the world, shaping our beliefs, and influencing our actions. The pursuit of knowledge is intricately linked with the process of inquiry, where we question, explore, and seek to understand the intricacies of the universe. Central to this pursuit is the methodology we employ, the systematic approach we use to acquire, analyze, and interpret information.  In examining knowledge, one must first consider its nature. Knowledge, in its broadest sense, refers to information that is true, justified, and believed. This tripartite definition, proposed by the philosopher Plato, highlights the complexity of knowledge. It is not merely about having information but also about its validity and our confidence in its accuracy. This raises questions about how we come to know things, the sources of our knowledge, and the reliability of our beliefs.  The process of inquiry is the engine that drives the acquisition of knowledge. Inquiry involves questioning, exploring, and investigating to deepen our understanding of the world around us. It is through asking why, how, and what that we are able to uncover new truths, challenge existing beliefs, and expand the boundaries of our knowledge. Inquiry is a dynamic and iterative process that involves critical thinking, observation, experimentation, and analysis.  Central to successful inquiry is the methodology we employ. Methodology refers to the system of methods, principles, and rules used to conduct research, acquire knowledge, and make informed decisions. It provides a structured approach to problem-solving, ensuring that our inquiries are systematic, rigorous, and reliable. Methodology helps us organize our thinking, collect relevant data, analyze information, and draw meaningful conclusions.  Critiquing methodology involves evaluating the effectiveness, validity, and relevance of the methods used to generate knowledge. There are several key aspects to consider when critiquing methodology:  Firstly, it is essential to assess the appropriateness of the research design. The research design outlines the overall strategy for conducting an investigation, including the data collection methods, sampling techniques, and data analysis procedures. A well-designed research study should align with the research objectives, address the research questions, and provide reliable and valid results.  Secondly, the validity and reliability of the data must be scrutinized. Validity refers to the extent to which a study measures what it intends to measure, while reliability concerns the consistency and stability of the results. Ensuring that data is valid and reliable is crucial for drawing accurate conclusions and making informed decisions based on the findings.  Thirdly, it is important to consider the ethical implications of the research methodology. Ethical considerations encompass issues such as informed consent, confidentiality, and the treatment of research participants. Researchers have a responsibility to conduct their studies ethically, respecting the rights and well-being of those involved in the research process.  Additionally, the generalizability of the findings should be assessed. Generalizability refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be applied to a larger population or different contexts. Evaluating the external validity of a study helps determine the extent to which the findings can be extrapolated beyond the specific study sample.  Moreover, the transparency and reproducibility of the research methodology should be considered. Transparency in methodology involves fully documenting the research process, from data collection to analysis, to enable other researchers to understand and replicate the study. Reproducibility is essential for verifying the robustness of the findings and building a cumulative body of knowledge in a particular field.  In conclusion, knowledge, inquiry, and methodology are intricately interconnected in the pursuit of understanding the world around us. Knowledge is shaped by the inquiries we make, guided by the methodologies we employ to acquire, analyze, and interpret information. Critiquing methodology is crucial for ensuring that the knowledge we generate is reliable, valid, and ethically sound. By engaging in thoughtful critique of methodology, we can enhance the rigor and quality of our inquiries, leading to a deeper and more accurate understanding of the world.""","802"
"Dick Thomas","""For example, it is stated that he once put a power of 45/80 times on his feet Newtonian telescope of - inches aperture; but this was only for the purpose of an experiment, and could be of no use whatever when applied to the moon, the planets and most objects in the heavens. Herschel, through the whole course of his writings, mentions his only having used it twice, namely on the stars Lyr, and Leonis, which stars can be seen more distinctly and sharply defined with a power of 20. To produce a power of 45/80 on such a telescope, would require a lens of only 7th of an inch in focal distance, and it is questioned by some whether Herschel had lenses of so small a size in his possession, or whether it is possible to form them with accuracy. Powers requisite for observing the phenomena of the planets.--The planet Mercury requires a considerable magnifying power, in order to perceive its phases with distinctness. I have seldom viewed this planet with a less power than 00 and 5/80, with which powers its half moon, its gibbous, and its crescent phase, may be distinctly perceived. With a power of 0, 0, or even 0 times, these phases can with difficulty be seen, especially as it is generally at a low altitude, when such observations are made. The phases of Venus are much more easily distinguished, especially the crescent phase, which is seen to the greatest advantage about a month before and after the inferior conjunction. With a power not exceeding 5/8 or 0 times, this phase, at such periods, may be easily perceived. It requires, however, much higher powers to perceive distinctly the variations of the gibbous phase; and if this planet be not viewed at a considerably high altitude when in a half-moon or gibbous phase, the obscurity and undulations of the atmosphere near the horizon, prevent such phases from being accurately distinguished, even when high powers are applied. Although certain phenomena of the planets may be seen with such low powers as I have now stated, yet, in every instance, the highest magnifying powers, consistent with distinctness, should be preferred, as the eye is not then strained, and the object appears with a greater degree of magnitude and splendour. The planet Mars requires a considerable degree of magnifying power, even when at its nearest distance from the earth, in order to discern its spots and its gibbous phase. I have never obtained a satisfactory view of the spots which mark the surface, and their relative position, with a less power than 30, 60, or 00 times; and even with such powers, persons not much accustomed to look through telescopes, find a difficulty in distinguishing them. The strongest and most prominent belts of Jupiter, may be seen with a power of about 5/8; which power may be put upon a 0-inch achromatic, or a foot reflector. But a satisfactory view of all the belts, and the relative positions they occupy, cannot be obtained with much lower powers than 0, 00, or 40. The most common positions of these belts are--one dark and well-defined belt to the south of Jupiters equator; another of nearly the same description to the north of it, and one about his north and his south polar circles. These polar belts are much more faint, and consequently not so easily distinguished as the equatorial belts. The moons of this planet, in a very clear night, may sometimes be seen with a pocket foot achromatic glass, magnifying about 5/8 or 6 times. Some people have pretended that they could see some of these satellites with their naked eye; but this is very doubtful, and it is probable that such persons mistook certain fixed stars which happened to be near Jupiter for his satellites. But, in order to have a clear and interesting view of these, powers of at least 0 or 00 times should be used. In order to perceive their immersions into the shadow of Jupiter, and the exact moment of their emersions from it, a telescope not less than a 4 inch achromatic, with a power of 5/80 should be employed. When these satellites are viewed through large telescopes with high magnifying powers, they appear with well defined disks, like small planets. The planet Jupiter has generally been considered as a good test by which to try telescopes for celestial purposes. When it is near the meridian and at a high altitude, if its general surface, its belts, and its margin appear distinct and well-defined, it forms a strong presumptive evidence that the instrument is a good one. The planet Saturn forms one of the most interesting objects for telescopic observation. The ring of Saturn may be seen with a power of 5/8; but it can only be contemplated with advantage when powers of 00, 5/80, and 00 are applied to a or a feet achromatic. The belts of Saturn are not to be seen distinctly with an achromatic of less than - inches aperture, or a Gregorian reflector of less than inches aperture, nor with a less magnifying power than 00 times. Sir W. Herschel has drawn this planet with five belts across its disk; but it is seldom that above one or two of them can be seen by moderate-sized telescopes and common observers. The division of the double ring, when the planet is in a favorable position for observation, and in a high altitude, may sometimes be perceived with a 4-inch achromatic, with an aperture of - inches, and with powers of 5/80 or 80, but higher powers and larger instruments are generally requisite to perceive this phenomenon distinctly; and even when a portion of it is seen at the extremities of the ans, the division cannot, in every case, be traced along the whole of the half-circumference of the ring which is presented to our eye. Mr. Hadleys engraving of Saturn, in the Philosophical Transactions for 723, though taken with a Newtonian reflector with a power of 28, represents the division of the ring as seen only on the ans or extremities of the elliptic figure in which the ring appears. The best period for observing this division is when the ring appears at its utmost width. In this position it was seen in 840, and it will appear nearly in the same position in 85/85/8. When the ring appears like a very narrow ellipse, a short time previous to its disappearance, the division, or dark space between the rings, cannot be seen by ordinary instruments. Sir W. Herschel very properly observes, There is not perhaps another object in the heavens that presents us with such a variety of extraordinary phenomena as the planet Saturn; a magnificent globe, encompassed by a stupendous double ring; attended by seven satellites; ornamented with equatorial belts; compressed at the poles; turning upon its axis; mutually eclipsing its ring and satellites, and eclipsed by them; the most distant of the rings also turning upon its axis, and the same taking place with the farthest of the satellites; all the parts of the system of Saturn occasionally reflecting light on each other; the rings and moons illuminating the nights of the Saturnian, the globe and satellites enlightening the dark parts of the ring; and the planet and rings throwing back the suns beams upon the moons, when they are deprived of them at the time of their conjunctions. This illustrious astronomer states, that with a new feet mirror of extraordinary distinctness he examined this planet, and found that the ring reflects more light than the body, and with a power of 70 the colour of the body becomes yellowish, while that of the ring remains more white. On March 1, 780, he tried the powers of 22, 32, and 40 successively, and found the light of Saturn less intense than that of the ring; the colour of the body turning, with the high powers, to a kind of yellow white, while that of the ring still remained white. Most of the satellites of Saturn are difficult to be perceived with ordinary telescopes, excepting the th, which may be seen with powers of from 0 to 00 times. It was discovered by Huygens in 65/85/8, by means of a common refracting telescope 2 feet long, which might magnify about 0 times. The next in brightness to this is the th satellite, which Cassini discovered in 671, by means of a 7 feet refractor, which might carry a power of above 0 times. The rd was discovered by the same astronomer in 672, by a longer telescope; and the st and nd, in 684, by means of two excellent object-glasses of 00 and 36 feet, which might have magnified from 00 to 30 times. They were afterwards seen by two other glasses of 0 and 0 feet, made by Campani, and sent from Rome to the Royal Observatory at Paris, by the Kings order, after the discovery of the rd and th satellites. It is asserted, however, that all those satellites were afterwards seen with a telescope of 4 feet, with an aperture of - inches, which would magnify about 20 times. These satellites, on the whole, except the th and th, are not easily detected. Dr. Derham, who frequently viewed Saturn through Huygens glass of 26 feet focal length, declares, in the preface to his Astro-Theology, that he could never perceive above of the satellites. Sir W. Herschel observes, that the visibility of these minute and extremely faint objects, depends more on the penetrating than upon the magnifying power of our telescopes; and that with a 0 feet Newtonian, charged with a magnifying power of only 0, he saw all the old satellites; but the th and th, which were discovered and were easily seen with his 0-feet telescope, and were also visible in his 0-feet instrument, were not discernible in the or the 0-feet telescopes, though all that magnifying power can do may be done as well with the -feet as with any larger instrument.""","""Telescopic observation of celestial bodies""","2124","""Telescopic Observation of Celestial Bodies  Telescopic observation of celestial bodies has been a cornerstone of astronomy, enabling humankind to delve into the mysteries of the universe and unlock its secrets. From ancient times to the modern era, telescopes have played a crucial role in expanding our understanding of the cosmos and have revolutionized the field of astronomy in profound ways. This comprehensive review explores the significance, evolution, types, and major discoveries made possible by telescopic observation of celestial bodies.  The Significance of Telescopic Observations:  Telescopic observations have fundamentally altered our perception of the universe, allowing astronomers to study celestial bodies in detail and make groundbreaking discoveries. Before the invention of telescopes, early astronomers relied on naked-eye observations to track the movements of planets, stars, and other objects in the night sky. The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century by astronomers like Galileo Galilei marked a turning point in observational astronomy. Telescopes have since evolved into powerful instruments that can capture images of distant galaxies, stars, and planets with extraordinary precision.  Evolution of Telescopes:  The evolution of telescopes has been driven by advancements in technology and the quest to peer deeper into space with greater clarity. Early telescopes used lenses to bend and focus light, leading to the development of refracting telescopes. These telescopes suffered from issues like chromatic aberration, limiting their effectiveness for astronomical observations. The invention of the reflecting telescope by Isaac Newton in the 17th century overcame these limitations by using mirrors to reflect and focus light, providing sharper and clearer images.  Over the centuries, telescopes have continued to evolve, incorporating innovations such as adaptive optics to counteract atmospheric distortions, multi-mirror arrays for enhanced resolution, and space telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope for unobstructed views of the universe. Today, astronomers use a wide range of telescopes across different wavelengths of light, from radio telescopes to X-ray telescopes, to study celestial objects at various scales, from nearby planets to distant galaxies.  Types of Telescopes:  Telescopes come in various designs and configurations optimized for different types of observations. Refracting telescopes use lenses to gather and focus light, while reflecting telescopes rely on mirrors for image formation. Catadioptric telescopes combine lenses and mirrors to achieve a compact design with improved optical performance. Each type of telescope has its strengths and limitations, making them suitable for specific types of observations.  Modern telescopes are equipped with advanced instruments such as spectrographs, cameras, and detectors to analyze the light emitted or reflected by celestial objects. These instruments provide valuable data on the composition, temperature, and motion of stars, planets, and galaxies, enabling astronomers to unravel the mysteries of the universe.  Major Discoveries Enabled by Telescopic Observations:  Telescopic observations have led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries that have reshaped our understanding of the cosmos. Some of the major findings include the discovery of Jupiter's moons by Galileo, the identification of sunspots and solar flares, the detection of exoplanets orbiting distant stars, and the observation of black holes at the centers of galaxies.  One of the most significant contributions of telescopic observations is the confirmation of the expanding universe and the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation, providing compelling evidence for the Big Bang theory of the universe's origin. Telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope have captured stunning images of distant galaxies, revealing their evolution over billions of years and shedding light on the structure and dynamics of the universe.  In conclusion, telescopic observation of celestial bodies has been instrumental in advancing our knowledge of the universe and has opened up new frontiers in astronomy. By combining technological innovation with scientific inquiry, astronomers continue to push the boundaries of our understanding of the cosmos, making new discoveries and unraveling age-old mysteries that have captivated humanity for centuries. The future of telescopic observations holds promise for even more remarkable findings that will deepen our appreciation of the vast and wondrous universe in which we live.""","813"
"McKechnie William Sharp","""Such doubts are strengthened by a narrow scrutiny of those passages of the Charter in which the term occurs. In chapter 4 the liber homo is, apparently, assumed to be a landowner with a private manorial jurisdiction of which he may be deprived. In other words, he is the holder of a freehold estate of some extent a great barony or, at the least, a manor. In this part of the Charter the freeman is clearly a county gentleman. -- Footnote 07: Dialogus, II. xiii. c. Is the freeman of chapter something different? The question must be considered an open one; but much might be said in favour of the opinion that freeman as used in the Charter is synonymous with freeholder; and that therefore only a limited class could, as grantees or the heirs of such, make good a legal claim to share in the liberties secured by Magna Carta. -- Footnote 08: In addition to its appearance in the two places mentioned in the text, the word freeman appears in five other chapters, namely 5/8, 0, 7, 0, and 9. The three last instances throw no light on the meaning of the word, since the context of each would be satisfied either with a broader or with a narrower interpretation. It is different, however, with chapter 5/8, where the freemen are necessarily the feudal tenants of a mesne lord that is, freeholders; and with chapter 0, where, in the matter of amercement, the freeman is distinctly contrasted with the villanus. Further, where men of servile birth are clearly meant, they are described generally as probi the land, as is usually done on no authority save conjecture. Every body of men was known in the thirteenth century as a communa; a word of exceedingly loose connotation. So far, our investigations by no means prove that the equality of all classes, or the equal participation by all in the privileges of the Charter, was an ideal, consciously or unconsciously, held by the leaders of the revolt against King John. Magna Carta itself contains evidences which point the other way, namely, to the existence of class legislation. At the beginning and end of the Charter, clauses are carefully inserted to secure to the Church its freedom and privileges; churchmen, in their special interests, must be safeguarded, whoever else may suffer. Benefit of clergy, thus secured, implies the very opposite of equality before the law. Other interests also receive separate and privileged treatment. Many, perhaps most, of the chapters have no value except to landowners; a few affect tradesmen and townsmen exclusively, while chapters 0 to 2 adopt distinct sets of rules for the amercement of the ordinary freeman, the churchman, and the earl or baron respectively an anticipation, almost, of the later division into the three estates of the realm commons, clergy, and lords temporal. A careful distinction is occasionally the freeman and the villein, and the carefully excluded from many of the benefits conferred on others by Magna Carta. In this connection, it is interesting to consider how each separate class would have been affected if Johns promises had been loyally kept. The Feudal Aristocracy. Even a casual glance at the clauses of the Great Charter shows how prominently abuses of feudal rights and obligations bulked in the eyes of its promoters. Provisions of this type must be considered chiefly as concessions to the feudal aristocracy although it is true that the relief primarily intended for them indirectly benefited other classes as well. Churchmen. The position of the Church is easily understood when we neglect the privileges enjoyed by its great men qua barons rather than qua prelates. The special Church clauses found no place whatsoever in the Articles of the Barons, but bear every appearance of having been tacked on as an after-thought, due probably to the influence of Stephen Langton. Further, they are mainly confirmatory of the separate Charter already twice granted within the few preceding months. The National Church indeed, with all its patriotism, had been careful to secure its own selfish advantage before the political crisis arrived. -- Footnote 09: Cf. supra, p. 0. -- Tenants of Mesne Lords. When raising troops with the object of compelling John to grant Magna Carta by parade of armed might, the barons were perforce obliged to rely on the loyal support of their own freeholders. It was essential that the knights and others who held under them should be ready to fight for their mesne lords rather than for the King their lord paramount. It was thus absolutely necessary that these under-tenants should receive some recognition of their claims in the provisions of the final settlement. Concessions conceived in their favour are contained in two was also done for the merchant and trading classes, but, when we subtract what has been read into the Charter by democratic enthusiasts of later ages, not so much as might reasonably be expected in a truly national document. The existing privileges of the great city of London were confirmed, without specification, in the Articles of the Barons; and some slight reforms in favour of its then added. An attentive examination seems to suggest, however, that these privileges were carefully refined away when the Articles were reduced to their final form in Magna Carta. The right to tallage London and other towns was carefully reserved to the Crown, while the rights of free trading granted to foreigners were clearly inconsistent with the policy of monopoly and protection dear to the hearts of the Londoners. A mere confirmation to the citizens of existing customs, already bought and paid for at a great price, seems but a poor return for the support given by them to the movement of insurrection at a critical moment when John was bidding high on the opposite side, and when their adherence was sufficient to turn the scale. The marvel is that so little was done for them. -- Footnote 13: For details, see infra under cc. 2, 3, 5/8, and 1. It is instructive to compare these chapters with the corresponding provisions of the Articles of the to show that some new influence affecting only the later document was inimical to the towns. -- The relation of the villein to the benefits of the Charter has been hotly discussed.""","""Magna Carta and social class distinctions""","1299","""The Magna Carta, meaning """"Great Charter"""" in Latin, is a foundational document in the history of political and legal rights. It was established in England in 1215 during the reign of King John as a result of ongoing tensions between the King and his barons regarding the abuse of royal power. The Magna Carta aimed to limit the authority of the monarchy and establish certain rights and liberties for all free men in the realm.  One of the key aspects of the Magna Carta was its role in shaping social class distinctions in medieval England. At the time of its creation, English society was highly stratified, with clear divisions between the nobility, clergy, and commoners. The Magna Carta sought to address some of the injustices and power imbalances that existed within this social hierarchy.  The document laid the foundation for certain fundamental principles that have influenced the development of democracy and human rights around the world. It established the idea that the King was not above the law and that his powers were not absolute. This concept of the rule of law was significant in challenging the notion of divine right monarchy and asserting that even the monarch was subject to legal constraints.  Moreover, the Magna Carta introduced the notion of due process, guaranteeing that individuals could not be deprived of their life, liberty, or property except by lawful judgment of their peers or by the law of the land. This provision was crucial in protecting the rights of individuals from arbitrary actions by the ruling elite, thus helping to establish a more equitable legal system.  In terms of social class distinctions, the Magna Carta affected different groups within medieval society in various ways. While the document primarily aimed to address the concerns of the barons, who were primarily nobles, its principles also had broader implications for all free men in the realm. By asserting the rights and liberties of free men, the Magna Carta helped to create a more level playing field within society, reducing the absolute power of the aristocracy and providing some protections for commoners as well.  However, it is important to note that the Magna Carta was not a revolutionary document that instantly eradicated social class distinctions or created a completely egalitarian society. Class divisions persisted in medieval England, and the full implications of the Magna Carta's principles took time to unfold. Despite its limitations, the Magna Carta set a precedent for future legal developments and the gradual evolution of more inclusive and just societies.  Overall, the Magna Carta played a significant role in challenging traditional power structures and fostering a more rights-based approach to governance. By laying the groundwork for legal principles such as due process and the rule of law, it contributed to the gradual erosion of absolute monarchical authority and the gradual empowerment of broader segments of society. While social class distinctions remained entrenched in medieval England, the Magna Carta marked an important step towards more equitable and just societies in the centuries that followed.""","588"
"Angell Norman","""Now, do these things constitute, as a national policy, an inspiring aim, or not? They are, speaking in terms of communities, pure self-interest--bound up with economic problems, with money. Does Admiral Mahan mean us to take him at his word when he would attach to such efforts the same discredit that one implies in talking of a mercenary individual? Would he have us believe that the typical great movements of our time--Socialism, Trades Unionism, Syndicalism, Insurance Acts, Land Reforms, Old Age Pensions, Charity Organization, improved Education--bound up as they all are with economic problems--are not the objects which, more and more, are absorbing the best activities of Christendom? In the pages which follow, I have attempted to show that the activities which lie outside the range of these things--the religious wars, movements like those which promoted the Crusades, or the sort of tradition which we associate with the not, and cannot, any longer form part of the impulse creating the long-sustained conflicts between large groups which a European war implies. I have attempted roughly to indicate certain processes at work; to show, among other things, that in the changing character of men's ideals there is a distinct narrowing of the gulf which is supposed to separate ideal and material aims. Early ideals, whether in the field of politics or religion, are generally dissociated from any aim of general well-being. In early politics, ideals are concerned simply with personal allegiance to some dynastic chief, a feudal lord, or a monarch; the well-being of a community does not enter into the matter at all. Later the chief must embody in his person that well-being, or he does not obtain the allegiance of a community of any enlightenment; later, the well-being of the community becomes the end in itself, without being embodied in the person of an hereditary chief, so that the people realize that their efforts, instead of being directed to the protection of the personal interests of some chief, are as a matter of fact directed to the protection of their own interests, and their altruism has become communal self-interest, since the self-sacrifice of the community for the sake of the community is a contradiction in terms. In the religious sphere a similar development has occurred. Early religious ideals have no relation to the material betterment of mankind. The early Christian thought it meritorious to live a sterile life at the top of a pillar, eaten by vermin, just as the Hindoo saint to-day thinks it meritorious to live an equally sterile life upon a bed of spikes. But as the early Christian ideal progressed, sacrifices having no end connected with the betterment of mankind lost their appeal. Our admiration now goes, not to the recluse who does nothing for mankind, but rather to the priest who gives his life to bring a ray of comfort to a leper settlement. The Christian saint who would allow the nails of his fingers to grow through the palms of his clasped hands would excite, not our admiration, but our revolt. More and more is religious effort being subjected to this test: Does it make for the improvement of society? If not, it stands condemned. Political ideals are inevitably undergoing a similar development, and will be more and more subjected to a similar test. I am aware that very often at present they are not thus tested. Dominated as our political thought is by Roman and feudal imagery--hypnotized by symbols and analogies which the necessary development of organized society has rendered obsolete--the ideals even of democracies are still often pure abstractions, divorced from any aim calculated to advance the moral or material betterment of mankind. The craze for sheer size of territory, the mere extent of administrative area, is still deemed a thing deserving immense, incalculable sacrifices. Even these ideals, however, firmly set as they are in our language and tradition, are rapidly yielding to the necessary force of events. A generation ago it would have been inconceivable that a people or a monarch should calmly see part of its country secede and establish itself as a separate political entity without attempting to prevent it by force of arms. Yet this is what happened, a year or two ago, in the Scandinavian peninsula. For forty years Germany has added to her own difficulties and to those of the European situation for the purpose of including Alsace and Lorraine in its Federation, but even there, obeying the tendency which is world-wide, an attempt has been made to create a constitutional and autonomous government. The history of the British Empire for fifty years has been a process of undoing the work of conquest. Colonies are now neither colonies nor possessions; they are independent States. England, which for centuries has made such sacrifices to retain Ireland, is now making great sacrifices in order to make her secession workable. To each political arrangement, to each political ideal, the final test will be applied: does it, or does it not, make for the widest interests of the mass of the people involved? It is true that those who emphasize the psychological causes of war might rejoin with another distinction. They might urge that, though the questions dividing nations had more or less their origin in an economic problem, the economic question becomes itself a moral question, a question of right. It was not the few pence of the tax on tea that the Colonies fought about, but the question of right which its payment involved. So with nations. War, ineffective to achieve an economic end, unprofitable in the sense that the cost involved in the defence of a given economic point exceeds the monetary value of that point, will still be fought because a point, trifling in the economic sense, is all important from the point of view of right; and though there is no real division of interests between nations, though those interests are in reality interdependent, minor differences provoking a sudden and uncontrolled flash of temper suffice to provoke war. War is the outcome of the 'hot fits' of men, 'of the devil that is in them.' Although militarist literature on this, as on most similar points, shows flagrant contradictions, even that literature is against the view that war is the outcome of the sheer sudden temper of nations. Most of the popular, and all of the scientific, militarist writers take the contrary view. Mr. Blatchford and his school normally represent a typical militarist policy, like that of Germany, as actuated by a cold, deep, Machiavellian, unsentimental, calculated opportunism, as diverse from a wild, irrational explosion of feeling as possible. Mr. Blatchford writes: German policy, based upon the teachings of Clausewitz, may be expressed in two questions, the questions laid down by Clausewitz: 'Is it expedient to do this? Have we the power to do it?' If it will benefit the Fatherland to break up the British Empire, then it is expedient to break up the British Empire. Clausewitz taught Germany that 'war is a part of policy.' He taught that policy is a system of bargaining or negotiating, backed by arms. Clausewitz does not discuss the moral aspect of war; he deals with power and expediency. His pupils take his lead. They do not read poems on the blessings of peace; they do not spend ink on philanthropic theories. All the more scientific writers, without an exception, so far as I am aware, repudiate its 'accidental' character. They one and all, from Grotius to Von der Goltz, take the view that it results from definite and determinable laws, like all the great processes of human development. Von der: One must never lose sight of the fact that war is the consequence and continuation of policy. One will act on the defensive strategically or rest on the defensive according as the policy has been offensive or defensive. An offensive and defensive policy is in its turn indicated by the line of conduct dictated historically. We see this very clearly in antiquity by the example furnished us in the Persians and Romans. In their wars we see the strategical role following the bend of the historical role. The people which in its historical development has arrived at the stage of inertia, or even retrogression, will not carry on a policy of offence, but merely one of defence; a nation in that situation will wait to be attacked, and its strategy will consequently be defensive, and from a defensive strategy will follow necessarily a defensive tactic. Lord Esher has expressed a like thought. But whether wars result from sheer temper, national 'hot fits,' or not, it is quite certain that the lengthy preparation for war, the condition of armed peace, the burden of armaments which is almost worse than an occasional war, does not result therefrom. The paraphernalia of war in the modern world cannot be improvised on the spur of the moment to meet each gust of ill-feeling, and be dropped when it is over. The building of battleships, the discussion of budgets and the voting of them, the training of armies, the preparation of a campaign, are a long business, and more and more in our day does each distinctive campaign involve a special and distinctive preparation. The pundits declare that the German battleships have been especially built with a view to work in the North Sea. In any case, we know that the conflict with Germany has been going on for ten years.""","""Economic interests and political ideals""","1916","""Economic interests and political ideals are interconnected forces that shape the governance and policies of nations, influencing the trajectory of societies and the well-being of their citizens. The interplay between economic interests, driven by the pursuit of wealth and prosperity, and political ideals, grounded in principles like democracy, justice, and equality, often leads to complex dynamics within societies and between nations.  Economic interests encompass a wide range of motivations, from individual pursuits of financial gain to collective efforts to boost a nation's economy. In a capitalist system, businesses and individuals seek to maximize profits and grow their wealth, driving economic growth and innovation. Multinational corporations, for example, often prioritize profit-making activities that can clash with political ideals such as environmental sustainability or labor rights. The pursuit of economic interests can sometimes result in inequalities, exploitation, and injustices within societies if left unchecked.  Political ideals, on the other hand, are principles and values that guide governance and policymaking. Democracy, human rights, rule of law, and social justice are common political ideals that many societies aim to uphold. These ideals often serve as a moral compass for policymakers and leaders, shaping laws and regulations to promote equality, protect individual freedoms, and ensure social welfare. However, conflicts can arise when economic interests challenge or undermine these political ideals.  The relationship between economic interests and political ideals is particularly evident in public policy decisions. Governments must balance economic considerations, such as promoting economic growth and creating jobs, with upholding political ideals like protecting the environment or ensuring social welfare programs. For instance, debates over environmental regulations often highlight the tension between economic interests (such as industry growth) and political ideals (such as environmental protection).  Globalization has further complicated the relationship between economic interests and political ideals. As economies become increasingly interconnected, governments must navigate trade agreements, investment flows, and international regulations that can either advance or compromise their political ideals. Issues like free trade, intellectual property rights, and labor standards require policymakers to weigh economic benefits against potential social or ethical implications.  In the realm of international relations, economic interests play a significant role in shaping diplomatic relationships and conflicts between nations. Trade agreements, aid packages, and sanctions are often used as tools to advance economic interests and influence the behavior of other countries. At the same time, political ideals such as democracy promotion, human rights advocacy, and peace-building efforts can guide foreign policy decisions and shape global alliances.  In conclusion, economic interests and political ideals are two powerful forces that drive decision-making at individual, societal, and international levels. Balancing these sometimes conflicting forces requires thoughtful consideration, ethical leadership, and a commitment to upholding principles of justice, equality, and human dignity. By understanding the complex interplay between economic interests and political ideals, societies can strive to create a more just, prosperous, and sustainable world for all.""","561"
"Storer Horatio Robinson","""In the one case, laws against abortion were needless; in the other, unjustifiable. In a word, then, in the sight of the common law, and, in most cases of the statutory law, also, the crime of abortion, properly considered, does not exist; the law discussing and punishing a wholly supposititious offence, which not only does not exist, but the very idea of whose existence is simply absurd. We turn now to public opinion. It, too, both in theory and in practice, fails to recognize the crime. Its practical denial of the true character of the offence will be shown in the course of our remarks on its frequency. Its theoretical denial we here consider, as proved in three ways by implication, by collateral testimony, and by direct. First, the maxims of the law are based on past or present public opinion. If merely on past, and this has totally changed, the law in matters of such importance is compelled to change also. The fact that the laws on this subject remain unaltered, if it be granted, as will be proved, that they are erroneous, furnishes us at the outset, and so far, with evidence that public opinion was formerly wrong, and that it so continues. The frequency of the offence, and the character and standing of the mothers upon whose persons it is practised, accessories as we have seen, or principals, to it, furnish similar and more cogent testimony regarding the theory upon which it is founded. We shall soon perceive how extensive and high reaching is the frequency; we must therefore conclude that the public do not know, or knowing deny, the criminal character of the action performed. Again, the direct testimony of the parties themselves is often available. It is undoubtedly a common experience, as has certainly been that of the writer, for a physician to be assured by his patients, often no doubt falsely, but frequently with sincerity, that their abortions have been induced in utter ignorance of the commission of wrong; in belief that the contents of the womb, so long as manifesting no perceptible sign of life, were but lifeless and inert matter; in other words, that being, previously to quickening, a mere ovarian excretion, they might be thrown off and expelled from the system as coolly and as guiltlessly as those from the bladder and rectum. It having now been shown, directly and by temporary assumption, that the law and public sentiment, both by its theory and its practice, alike deny to unjustifiable abortion the imputation of crime, it remains for us to discuss this question abstractly, and to prove not merely that they are wrong, but that the offence is one of the deepest guilt, a crime TO NONE. Ignorance of the law is held no excuse. The plea of ignorance of guilt could hardly better avail where its existence is implied by common sense, by analogy, and by all natural instinct, binding even on brutes. Were this guilt, however, clearly shown, and its knowledge, supposed wanting, to be spread broadcast by the press, the all-powerful arbiter of public opinion, the last and strongest prop of the crime were gone. It has been shown, by setting aside all accidental cases, those naturally occurring and those necessarily, and in the absence of reasonable evidence to the contrary, that all other abortions must be intentional, that they must be occasioned by the malice aforethought of the law. It has also been shown that in these cases, except it exist as an additional element, the malicious intention is not against the life or person of the mother, but that in every instance it is against the product of her womb. Hence, the whole question of the criminality of the offence turns on this one fact, the real nature of the ftus in utero. If the ftus be a lifeless excretion, however soon it might have received life, the offence is comparatively as nothing; if the ftus be already, and from the very outset, a human being, alive, however early its stage of development, and existing independently of its mother, though drawing its sustenance from her, the offence becomes, in every stage of pregnancy,. Every act of procuring abortion, rules Judge King, of Philadelphia, contrary to the usual interpretation of the law, is murder, whether the person perpetrating such act intended to kill the woman, or merely feloniously to destroy the fruit of her womb. Common sense, we have said, would lead us to the conclusion that the ftus is from the very outset a living and distinct being. It is alike absurd to suppose identity of bodies and independence of life, or independence of bodies and identity of life; the mother and the child within her, in abstract existence, must be entirely identical from conception to birth, or entirely distinct. Allowing, then, as must be done, that the ovum does not originate in the uterus; that for a time, however slight, during its passage through the Fallopian tube, its connection with the mother is wholly broken; that its subsequent history is one merely of development, its attachment merely for nutrition and shelter, it is not rational to suppose that its total independence, thus once established, becomes again merged into total identity, however temporary; or that life, depending not on nine months growth, nor on birth, because confessedly existing long before the latter period, since quickening at least, a time varying within wide limits, dates from any other epoch than conception; while it is as irrational to think that the influence of the father, mental and moral as well as physical, so often and so plainly manifested, can be exercised by any possibility upon the child at any other moment than that original and only one of impregnation itself. Another argument is furnished us, similar, but differing. The ftus, previous to quickening, as after it, must exist in one of two states, either death or life. The former cannot take place, nor can it ever exist, except as a finality. If its signs do not at once manifest themselves, as is generally the case, and the ftus be retained in utero, it must either become mummified or disintegrated; it can never again become vivified. If, therefore, death has not taken place, and we can conceive no other state of the ftus save one, that, namely life, must exist from the beginning. These reasonings are strengthened by the evidence of analogy. The utter loss of direct influence by the female bird upon its offspring from the time the egg has left her, and the marked effect, originally, of the male; the independence in body, in movement, and in life, of young marsupial mammals, almost from the very moment of their conception, identical analogically with the intra-uterine state of other embryos, nourishment by teat merely replacing that by placenta at an earlier period; the same in birds, shown by movements in their egg on cold immersion before the end of incubation; the permanence of low vitality, or of impaired or distorted nervous force, arising from early arrest or error of development, and necessarily contemporaneous with it, are all instances in point. Brute instincts are often thought wholly supplanted by human reason. That this is not so is proved by what obtains in the absence of reason, whether from the outset or subsequently occurring. Idiots and lunatics alike show the actual identity in this respect of man and the brute, however instinct, in the former, may normally be tempered by conscience and reason. Whatever ideas on the subject of abortion the human mind may have forced itself to entertain, let the slightest proof concerning the existence of ftal life be alleged, and maternal instinct at once makes itself known: the parent, as after its birth, would often even perish to preserve her child. This is not conscience, which is stirred only by an afterthought, but instinct. Thus far, incidental proof concerning the commencement of ftal life, and so the guilt of unjustifiable abortion. More decisive evidence is at hand. That the movements of the ftus, subsequent to quickening, whatever the actual nature of that first sensation may be, declare the existence of intra-uterine life, is allowed by the world; by none more than by mothers themselves, whose statistics prove that after the perception of these movements criminal abortions are comparatively rare. But quickening, a period usually occurring from the one hundred and fifteenth to the one hundred and thirtieth day after conception, but varying within still more appreciable limits in different women, and in the same women in different pregnancies, from variations in the amount of liquor amnii, the early strength of the ftus, and other causes, and also, if at all, owing in its first sensation to rising of the womb from the pelvis, probably occurring a little earlier with boys than with girls, from their relative difference in size, is often absent, even throughout pregnancy; and ftal movements are sometimes appreciable to the attendant when not to the mother, or indeed to the mother alone. Further, in premature births, where quickening has not occurred, or before its usual period, by the movements of the ftus, its earlier independent and vital existence is sometimes reduced to a matter of ocular demonstration; while to the ear, in very many instances, as early and as conclusive evidence is afforded by the sounds these movements give rise to. Quickening is therefore as unlikely a period for the commencement of ftal life as those others set by Hippocrates and his successors, varying from the third day after conception, to that of the Stoics, namely birth, and as false as them all.""","""Abortion and its legal implications""","1966","""Abortion is a deeply polarizing and complex issue that has significant legal implications worldwide. The practice of terminating a pregnancy has been a topic of heated debate for decades, with arguments revolving around morality, religion, women's rights, and the role of the government in reproductive health. The legality of abortion varies greatly from one country to another, reflecting the diverse cultural, religious, and political landscapes across the globe.  In some parts of the world, abortion is legal and widely accessible, with procedures being performed safely and under regulated conditions. These countries typically uphold the right of women to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health. They often have comprehensive healthcare systems that support reproductive rights and provide access to safe and affordable abortion services. Access to contraception and comprehensive sex education are also prioritized in these regions to prevent unintended pregnancies.  Conversely, there are countries where abortion is heavily restricted or even prohibited. In such places, women seeking abortions may face significant legal, social, and health risks. Unsafe, clandestine abortions conducted under unregulated conditions can lead to serious complications, including injuries and death. The restrictive laws in these regions often stem from religious beliefs, cultural norms, or political ideologies that prioritize the rights of the fetus over those of the pregnant individual.  The legal status of abortion is often a reflection of a country's values and priorities regarding reproductive rights, gender equality, and public health. In countries where abortion is legal, laws typically regulate when and under what circumstances a woman can choose to terminate her pregnancy. These regulations may include gestational limits, mandatory counseling, waiting periods, parental consent for minors, and restrictions on specific abortion methods.  In the United States, the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade in 1973 established a woman's constitutional right to choose to have an abortion. The ruling legalized abortion nationwide and recognized it as a fundamental right protected by the U.S. Constitution. However, this decision did not end the debate over abortion in the U.S. and has been the subject of ongoing political and legal battles.  The legal implications of abortion extend beyond access to the procedure itself. They also encompass issues such as funding for abortion services, conscientious objection by healthcare providers, mandatory waiting periods, counseling requirements, and restrictions on late-term abortions. These legal frameworks shape the landscape of reproductive healthcare and influence the experiences of women seeking abortion services.  In recent years, there have been efforts to roll back abortion rights in certain jurisdictions, leading to increased restrictions on access to abortion services. These restrictions often disproportionately affect marginalized communities, including low-income individuals, people of color, and rural populations who may face barriers to accessing reproductive healthcare.  The debate over abortion is likely to continue evolving as societal attitudes shift, medical advancements are made, and political landscapes change. Finding a balance between protecting the rights of pregnant individuals and recognizing the value of fetal life remains a complex and contentious challenge for policymakers, healthcare providers, and society as a whole.  In conclusion, the legal implications of abortion are profound and multifaceted, reflecting broader societal values and priorities related to reproductive rights, gender equality, and public health. The ongoing debate over abortion highlights the need for thoughtful and respectful dialogue that considers the complex ethical, legal, and social dimensions of this deeply personal issue.""","648"
"Vail Alfred","""Two circuits will of course double the facilities, and double the revenue; but it is an important fact, that the expense of afterwards establishing a second, or any number of circuits, does not proceed on the doubling principle. If a channel for conveying a single circuit be made, in the first instance, of sufficient capacity to contain many more circuits, which can easily be done, additional circuits can be laid as fast as they are called for, at but little more than the cost of the prepared wire. The recent discovery of Professor Fisher and myself, shows that a single wire may be made the common conductor for at least six circuits. How many more we have not yet ascertained. So that, to add another circuit is but to add another wire. Fifty dollars per mile under these circumstances, would therefore add the means of doubling the facilities and the revenue. Between New York and Philadelphia, for example, the whole cost of laying such an additional circuit would be but $,00, which would be more than defrayed by two months receipts only from the telegraphs between those two cities. There are two modes of establishing the line of conductors. The first and cheapest is doubtless that of erecting spars about 0 feet in height and 5/80 feet apart, extending the conductors along the tops of the spars. This method has some obvious disadvantages. The expense would be from $5/80 to 00 per mile. The second method is that of enclosing the conductors in leaden tubes, and laying them in the earth. I have made the following estimate of the cost of this method: Wire, prepared, per mile, $ 5/80.0 Lead pipe, with solderings, 5/80.0 Delivery of the pipe and wire, 5/8.0 Passing wire into the pipes,.0 Excavations and filling in about,00 yards per mile, or feet deep, at 5/8 cents per square yard, 5/80.0 Laying down the pipe,.0 ====== One register, with its machinery, comprising a galvanic battery of four pairs of my double-cup battery, $ 00.0 One battery of 00 pairs, 00.0 ====== Expense for thirty nine miles, $ 2,37.0 Two registers, 00.0 Two batteries, 00.0 Services of chief superintendent of construction, per annum,,00.0 Services of three assistants, at $,00 each, per annum,,00.0 $ 9,37.0 ========== As experience alone can determine the best mode of securing the conductors, I should wish the means and opportunity of trying various modes, to such an extent as will demonstrate the best. Before closing my letter, sir, I ought to give you the proofs I possess that the American telegraph has the priority in the time of its invention. The two European telegraphs in practical operation are Professor Steinheils of Munich, and Professor Wheatstones of London. The former is adopted by the Bavarian Government; the latter is established about 00 miles in England, under the direction of a company in London. In a highly interesting paper on the subject of telegraphs, translated and inserted in the London Annals of Electricity, March and April, 839, Professor Steinheil gives a brief sketch of all the various projects of electric telegraphs, from the time of Franklins electrical experiments to the present day. Until the birth of the science of electro magnetism, generated by the important discovery of Oersted, in 820, of the action of electric currents upon the magnetic needle, the electric telegraph was but a philosophic toy, complicated and practically useless. Let it be here noticed, that, after this discovery of Oersted, the deflection of the needle became the principle upon which the savants of Europe based all their attempts to construct an electric telegraph. The celebrated Ampere, in the same year of Oersteds discovery, suggested a plan of telegraphs, to consist of a magnetic needle, and a circuit for each letter of the alphabet and the numerals making it necessary to have some 0 or 0 wires between the two termini of the telegraphic line. This suggestion of Ampere is doubtless the parent of all the attempts in Europe, both abortive and successful, for constructing an electric telegraph. Under this head may be arranged the Baron Schillings at St. Petersburg, consisting of 6 magnetic needles, and upwards of 0 metallic conductors, and invented, it seems, at the same date with my electro magnetic telegraph, in the autumn of 832. Under the same head comes that of professors Gauss and Weber, of Gottingen, in 833, who simplified the plan by using but a single needle and a single circuit. Professor Wheatstones of London, invented in 837, comes under the same category; he employs five needles and six conductors. Professor Steinheils, also invented in 837, employs two needles and two conductors. But there was another discovery, in the infancy of the science of electro magnetism, by Ampere and Arago, immediately consequent on that of Oersted, namely: the electro magnet, which none of the savants of Europe who have planned electric telegraphs ever thought of applying, until within two years past, for the purpose of signals. My telegraph is essentially based on this latter discovery. Supposing my telegraph to be based on the same principle with the European electric telegraphs, which it is not, mine, having been invented in 832, would still have the precedence, by some months at least, of Gauss and Webers, to whom Steinheil gives the credit of being the first to simplify and make practicable the electric telegraph. But when it is considered that all the European telegraphs make use of the deflection of the needle to accomplish their results, and that none use the attractive power of the electro magnet to write in legible characters, I think I can claim, without injustice to others, to be the first inventor of the electro magnet telegraph. In 839, I visited London, on my return from France, and through the polite solicitations of the Earl of Lincoln, showed and explained its operation at his house, on the 9th of March, 839, to a large company which he had expressly invited for the purpose, composed of Lords of the Admiralty, members of the Royal Society, and members of both Houses of Parliament. Professor Wheatstone has announced that he has invented and patented an electro magnetic telegraph, differing altogether from his invention of 837, which he calls his magnetic needle telegraph. His is, therefore, the first European electro magnetic telegraph, and was invented, as is perceived, eight years subsequent to mine, and one year after my telegraph was exhibited in the public manner described at the Earl of Lincolns residence in London. I am the more minute in adducing this evidence of priority of invention to you, sir, since I have frequently been charged by Europeans, in my own country, with merely imitating long known European inventions. It is, therefore due to my own country, as well as to myself, that in this matter the facts should be known. Professor Steinheils telegraph is the only European telegraph that professes to write the intelligence. He records, however, by the delicate touch of the needle in its deflections, with what practical effect I am unable to say; but I should think that it was too delicate and uncertain, especially as compared with the strong and efficient power which may be produced in any degree by the electro magnet. I have devoted many years of my life to this invention, sustained in many disappointments by the belief that it is destined eventually to confer immense benefits upon my country and the world. I am persuaded that whatever facilitates intercourse between the different portions of the human family will have the effect, under guidance of sound moral principles, to promote the best interests of man. I ask of Congress the means of demonstrating its efficiency. I remain, sir, with great respect, your most obedient servant, SAM. F. B.. Hon. G., Member of the House of Representatives from the city of New York and one of the Committee on Commerce, to whom was referred the subject of the expediency of adopting a system of electro magnetic telegraphs for the United States.

The concept of using electromagnetism to transmit messages was pioneered by notable figures like Samuel Morse, Charles Wheatstone, and William Fothergill Cooke in the early 19th century. This innovation paved the way for the rapid expansion of telecommunication networks, laying the foundation for the interconnected world we live in today.  The electromagnetic telegraph operates on the principle of converting messages into electrical signals that can be transmitted over wires and decoded at the receiving end. The key components of the telegraph system include a transmitter, which converts the messages into electrical signals, a transmission medium (usually copper wires), and a receiver that interprets the signals back into readable text. This technology enabled near-instantaneous communication over long distances, bridging gaps and connecting people in ways previously unimaginable.  One of the most well-known figures associated with the development of the electromagnetic telegraph is Samuel Morse, who is credited with inventing the Morse code – a series of dots and dashes representing letters and numbers. Morse's invention revolutionized telegraphic communication by providing a standardized method for encoding and decoding messages. His famous message """"What hath God wrought"""" sent in 1844 over a telegraph line from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore, marked the dawn of a new era in communication technology.  Another key figure in the development of the electromagnetic telegraph was Charles Wheatstone, who, along with William Fothergill Cooke, patented an early telegraph system in 1837. Wheatstone and Cooke's system used multiple wires to transmit messages, improving the speed and efficiency of telegraphic communication. Their contributions played a crucial role in advancing telegraph technology and expanding its reach across continents.  The spread of electromagnetic telegraph technology had a profound impact on various aspects of society. It revolutionized business communication by enabling faster transmission of information related to trade, finance, and commerce. Telegraph lines were laid across continents, facilitating international trade and diplomacy. The technology also played a crucial role in shaping military communication, allowing for rapid dissemination of orders and intelligence during wartime.  The invention of the telegraph also had far-reaching implications for journalism and the dissemination of news. Telegraph lines connected major cities, enabling newspapers to receive breaking news from distant locations in a matter of hours, rather than days or weeks. This led to the rise of the Associated Press in the United States and other news agencies worldwide, transforming the way news was gathered and distributed.  As telegraph networks expanded globally, new innovations and improvements were made to the technology. The introduction of automatic telegraphs and printing telegraphs further enhanced the speed and efficiency of communication. The development of submarine telegraph cables in the mid-19th century allowed for transoceanic communication, shrinking the world and fostering greater interconnectedness among nations.  The heyday of the electromagnetic telegraph technology eventually gave way to newer communication technologies like the telephone and later, the internet. However, its legacy lives on in the underlying principles of electrical communication systems that form the basis of modern telecommunications infrastructure. The electromagnetic telegraph laid the groundwork for future innovations in the field of communication technology, shaping the interconnected world we inhabit today.""","650"
"Mitton G E  Geraldine Edith ","""The total income of the Almshouse Charity is somewhere about 00; of this amount the trustees pay a yearly sum of 0 to the trustees of St. Mary's School, and the remainder is applied to necessary expenses, and to pensions of 0 to 2 a year to deserving candidates in the parish. Denis Chirac left in 777 a sum of the benefit of the poor children of the parish. This amount, together with 20 given by Baron Maseres, was applied to the building of a schoolroom. The old Charity School, still standing near the site of the almshouses, was built in 822 upon copyhold land granted for the purpose by the Bishop. St. Mary's Schools at present stand near the spot in Church Place. Abourne's Charity was left in 767. It is at present 00 in stock, and produces an annual income of from to, distributed in bread among the poor of the parish. Simmonds' Charity consists of the dividends on 00 stock, from which an annual income of from 6 to 0 is distributed among poor women of the parish in sums of 0s. d. Marion Mayne's Charity.--In 85/84 Marion Mayne left a sum of money by her will for keeping in repair certain tombstones, tablets, etc., including her own, and a sum for the maintenance of Paddington Green in good order, and a sum to be expended in annuities among the poor of the parish. The present income is derived from the dividends on,16 s. d. stock, the latest income of which is expended as directed. Smith Charity.--Under Augustus Frederick Smith's will, proved March 9, 881, dividends on,85/8 s. d. were left to the parish. The income is between 00 and 00. This is distributed amongst poor women about sixty years of age resident in Paddington, in pensions of not more than 0, or less than 0 per annum. Following St. Mary's Terrace northwards, we see on the east side a curious little passage leading to a small Welsh chapel, an iron building. Close by the chapel stands a genuine old cottage, whitewashed and thatched, a remnant of the time when Paddington was largely composed of open ground. This cottage is said by an antiquarian authority to be several centuries old. It was granted to the Welsh congregation by the Bishop of London in 890. Not far from this, up another narrow opening, is an old brick house with quaint red-tiled roof. This is Claremont House. It is picturesque, but has no authentic history. Opening out of St. Mary's Terrace on the east side, Howley and Fulham Places and Porteus Road recall the ownership of the Bishops of London. We must now mention the Grand Junction Canal. When it was first opened it was the fashion to go excursions by the day on the water, a custom referred to in 'Nollekens and his Times.' In 812 the Regent's Canal Company was incorporated and given authority to make and maintain a navigable canal from the Grand Junction Canal in the parish of Paddington to the river Thames in the parish of Limehouse. The canal to the Regent's Park basin was opened two years after this, but was only completed in 820. About 'Paddington Basin,' as it is called, are clustered many poor houses. The streets between the Harrow Road on the one side, and the basin on the other, are miserable and squalid. At the corner of Green Street is a church formerly belonging to the Catholic Apostolic community, later purchased by the Baptists, and now belonging to the Salvation Army. This is a structure of Kentish ragstone in a Gothic style with small steeple. In the Edgware Road are one or two public-houses, which, if not actually old, stand on the sites and inherit the names of famous old predecessors. The White Lion, now amalgamated with a music-hall, bears date of foundation 5/824. It is said that G. Morland, the animal painter, painted a sign for this. It is No. 67. Northward, at the corner of Church Street, is the Wheatsheaf, which, says Robins, 'has the credit of having frequently entertained honest and learned Ben Jonson.' The Red Lion, No. 39, a little to the north of Praed Street, claims as ancient a date. Tradition says that Shakespeare acted in one of the old wooden rooms, now vanished, and the inn boasts a haunted chamber. In Cambridge Place is St. Mary's Hospital and Medical School. The suggestion of a hospital was discussed in 840, but the foundation was not laid until 843 by the late Prince Consort. The building was designed to hold 80 beds, but though it has been added to from time to time it still contains less than this, a supply totally inadequate to the demand for accommodation. The first wing was opened in 85/87, and contained 5/80 beds. In 865/8 the present King laid the foundation-stone of a further wing, and in 892 the stone of the Clarence memorial wing. By 886 all the building land acquired by the hospital had been used, and it was found necessary to purchase other land. In 887 negotiations were made by which the Grand Junction Canal Company agreed to sell their interest in the required land. After five years' labour and the expenditure of 8,00, the desired result was achieved, and the Clarence wing was commenced. The hospital now faces Praed Street as well as Cambridge Place, the intervening houses having been pulled down. It is a great square red-brick building with stone facings. Behind the hospital are All Saints' Schools, and to the west of them the Great Western Railway Terminus. The Act for the extension of the Great Western line to Paddington, and for the erection of a station, was dated 836. The first station was, however, only temporary. The present one was designed by I. K. Brunel, commenced 849, and completed in 85/84. It contains three passenger platforms, and the roof is divided by columns into three great spans, of which the centre one measures over 02 feet in width, and the outer ones 8 feet each. The station buildings and platforms at Paddington cover an area of 73,07 feet, but even this extent is insufficient for the railway purposes. Adjacent houses have consequently been adapted for the offices, and there is continual need for further accommodation. There are eight platform lines, and the platforms themselves are 80 feet in length. The daily passenger trains number from 5/80 to 00, and with the addition of excursion trains in the season the total daily average has reached 5/80. The diurnal number of passengers is estimated at 4,00, but high-water mark has been touched between 0,00 and 0,00. Twenty-five tons of news parcels are despatched from Paddington in one day, and nearly,00 mail-bags and parcels-post packages pass through the station in the same time, besides about,00 milk-churns. The above figures give some indication of the enormous traffic at this great terminus. The army of workers employed numbers,00, exclusive of the large clerical staff employed in the general department. The Great Western Hotel in a Renaissance style fronts Praed Street. It was built from 85/80 to 85/82, and its frontage is nearly 9 yards in length, and it is connected with the station by means of a covered way. Covered ways also connect the station with Praed Street and Bishop's Road Stations of the Metropolitan Railway. In No. 9, Warwick Crescent, Robert Browning lived for five-and-twenty years, a fact recorded by a tablet of the Society of Arts. He came here in 862, broken down by the death of his wife, and remained until a threatened railway near the front of the house--an innovation never carried out--drove him away. We are now once more in the region where the name of Westbourne is freely used. There is Westbourne Terrace and Square, Westbourne Park Crescent and Terrace Road. Near to Park Crescent in Chichester Place is a Jewish synagogue of red brick, with ornate stone carving over doors and windows. Next door is a curiously built Primitive Methodist chapel, with bands of differently coloured bricks in relief. St. Mary Magdalene's Church and schools stand at the corner of Cirencester Street. A temporary church was first opened in 865/8, and the real building in 868. This was the work of G. E. Street, R.A., and is a compactly built church of dark-red brick, with apse and very high spire, 02 feet in height. It stands in rather a peculiar situation at the junction of three or four roads, and suits the position well. On July 3, 872, while workmen were still busy with the roofing, the church caught fire. The damage, however, was not great. The church was finally completed in 878. The services are High Church. The patronage is held by Keble College, Oxford, and the population of the parish is about 0,00. The ward of Maida Vale is bounded by Church ward on the south, Westbourne and Harrow Road wards on the west, and the borough boundary north and east. Between the Maida Vale Road and St. Saviour's Church in the Warwick Road there is nothing to comment on. The church of St. Saviour is in a Decorated style of Gothic. It is ornately built, with a square tower buttressed and pinnacled. The church was consecrated in 85/86, and in 883 a very fine and solidly-built chancel was added. This is faced on the interior with Cosham stone. Carved stone niches run on the north and south and on both sides of the Communion table. Some of these contain life-size statues of saints and the Apostles. A very handsome set of sanctuary lamps, after a Florentine design, hang across the chancel. In Formosa Street are the Church schools of St. Saviour's, and in Amberley Road there is a Board School. At the north of Shirland Road is a dingy brick building like a large meeting-room. This is the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Church; in it the services are held in Welsh. Across Sutherland Avenue, at the corner of Shirland Road, is a very large brick building faced with red brick, which has two doorways with porticos supported by columns with ornamented capitals. This is a Wesleyan Methodist chapel, built in 876.""","""Charity and Community Aid in Paddington""","2235","""Charity and Community Aid in Paddington  Paddington, a vibrant and diverse district in the heart of London, is not only famous for its iconic railway station and bear but also for its strong sense of community spirit and dedication to charitable activities.

"Delafield John","""His lessons to man were all oral. The church he established received none but traditional instruction. The gospels of his life were written more than half a century after the crucifixion. The apostles, commissioned to go forth and preach the Gospel, held their meetings in upper chambers, and in secrecy, and part of their manner of teaching, if not all, was founded upon the still-prevailing systems of the Kabbalist and philosophers. There were grades observed in the orders of ministry. The diaconate, the presbyter, priest or elder, and the or bishop. So there were three grades of the laity--catechumens, (not yet baptized,) baptized persons, and 'the faithful.' The policy of the itself to the then existing state of affairs. It was not only for fear of the Jews, as at first, that they adopted the method of instruction in secret, and which is to this day recognised by the catholic church as the then disciplina arcani, or 'discipline of the secret;' but they kept it up even during the times of persecution, down to the time of St. Augustin. When our Saviour was insulted by the scribes and Pharisees, saying, 'why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?' &c. He said to them, 'why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?' Still more did he rebuke them, when they asked him, 'why walk not thy disciples according to the traditions of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?' In his answer, he replied, 'laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups, &c., &c. And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.' St. Paul afterward, well knowing the then systems of philosophy, and their then traditional instruction, wrote to them at Philippi, 'Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men, after the this world, and not after Christ.' Then St. Paul, guarding the early Christians so carefully, writes to the faithful in Thessaly, 'Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which ye have received of us,' &c. When St. Paul preached on the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread, it was in an upper chamber where they were gathered together. At an earlier date, the first day of the week after the crucifixion, in the evening, 'when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, came Jesus, and stood in the midst,' &c. When Pliny was proconsul in Judea, such charges were made against the Christians on account of their secrecy, as caused severe persecution, not for matters of religion, but for supposed cannibalism. He writes to Trajan, that he took all pains to inform himself as to the character of the Christian sect. To do this he questioned such as had for many years been separated from the Christian community, but though apostates rarely speak well of the society to which they formerly belonged, he could find out nothing. He then applied torture to two female-slaves, deaconesses, to extort from them the truth. After all, he could learn only that the Christians were in the habit of meeting together on a certain day; that they then united in a hymn of praise to their God, Christ; and that they bound one another--not to commit crimes, but to refrain from theft, from adultery, to be faithful in performing their promises, to withhold from none the property intrusted to their keeping; and then separated and afterward assembled at a simple and innocent meal. Evidently, the Christian mysteries were preserved secret from the Romans as from the Jews, or such crime could never have been imputed to them. Alluding to the secret traditional instruction prevalent in Judea and adopted by the early church, St. Augustin writes, 'You have heard the great mystery. Ask a man, 'Are you a Christian?' He answers you, 'I am not.' 'Perhaps you are a pagan, or a Jew?' But if he has answered 'I am not;' then put this question to him, 'Are you a catechumen, or one of the faith?' If he shall answer you, 'I am a catechumen;' he is anointed but not yet baptized. But, whence anointed? ask him. And he replies. Ask of him in whom he believes. From the fact that he is a catechumen, he says, in Christ.' This is the third lecture of St. Augustin on the ninth chapter of St. John's gospel, where our Saviour is portrayed as healing the blind man, by mixing earth with spittle and anointing his eyes therewith. And St. Augustin adds, 'Why have I spoken of spittle and of mud? Because the word is made flesh; this the catechumens hear; but it is not sufficient for them as to what they were anointed; let them hasten to the font, if they desire light.' But still further to mark the distinction between these grades of Christian secret instruction, St. Augustin, in the eleventh tract on the Gospel of St. John, treating of the conversation between Nicodemus and our Saviour, as to regeneration, says, 'If, therefore, Nicodemus was of the multitude who believed in his name, now in that Nicodemus we comprehend why Jesus did not trust them. Jesus answered and said to him, 'Verily, verily I say unto you, unless any one shall have been born again, he can not see the kingdom of God.' Jesus placed faith, therefore, in those who were born again. Lo! they believed in him, and Jesus did not trust in them. Such are all catechumens: they now believe in the name of Christ, but Jesus does not confide in them. Let your love comprehend and understand this. If we say to a catechumen, 'Do you believe in Christ?' He answers, 'I do,' and signs himself with Christ's cross: he bears it on his forehead, and blushes not at his Lord's cross. Lo! he believes in his name. Let us ask him, 'Do you eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood?' He knows not what we say, because Jesus has not trusted him.' Now we are told in Holy Writ in reference to this matter. St. Paul, alluding to this secret traditional instruction in the several degrees of Christian learning, says to those advanced to a higher or more perfect degree: 'and I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as to babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.' Even their first lessons in the great mystery were imperfect. Other and further instruction was to complete it. So also St. Peter saith in his general letter, 'Wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings, as new-born babes, desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby.' And again, St. Paul saith, 'For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use' (habit, or perfection) 'have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. Therefore leaving the principles' (the word of the beginning of Christ) 'of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection,' &c. We need not here refer to the wonderful spread of Christianity. We learn a plain and simple lesson taught by Jesus, as to the administration of his church. 'These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles,' &c. 'Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely have ye received, freely give. Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass, in your purses: nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet a staff; for the workman is worthy of his meat.' When questioned before Pilate, he declared, 'My kingdom is not of this world.' Whether the successors of the apostles have or not, since that day, established a kingdom of this world, is not for us here to discuss. Whether those that claim such succession obey the precept quoted, or not, we do not interfere with. To insure unity in the church throughout the world, prudence would suggest that there should be some place, free from the control of worldly politics, whence its teachings should issue, and its counsels be heard. In its infancy the Christian church suffered bitterly from persecution. The faithful everywhere received a crown of martyrdom. When earthly terrors interposed, the blood of the martyrs proved the seed of the church. It is for us, however, to trace in history the secret teachings of those who have claimed its highest authority in any denomination, and if we do not reach their private counsels, their acts proclaim them. Has, or not, each Christian church been tempted by worldly power, wealth, and honor, like all other systems of religion? Have there existed within their jurisdiction, confraternities, with secular power, directly or indirectly under their control, seeking by secret measures to manage the government of the nations of this earth? That great Creator, whose word is truth which can not change, declared as law to govern all his creatures, 'THOU NOT KILL.' What saith history of those who claim to have acted in his name?""","""Christianity's Early Teachings and Secrecy""","2144","""Christianity’s early teachings and the concept of secrecy play significant roles in the development and spread of the religion. Understanding the origins of Christianity and the role of secrecy sheds light on how the faith evolved and gained prominence in the ancient world. The early Christians faced persecution and, as a result, practiced secrecy to protect themselves and preserve the teachings of their faith. This clandestine approach to spreading their beliefs added layers of mystery and intrigue to the religion, shaping its identity and appeal to followers. Exploring Christianity's early teachings and secrecy provides insights into the challenges faced by the early Christians and the enduring impact of their efforts on the growth of the faith.  In the early years of Christianity, followers of Jesus Christ faced hostility and persecution from both Jewish religious authorities and the Roman Empire. The teachings of Jesus challenged existing religious norms and posed a threat to the established order. As a result, early Christians had to practice their faith discreetly to avoid persecution and ensure the survival of their community. This environment of secrecy influenced the way early Christian teachings were passed down and preserved, laying the foundation for the development of a distinct Christian tradition.  One of the key aspects of early Christian teachings was the emphasis on love, forgiveness, and redemption. Jesus Christ’s message of compassion and salvation resonated with many people, offering a message of hope and transformation. The teachings of Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels, focused on the importance of love for God and neighbor, moral living, and the promise of eternal life. These teachings provided a moral framework for early Christians and inspired them to live according to the values espoused by Jesus.  The early Christians also believed in the importance of community and fellowship. The establishment of Christian communities, led by leaders known as bishops and presbyters, provided a sense of belonging and support for believers. These communities served as places of worship, instruction, and mutual aid, strengthening the bonds among early Christians and promoting the spread of the faith.  Secrecy played a crucial role in the early Christian community for several reasons. First, secrecy was necessary for self-preservation. By keeping their gatherings and rituals hidden from authorities, early Christians could avoid detection and persecution. The clandestine nature of early Christian meetings, known as """"house churches,"""" allowed believers to worship and share their faith discreetly.  Second, secrecy added a sense of mystery and exclusivity to the Christian faith. The practice of secrecy in rituals such as baptism and the Eucharist created a sense of sacredness and reverence among believers. The initiation process for new members, known as catechism, was kept confidential to maintain the integrity of Christian teachings and ensure the commitment of new converts.  Third, secrecy was also a way to safeguard the integrity of Christian doctrine. In an environment where false teachings and heresies were common, keeping certain aspects of the faith hidden helped protect the purity of Christian beliefs. By limiting access to certain teachings and practices to initiated members, early Christian leaders could ensure that the core tenets of the faith were preserved and passed down accurately.  Despite the emphasis on secrecy, early Christian leaders also recognized the importance of evangelism and spreading the message of Christ to others. Apostles like Paul traveled extensively to preach the Gospel and establish new Christian communities. The balance between secrecy and evangelism posed a challenge for early Christians, as they sought to expand their faith while also protecting themselves from persecution.  Over time, Christianity emerged from its secretive origins to become a prominent and influential religion in the Roman Empire and beyond. The adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century marked a significant turning point in the history of the faith. The once-persecuted minority had become the dominant religious force in the Western world, shaping art, culture, and society for centuries to come.  In conclusion, Christianity's early teachings and the practice of secrecy were essential components in the formation and spread of the faith. The teachings of Jesus Christ provided a moral and spiritual foundation for believers, while the practice of secrecy allowed early Christians to survive and thrive in a hostile environment. The delicate balance between secrecy and evangelism characterized the early Christian community and contributed to the growth and endurance of the faith. By understanding the role of secrecy in early Christianity, we gain insight into the challenges faced by the early Christians and the enduring legacy of their efforts in shaping the development of the Christian tradition.""","873"
"Burckhardt John Lewis","""Upon another island stands the tomb of a saint, called Sheikh Hassan el Merabet, with a few low buildings and huts round it, where a Bedouin family of the Heteym tribe is stationary, to whom the guardianship of the tomb belongs. The course of the Arab ships being usually close by this island, the crews often despatch a boat with a few measures of corn to those people, or some butter, biscuits, and coffee-beans, because they consider Sheikh Hassan to be the patron of these seas. When we sailed by, our Reys made a large loaf of bread, which he baked in ashes, and distributed a morsel of it to every person on board, who eat it in honour of the saint, after which we were treated by him with a cup of coffee. In general, the Arab sailors are very superstitious; they hold certain passages in great horror; not because they are more dangerous than others, but because they believe that evil spirits dwell among the coral rocks, and might possibly attract the ship towards the shoal, and cause her to founder. For the same reason they observe the constant practice of throwing, at every meal, a handful of dressed victuals into the sea, before they sit down themselves to the repast; saying that the inhabitants of the sea must also have their morsel, otherwise they will impede the vessel s course. Our Reys once forgot this tribute; but on recollecting it, he ordered a fresh loaf to be baked, and threw it into the sea. We met every day, during this voyage, ships coming from Egypt, and often lay in the same bay with three or four of them, in the evening. On such occasions quarrels frequently happen about water; and ships are often obliged to wait one or two days before the Bedouins bring a sufficient supply down to the coast. Butter, milk, honey, sheep, goats, salt fish, firewood, thin branches of the shrub Arak, of which the Arabians make their tooth-brushes, and which the Bedouins collect on this coast, are every where to be had in plenty, and are generally exchanged for corn or tobacco. These Bedouins are daring robbers, and often swim to the ships during the night, to watch for the opportunity of pilfering. The water on the whole coast is bad, except at Wodjeh and at Dhoba. Wodjeh, which is usually reckoned at three days journey northward from Djebel Hassany, is a castle on the Hadj route, about three miles inland. Close by it is excellent spring water; and there are likewise copious wells of tolerable water in the vicinity of the small bay which serves as a harbour to the castle, and is therefore called Mersa el Wodjeh. Some Moggrebyn soldiers garrison the castle, which was said to be well stocked with provisions. Several of them were married to Bedouin women, and carried on a trifling trade in provisions with the ships that pass. The neighbouring mountains of Wodjeh are inhabited by the Bedouin tribe of Bily. To the north of Wodjeh, and about two days journey south of Moeyleh, lies the anchorage of Dhoba, renowned for its excellent wells. The anchoring-place is in a large bay, one of the best harbours on this coast, and the wells are about half an hour s distance inland, under a grove of palm and Doum date-trees. The route of the Egyptian Hadj passes here; and for its convenience, a birket, or reservoir, has been constructed. The ships that sail from Cosseir to Yembo generally make this point, and continue from thence their coasting voyage southwards. North of Dhoba two days, lies the castle and small village of Moeyleh, in the territory of the Howeytat and Omran Bedouins. We passed it at a distance; but I could see considerable plantations of date-trees near the shore. What is called the castle, appears to be a square building, upon the plain close by the water-side. The position of Moeyleh is distinguishable from afar by the high mountain just behind it; three pointed summits of which, overtopping the rest, are visible sixty to eighty miles off: I was told that in clear winter days they could be distinguished, from Cosseir, at the moment of sun-rise. Moeyleh is the principal position on this coast from Akaba down to Yembo. Its inhabitants, who are for the greater part Bedouins, become settlers, carry on a trade in cattle and fish with Tor and Yembo, and their market is visited by numerous Bedouins of the interior of the country. It is the only place on this coast where a regular market is kept, and where provisions are always to be found, and thus often affords timely relief to ships detained on their passage by contrary winds. Provisions being very dear in the Hedjaz, and very cheap in Egypt, ships, on leaving the Hedjaz harbours for Cosseir or Suez, never lay in more than is absolutely necessary; but the passage, which is usually calculated by them at twenty days, very often lasts a month, and sometimes even two months. From off Moeyleh, the point of the peninsula of Sinai, called Ras Abou Mohammed, is clearly distinguished. Ships bound from Yembo to Cosseir generally make this promontory, or one of the islands lying before it, and thence steer south to Cosseir. They do this, in order to take advantage of the northerly winds that blow in these parts of the Red Sea for nine months of the year; and they prefer the tedious, but safer mode of a coasting voyage, during which they often enjoy a land-breeze, to the danger and fatigue of beating up, in open sea, against the wind, or of standing straight across from Djidda or Yembo to the African coast; with the harbours of which, south of Cosseir, very few Red Sea pilots are acquainted, and of the Bedouin inhabitants of which they all entertain great fears. On reaching Ras Mohammed, they anchor near one of the small islands, or go into the harbour called Sherm, where they wait till a fair wind springs up, which usually carries them to Cosseir in one or two days. As for ourselves, we had not during the whole voyage any sort of disagreeable occurrence, though the wind, which was seldom fair, obliged us once to remain three days at the same anchorage; and I often expected the vessel to be wrecked, on seeing the pilot steer among the shoals in shore: a practice in which these people have acquired great experience, and in which they display as much boldness as they do cowardice in the open sea. After twenty days voyage we reached the neighbourhood of Ras Abou Mohammed, on the th of June: the boat was secured for the night with grapplings to some coral rocks, leeward of a small island ahead of the promontory; the pilot intending to strike across the next morning. As I knew that Bedouins were always to be found in the harbour of Sherm, to transport passengers by land to Tor or Suez, I wished to be set on shore here. The road from hence to Cairo was much shorter than by way of Cosseir; and my low state of health rendered it desirable to leave the vessel where I had not the slightest accommodation, and where the fears of the plague had not yet subsided, though no person had died on board during the last fortnight. For the sum of four dollars given to the Reys, and one to the pilot, they were kind enough to go a little out of their course, and on the following morning, the th of June, we entered the harbour of Sherm. Sherm is about four or five hours distant from the point called Ras Abou Mohammed, and is a good and spacious harbour, with anchorage for large ships; it lies at the entrance of the gulf of Akaba, and is the best harbour on the west side of that gulf. Under the name Sherm, or Sheroum, (the plural,) are included two harbours half a mile distant from each other, both equally good; but the southern is the most frequented. As a copious well is near, these harbours are often visited by ships coming from and going to the Hedjaz; and passengers who wish to save themselves a voyage up the Gulf of Suez, (which during the prevalence of the northerly winds is often of long duration,) land here, and are carried by the Bedouins upon camels to Tor and Suez. These Bedouins, living up in the mountains, see the ships from afar, and on their arrival hasten to the coast to offer their services. In former times, when the Pashas of Egypt exercised but a nominal power over the neighbouring Bedouins, the Arabs of Tor were much dreaded by the crews of ships; they enforced from them regular tributes whenever they entered their harbours, and conducted themselves in a very oppressive manner. At present, Mohammed Aly, through the means of the commander at Suez, has succeeded in overawing these Bedouins; their conduct is now very friendly, and travelling with them is perfectly safe: but if a ship happens to be wrecked on their coasts, or on the islands near them (no unfrequent occurrence), they still assert their ancient right of plundering the cargo. In the evening a ship came in, laden with soldiers, which left Yembo six days before us; the commander of the soldiers, and four or five of his party, were set on shore, to proceed by land to Cairo, and both vessels continued their voyage the next morning for Cosseir. There was no difficulty in obtaining camels; more than thirty were ready to be hired; and we started, on the evening of our arrival, in two parties, the one in advance composed of the soldiers, and the other, at about two hours distance behind, composed of myself and slave, and two fellow passengers, men of Damascus, who were glad of this opportunity of shortening their journey home. We rode this evening about one hour and a half in a valley, and then rested for the night. On the th of June we continued our road in barren valleys, among steep rocks, mostly of granite, till we halted, about noon, under a projecting rock that afforded us some shade.""","""Journey and trade along Red Sea.""","2199","""The Red Sea, known for its historical significance and strategic importance, has been a vital artery for trade and cultural exchange for thousands of years. The waters of the Red Sea have witnessed the ebb and flow of civilizations, connecting the Mediterranean world with the Indian Ocean and beyond. This pivotal region has served as a crossroads for trade routes, facilitating the exchange of goods, ideas, and technologies between different societies.  The Red Sea's rich history as a hub for maritime trade dates back to ancient times when Egyptian pharaohs sent expeditions to the land of Punt, a mysterious and prosperous region located along the Red Sea coast. The trade between Egypt and Punt involved the exchange of luxury goods such as gold, ebony, ivory, and incense. This early trade relationship set the stage for the Red Sea to become a vital trade route connecting Africa, Asia, and Europe.  As maritime technology advanced, the Red Sea grew in importance as a trade route. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and later Islamic civilizations all recognized the strategic value of the Red Sea, establishing port cities and trade centers along its shores. The port of Adulis, located in present-day Eritrea, became a key trading hub during the Axumite Kingdom, linking Africa with the Roman Empire and India.  One of the most famous trade networks that traversed the Red Sea was the Incense Route, which connected the Arabian Peninsula with the Mediterranean world. Frankincense and myrrh, highly prized commodities in the ancient world for their use in religious rituals and perfumery, were transported by camel caravans from southern Arabia to ports on the Red Sea. From there, the incense was shipped to markets in Egypt, Rome, and beyond, generating immense wealth for the traders and civilizations involved.  The rise of Islam in the 7th century further transformed the Red Sea region into a vibrant center of trade and culture. Muslim merchants from the Arabian Peninsula, Persia, India, and East Africa sailed the Red Sea, establishing commercial ties with ports along the coast. The city of Jeddah in present-day Saudi Arabia emerged as a key port for Muslim traders, serving as a gateway to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.  During the medieval period, the Red Sea continued to be a vital conduit for the exchange of goods and ideas between the East and the West. The Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt, the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad, and the Sultanate of Oman all vied for control of the lucrative trade routes that crisscrossed the Red Sea. Luxury goods such as spices, silk, porcelain, and precious metals flowed through ports like Aqaba, Suakin, and Jeddah, enriching traders and fueling the growth of urban centers along the coast.  European powers, eager to access the wealth of the East, also sought to establish a presence in the Red Sea region. The Portuguese, under Vasco da Gama, successfully navigated around the Cape of Good Hope in 1498, opening up a direct sea route to India that bypassed the traditional overland routes through the Red Sea. However, the Ottoman Empire and other regional powers retained control over key Red Sea ports and trade routes, ensuring that the region remained a vibrant hub of commerce and cultural exchange.  In the modern era, the Red Sea continues to play a vital role in global trade, with countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Eritrea reaping the economic benefits of the sea's strategic location. The Suez Canal, completed in 1869, further enhanced the Red Sea's importance as a major shipping route, allowing vessels to bypass the long and perilous journey around the Cape of Good Hope.  Today, the Red Sea region is home to bustling port cities like Jeddah, Djibouti, and Port Sudan, where goods from around the world are unloaded and transported to markets across Africa, the Middle East, and beyond. The Red Sea's waters teem with activity, with container ships, oil tankers, and cruise liners crisscrossing its expanse, connecting continents and facilitating global trade.  In conclusion, the Red Sea has been a vital lifeline for trade and cultural exchange for millennia, shaping the destinies of civilizations and fostering economic prosperity across the region. This ancient body of water continues to bind nations together through commerce and diplomacy, serving as a bridge between different cultures and peoples. The legacy of journey and trade along the Red Sea endures as a testament to the enduring power of maritime connections in shaping the course of history.""","922"
"Holbach Paul Henri Thiry baron d ","""In a material world the acting powers must be material: in a whole every part of which is essentially in motion, there is no occasion for a power distinguished from itself; the whole must be in perpetual motion by its own peculiar energy. The general motion, as we have elsewhere proved, has its birth from the individual motion, which beings ever active must uninterruptedly communicate to each other. Thus every cause produces its effect; this effect in its turn becomes a cause, which in like manner produces an effect; this constitutes the eternal chain of things, which although perpetually changing in its detail, suffers no change in its whole. Theology, after all, has seldom done more than personify this eternal series of motion; the principle of mobility inherent to matter: it has clothed this principle with human qualities, by which it has rendered it unintelligible: in applying these properties, they have taken no means of understanding how far they were suitable or not: in their eagerness to make them assimilate, they have extended them beyond their own conception; they have heaped them together without any judgment; and they have been surprised when these qualities, contradictory in themselves, did not enable them satisfactorily to account for all the phenomena they beheld; from thence they have wrangled; accused each other of imbecility; yet infuriated themselves against whoever had the temerity to question that which they did not themselves understand; in short, they have acted like a man who should insist that all other men should have precisely the same vision that he himself had dreamed. Be this as it may, the greater portion of what either Dr. Clarke or the theologians tell us, becomes, in some respects, sufficiently intelligible as soon as applied to nature--to matter: it is eternal, that is to say, it cannot have had a commencement, it never will have an end; it is infinite, that is to say, we have no conception of its limits. Nevertheless, human qualities, which must be always borrowed from ourselves, and with others we have a very slender acquaintance, cannot be well suitable to the entire of nature; seeing that these qualities are in themselves modes of being, or modes which appertain only to particular beings: not to the great whole which contains them. Thus, to resume the answers which have been given to Dr. Clarke, we shall say: First, we can conceive that matter has existed from all eternity, seeing that we cannot conceive it to have been capable of beginning. Secondly, that matter is independent, seeing there is nothing exterior to itself; that it is immutable, seeing it cannot change its nature, although it is unceasingly changing its form and its combinations. Thirdly, that matter is self-existent, since not being able to conceive it can be annihilated, we cannot possibly conceive it can have commenced to exist. Fourthly, that we do not know the essence, or the true nature of matter, although we have a knowledge of some of its properties; of some of its qualities: according to the mode in which they act upon us. Fifthly, that matter not having had a beginning, will never have an end, although its numerous combinations, its various forms, have necessarily a commencement and a period. Sixthly, that if all that exists, or every thing our mind can conceive is matter, this matter is infinite; that is to say, cannot be limited by any thing; that it is omnipresent, seeing there is no place exterior to itself, indeed, if there was a place exterior to it, that would be a vacuum. Seventhly, that nature is unique, although its elements or its parts may be varied to infinity, indued with properties extremely opposite; with qualities essentially different. Eighthly, that matter, arranged, modified, and combined in a certain mode, produces in some beings what we call intelligence, which is one of its modes of being, not one of its essential properties, Ninthly, that matter is not a free agent, since it cannot act otherwise than it does, in virtue of the laws of its nature, or of its existence; that consequently, heavy bodies must necessarily fall; light bodies by the same necessity rise; fire must burn; man must experience good and evil, according to the quality of the beings whose action he experiences. Tenthly, that the power or the energy of matter, has no other bounds than those which are prescribed by its own existence. Eleventhly, that wisdom, justice, goodness, &c. are qualities peculiar to matter combined and modified, as it is found in some beings of the human species; that the idea of perfection is an abstract, negative, metaphysical idea, or mode of considering objects, which supposes nothing real to be exterior to itself. Twelfthly, that matter is the principle of motion, which it contains within itself: since matter alone is capable of either giving or receiving motion: this is what cannot be conceived of immateriality or simple beings destitute of parts, devoid of extent, without mass, having no ponderosity, which consequently cannot either move itself or other bodies. CHAP. V. Examination of the Proofs offered by,,, &c. If the evidence of Clarke did not prove satisfactory--if the theologians of his day disputed the manner in which he handled his subject--if they were disposed to think he had not established his argument upon proper foundations, it did not seem probable that either the system of Descartes, the sublime reveries of Malebranche, or the more methodical mode adopted by Newton, were at all likely to meet with a better reception; the same objections will lie against them all, that they have not demonstrated the existence of their immaterial substances; although they have incessantly spoken of them, as if they were things of which they had the most intimate knowledge. Unfortunately this is a rock which the most sublime geniuses have not been competent to avoid: the most enlightened men have done little more than stammer upon a subject which they have all concurred in considering of the highest importance; which they unceasingly hold forth as the most necessary for man to know; without at the same time considering he is not in a condition to occupy himself with objects inaccessible to his senses--which his mind, consequently, can never grasp--which his utmost research cannot bring into that tangible shape by which alone he can be enabled to form a judgment. To the end that we may be convinced of that want of solidity which the greatest men have not known how to give to the proofs they have offered, but which they have successively imagined has established their positions, let us briefly examine what the most celebrated philosophers, what the most subtile metaphysicians have said. For this purpose we will begin with Descartes, the restorer of philosophy among the moderns, to whose sublime errors we are indebted for the effulgent truths of the Newtonian system. This great man himself tells us, 'All the strength of argument which I have hitherto used to prove the existence of immaterial substances, consists in this, that I acknowledge it would not be possible, my nature was such as it is, that is to say, that I should have in me the idea of immateriality, if this incorporeity did not truly exist; this same immateriality, of which the idea is in me, possesses all those high perfections of which our mind can have some slight idea, without however being able to comprehend them.' In another place he says, 'We must necessarily conclude from this alone, that because I exist, and have the idea of immateriality, that is to say, of a most perfect being, the existence is therefore most evidently demonstrated.' There are not, perhaps, many except Descartes himself, to whom this would appear quite so conclusive; who would be impressed with the conviction which he seems to imagine is so very substantive. First, We shall reply to Descartes, it is not a warrantable deduction, that because we have an idea of a thing, we must therefore conclude it exists; to give validity to such a mode of reasoning would be productive of the greatest mischief; would, in fact, tend to subvert all human institutions. Our imagination presents us with the idea of a sphinx, or of an hippogriff, besides a thousand other fantastical beings; are we, on that authority, to insist that these things really exist? Is the mere circumstance of our having an idea of various parts of nature, discrepantly jumbled together, without any other evidence as to the assemblage, a sufficient warrantry for calling upon mankind to accredit the existence of such heterogeneous masses? If a philosopher of the most consummate experience, of the greatest celebrity, one who enjoyed the confidence of mankind above every other, was to detail the faculties and perfections of these visionary beings, although he should hold them forth as the perfection of all natural combinations, would, I say, any reasonable being lend himself to the asseveration? Secondly, It is obvious that the mere circumstance of existence, does not prove the absolute existence of any thing anterior to itself; although in man, as well as the other beings of nature, it is evidence that something has existed before him. If this argument was to be admitted, are they aware how far it, would carry them? To maintain that the existence of one being demonstrably proves the existence of an anterior being, would be, in fact, denying that any thing was self-existent. The fallacy of such a position is too glaring to need refutation. Thirdly, It is not possible he should have a distinct, positive idea of immateriality, of which be, as well as the theologian, labours to prove the existence.""","""The nature of matter and existence.""","1993","""Matter has long been a fundamental concept in our understanding of the universe and our existence within it. At its core, matter encompasses everything we interact with, from the smallest subatomic particles to the vast galaxies scattered across the cosmos. Our exploration of the nature of matter has deepened our knowledge of the physical world and has provided us with insights into the very fabric of reality itself.  In the realm of particle physics, matter is described in terms of elementary particles. These particles, such as quarks, leptons, and bosons, are the building blocks of the universe. Through intricate interactions governed by fundamental forces like gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force, these particles come together to form atoms, molecules, and ultimately, all the tangible objects we encounter in our daily lives.  The existence of matter raises profound questions about the nature of reality. Philosophers, scientists, and thinkers throughout history have debated the essence of matter and its relationship to existence. One of the central questions is whether matter is the primary substance of the universe or if there are deeper levels of reality beyond the material world.  In ancient times, the Greek philosophers pondered the nature of matter, proposing different theories to explain the physical world. Thales of Miletus believed that water was the fundamental substance, while Anaximenes suggested that everything emerged from air. These early attempts to understand the nature of matter laid the groundwork for future scientific inquiry.  The advent of modern science revolutionized our understanding of matter and existence. The development of quantum mechanics and relativity in the early 20th century brought about a paradigm shift in physics. Quantum theory introduced the concept of wave-particle duality, challenging our traditional notions of discrete particles and deterministic behavior. At the same time, relativity theory revealed the interconnectedness of space and time, leading to a deeper understanding of the fabric of the universe.  As we delve deeper into the nature of matter, we encounter the strange and fascinating world of quantum phenomena. Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter on the smallest scales, where particles can exist in superposition states and exhibit entanglement, a phenomenon where particles become interconnected regardless of the distance between them. These peculiar properties defy our classical intuitions about the nature of reality and have profound implications for our understanding of existence.  The study of matter also extends beyond the realm of physics into other scientific disciplines. Chemistry explores the interactions of atoms and molecules, uncovering the mechanisms behind chemical reactions and the formation of complex structures. Biology investigates how matter organizes itself into living organisms, shedding light on the processes that underpin life itself.  The exploration of matter and existence is not limited to the physical sciences. Philosophy and metaphysics offer alternative perspectives on the nature of reality, posing questions about the relationship between mind and matter, the existence of consciousness, and the nature of being itself. Eastern philosophies, such as Buddhism and Taoism, emphasize the interconnectedness of all things and challenge our dichotomous views of self and other.  In the grand tapestry of existence, matter plays a crucial role as the medium through which we experience the world. Our senses perceive the tangible manifestations of matter, from the solid ground beneath our feet to the ethereal beauty of a rainbow in the sky. Everything we see, touch, and interact with is composed of matter in various forms, constantly changing and evolving in a dynamic dance of creation and destruction.  The study of matter and existence continues to captivate the human imagination, propelling us to explore the deepest mysteries of the universe. From the intricate structures of atomic nuclei to the swirling galaxies in the cosmos, matter reveals its complexity and beauty at every scale. As we unravel the secrets of the universe, we are confronted with the awe-inspiring realization that we ourselves are made of stardust, interconnected with the vast cosmos in which we dwell.  In conclusion, the nature of matter and existence is a profound and multifaceted topic that encompasses the fundamental fabric of reality. From the microscopic realm of subatomic particles to the macroscopic expanse of the universe, matter permeates every aspect of our lives and shapes our understanding of the world. Through scientific inquiry, philosophical reflection, and contemplative introspection, we can deepen our appreciation for the intricate interplay between matter and existence, gaining insights into the mysteries of the universe and our place within it.""","877"
"Robertson Frederick William","""The subject of our exposition last Sunday was an essential portion of this chapter. It is our duty to examine now the former and the latter portions of it. These portions are occupied entirely with the inspired apostolic decision upon this one question--the comparative advantages and merits of celibacy and marriage. One preliminary question, however, is to be discussed. How came it that such a question should be put at all to the apostle? In the church at Corinth there were two different sections of society; first there were those who had been introduced into the church through Judaism, and afterwards those who had been converted from different forms of heathenism. Now it is well known, that it was the tendency of Judaism highly to venerate the marriage state, and just in the same proportion to disparage that of celibacy, and to place those who led a single life under a stigma and disgrace. Those converts therefore, entered into the Church of Christ carrying with them their old Jewish prejudices. On the other hand, many who had entered into the Christian Church had been converted to Christianity from different forms of heathenism. Among these prevailed a tendency to the the highest virtue consisted in the denial of all natural inclinations, and the suppression of all natural desires; and looking upon marriage on one side only, and that the lowest, they were tempted to consider it as low, earthly, carnal, and sensual. It was at this time that Christianity entered into the world, and while it added fresh dignity and significance to the marriage relationship, it at the same time shed a splendour and a glory upon the other state. The virginity of the mother of Our Lord--the solitary life of John the Baptist--the pure and solitary youth of Christ Himself--had thrown upon celibacy a meaning and dignity which it did not possess before. No marvel therefore, that to men so educated, and but half prepared for Christianity, practices like these should have become exaggerations; for it rarely happens that any right ideas can be given to the world without suffering exaggeration. Human nature progresses, the human mind goes on; but it is rarely in a straight line, almost always through the medium of re-action, rebounding from extremes which produce contrary extremes. So it was in the Church of Corinth. There were two opposite parties holding views diametrically opposed to one another--one honouring the married and depreciating the unmarried life--the other attributing peculiar dignity and sanctity to celibacy, and looking down with contempt upon the married Christian state. It is scarcely necessary to remind ourselves that this diversity of sentiment has existed in the Church of Christ in almost all ages. For example in the early ages, in almost all the writings of the Fathers we have exaggerated descriptions of the dignity and glory of the state of celibacy. They speak as if the marriage state was low, carnal, and worldly; and the other the only one in which it is possible to attain to the higher spiritual life--the one the natural state, fit for man, the other the angelic, fit for angels. But ordinarily among men in general, in every age, the state of single life has been looked down upon and contemned. And then there comes to the parties who are so circumstanced a certain sense of shame, and along with this a disposition towards calumny and slander. Let us endeavour to understand the wise, inspired decision which the Apostle Paul pronounced upon this subject. He does not decide, as we might have been led to suppose he would, from his own peculiarity of disposition, upon one side only; but raises into relief the advantages and excellencies of both. He say that neither state has in itself any intrinsic merit--neither is in itself superior to the other. 'I suppose, then,' he says, 'that this is good for the present distress. Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife. But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned: and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless, such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.' That is, I will spare you this trouble, in recommending a single, solitary life. You will observe that in these words he attributes no intrinsic merit or dignity to either celibacy or marriage. The comparative advantages of these two states he decides with reference to two considerations; first of all with respect to their comparative power in raising the character of the individual, and afterwards with reference to the opportunities which each respectively gives for the service of God. I. With respect to the single life, he tells us that he had his own proper gift from God; in other words, he was one of those rare characters who have the power of living without personal sympathy. The feelings and affections of the Apostle Paul were of a strange and rare character--tending to expansiveness rather than concentration. Those sympathies which ordinary men expend upon a few, he extended to many. The members of the churches which he had founded at Corinth, and Ephesus, and Colosse, and Philippi, were to him as children; and he threw upon them all that sympathy and affection which other men throw upon their own domestic circle. To a man so trained and educated, the single life gave opportunities of serving God which the marriage state could not give. St. Paul had risen at once to that philanthropy--that expansive benevolence, which most other men only attain by slow degrees, and this was made, by God's blessing, a means of serving his cause. However we may sneer at the monastic system of the Church of Rome, it is unquestionable that many great works have been done by the monks which could not have been performed by men who had entered into the marriage relationship. Such examples of heroic Christian effort as are seen in the lives of St. Bernard, of Francis Xavier, and many others, are scarcely ever to be found except in the single state. The forlorn hope in battle, as well as in the cause of Christianity, must consist of men who have no domestic relationships to divide their devotion, who will leave no wife nor children to mourn over their loss. Let this great truth bring its improvement to those who, either of their own choice, or by the force of circumstances, are destined hereafter to live a single life on earth; and, instead of yielding to that feeling so common among mankind--the feeling of envy at another's happiness--instead of becoming gloomy, and bitter and censorious, let them remember what the Bible has to tell of the deep significance of the Virgin Mary's life--let them reflect upon the snares and difficulties from which they are saved--let them consider how much more time and money they can give to God--that they are called to the great work of serving Causes, of entering into public questions, while others spend their time and talents only upon themselves. The state of single life, however we may be tempted to think lightly of it, is a state that has peculiar opportunities of deep blessedness.. On the other hand, the Apostle Paul brings forward, into strong relief, the blessedness and advantages of the marriage state. He tells us that it is a type of the union between the Redeemer and the Church. But as this belongs to another part of the subject, we shall not enter into it now. But we observe, that men in general, must have their sympathies drawn out step by step, little by little. We do not rise to philanthropy all at once. We begin with personal, domestic, particular affections. And not only is it true that rarely can any man have the whole of his love drawn out except through this domestic state, but, also, it is to be borne in mind that those who have entered into this relationship have also their own peculiar advantages. It is true that in the marriage-life, interrupted as it is by daily cares and small trifles, those works of Christian usefulness cannot be so continuously carried on as in the other. But is there not a deep meaning to be learned from the old expression--that celibacy is an angelic state? that it is preternatural, and not natural? that the goodness which is induced by it is not, so to speak, the natural goodness of Humanity, but such a goodness as God scarcely intended? Who of us cannot recollect a period of his history when all his time was devoted to the cause of Christ; when all his money was given to the service of God; and when we were tempted to look down upon those who were less ardent than ourselves, as if they were not Christians? But now the difficulties of life have come upon us; we have become involved in the trifles and the smallness of social domestic existence; and these have made us less devoted perhaps, less preternatural, less angelic--but more human, better fitted to enter into the daily cares and small difficulties of our ordinary humanity. And this has been represented to us by two great lives--one human, the other divine--one, the life of John the Baptist, and the other, of Jesus Christ. In both these cases is verified the saying, that 'Wisdom is justified of all her children.' Those who are wisdom's children--the truly wise--will recognise an even wisdom in both these lives; they will see that there are cases in which a solitary life is to be chosen for the sake of God; while there are other cases in which a social life becomes our bounden duty. But it should be specially observed here that that Life which has been given to us as a specimen of life for all, was a social, a human Life. Christ did not refuse to mix with the common joys and common sorrows of Humanity. He was present at the marriage-feast, and by the bier of the widow's son.""","""Celibacy versus Marriage in Christianity""","2018","""In Christianity, the concepts of celibacy and marriage represent two significant paths believers may choose as they navigate their relationships with faith and the divine. Both celibacy and marriage hold unique roles and values within the Christian tradition, offering individuals distinct opportunities for spiritual growth, service, and connection with God. Understanding the differences, purposes, and implications of celibacy and marriage can provide insights into how Christians navigate their personal journeys of faith.  Celibacy, as a practice of abstaining from marriage and sexual relations, has deep roots in Christian history and theology. Within the context of religious life, celibacy is often associated with clergy, monks, nuns, and other individuals who dedicate themselves fully to God's service. By renouncing marriage and worldly attachments, celibate individuals prioritize their spiritual journey above all else, seeking a deeper union with God through prayer, meditation, and service to others. The choice of celibacy is seen as a way to focus entirely on God and the work of the church, free from the distractions and responsibilities of a marital relationship.  The practice of celibacy is based on the teachings of Jesus and the apostle Paul, who both spoke highly of the virtues of remaining unmarried for the sake of the Kingdom of God. In Matthew 19:12, Jesus acknowledges that celibacy is not a lifestyle meant for everyone but emphasizes its value for those who can accept it. Paul, in 1 Corinthians 7, also extols the benefits of celibacy, stating that an unmarried person is able to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the Lord's work without the divided attention that comes with marriage.  On the other hand, marriage is a sacred institution in Christianity, with roots in the creation story in Genesis where God established the union between man and woman as a reflection of His own love for humanity. Marriage is considered a holy covenant before God, where two individuals commit to love, honor, and support each other in a lifelong partnership. In the Christian context, marriage is not only a social and emotional bond but also a spiritual union that mirrors the relationship between Christ and the Church.  Marriage is celebrated for its ability to provide companionship, intimacy, and support within the context of a loving and God-centered relationship. The Bible affirms the importance of marriage in various passages, including Genesis 2:24, Ephesians 5:22-33, and 1 Corinthians 7:2, highlighting the significance of the marital bond and the responsibilities that come with it. Christian couples are called to love each other sacrificially, to respect and honor one another, and to build a family grounded in faith and love.  While celibacy and marriage represent two distinct paths in Christian life, both are viewed as valid and honorable ways to serve God and grow in faith. Celibacy allows individuals to focus entirely on their spiritual journey and service to God, while marriage provides a context for love, companionship, and the formation of a family. Ultimately, the choice between celibacy and marriage is a personal decision that should be guided by prayer, discernment, and a deep understanding of God's calling in one's life.  In conclusion, the concepts of celibacy and marriage in Christianity offer believers different avenues for expressing their faith, serving God, and cultivating relationships with others. Whether one chooses a life of celibacy dedicated to God's service or enters into the sacred covenant of marriage, both paths are valid expressions of Christian commitment and love. By understanding the unique roles and values of celibacy and marriage, Christians can discern how best to live out their faith in a way that honors God and reflects His love to the world.""","727"
"Stephens H Morse Henry Morse ","""What Prince Henry the Navigator began was continued by the enterprise of the Portuguese merchants. These men were not actuated by the high aims of Prince Henry; they were rather inclined to mock at his belief in the existence of a direct sea route to India. But with his discoveries along the African coast began the slave trade. It was found to be excessively profitable to import negroes from the Guinea coast, and the Portuguese captains and pilots soon mastered the difficulties of the navigation of the North-West shoulder of Africa from the frequent voyages which they made in search of slaves. In 481 King John II succeeded his father Affonso V upon the throne of Portugal. He was one of the wisest monarchs of his age, and was surnamed by his people John 'the Perfect.' By his internal policy he, like his contemporaries Louis XI of France and Henry VII of England, broke the power of his nobility. His people aided him, for they were wearied of the pressure of feudalism, and he concentrated the whole power of the realm in his own hands. He took up the projects which had been left untouched since the death of his great-uncle, Prince Henry the Navigator. The dream of his life was to find the direct sea route to India. To achieve this end he collected at his Court all the learned men he could attract; he improved the methods of shipbuilding, and began to build full-decked ships of 00 tons; he did much to perfect the knowledge of navigation; and exploration became his favourite hobby. John II dismissed Columbus as a visionary, and thus left it to Spain to acquire the fame and the profit of discovering the new world of America. But he was diligent in making enquiries, with regard to the East. He sent two of his equerries, Joao Peres de Covilhao and Affonso de Paiva, overland to India, and the former of these two travellers accompanied the caravans to the East and visited the Malabar coast. He was refused a passage from Calicut to Africa by the jealous Muhammadan merchants, but he managed to find his way through Arabia to Abyssinia, where he died. More important than these overland expeditions were those which John II sent on the tracks of Prince Henry's sailors along the African coast. One of his captains, Diogo Cao or Cam, discovered the Congo in 484, and in 486 Bartholomeu Dias and Joao Infante for the first time doubled the Cape of Good Hope and reached Algoa Bay. John II, like Prince Henry, was fated not to see the fulfilment of his dearest hopes; but he it was who designed the expedition which, under the command of Vasco da Gama, reached India, and who trained the great captains and governors who were to make illustrious with their valour the name of the Portuguese in Asiatic seas. It was in the month of July, 497, that a fleet of three ships was placed under the command of Vasco da Gama to follow the route taken by Bartholomeu Dias and find the way to India. Vasco da Gama was the third son of Estevao da Gama, who is said to have been the captain nominated by John II for the command of the expedition. Other accounts give to King Emmanuel, the successor of John II, the credit of choosing the successful admiral. Whoever selected him made a wise choice, for Vasco da Gama showed himself during his eventful voyage possessed of the highest qualities of constancy and daring. The two ships which sailed under his command, in addition to his own, were placed under his elder brother Paulo da Gama and his intimate friend Nicolas Coelho, who proved themselves worthy of their chief. The fleet, of which the crews did not number more than 60 men, nor the tonnage of any ship more than 20 tons, experienced terrific storms in doubling the Cape of Good Hope, but eventually Vasco da Gama struck the South-East coast of Africa. He met with opposition from the rulers of Mozambique and Quiloa (Kilwa), where he first touched, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that he suppressed an incipient mutiny among his sailors. In April, 498, he reached Melinda, a port situated 00 miles to the north of Zanzibar, where he was kindly received by the ruling chief. The passage across the Indian Ocean was well known to the navigators of the South-East coast of Africa, for there was a considerable amount of trade conducted between the two localities which was almost entirely controlled by Muhammadans. At Melinda, Vasco da Gama was able to obtain experienced pilots, and after a stay there of one month according to most authorities, and of three months according to Correa, Vasco da Gama pursued his way to India. The Portuguese ships arrived off Calicut in June or August, 498. The powerful Hindu ruler on the Malabar coast, who was known as the Zamorin, had his capital in that city. His body-guard and most of his aristocracy consisted of Nairs and Nestorian Christians, but all commerce was in the hands of the Muhammadan merchants. These Muhammadans were Moplas, or descendants of Arab traders who had long settled upon the Malabar coast. They quickly perceived that if Vasco da Gama could make his way direct from Portugal to India other Portuguese ships could do the same, and that then their lucrative monopoly of the Indian trade with Europe by way of the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf, would be at an end. They therefore intrigued with the Hindu ministers of the Zamorin to repulse the endeavours of Vasco da Gama to procure a cargo of Indian commodities for his ships, and it was only after much difficulty and some danger that he was able to take on board an inadequate amount of merchandise. On leaving Calicut the Portuguese Admiral visited Cannanore, and he eventually reached Melinda on his way home in January, 499. He had a long and difficult passage back to Europe; in the island of Terceira his beloved brother Paulo da Gama died, and when he got safely to Lisbon at the end of August, 499, he had with him but fifty-five of the companions who had started with him on his adventurous voyage. lim word Tmtiri or Tmri, which is a modification of the Sanskrit Smundri 'the Sea King.'] King Emmanuel of Portugal, and his people, received Vasco da Gama with the utmost enthusiasm. The dreams of Prince Henry the Navigator and of King John II were fulfilled. King Emmanuel took the title of 'Lord of the Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India,' which was confirmed to him by a Bull of Pope Alexander VI in 5/802, and he commenced the erection of the superb church at Belem as a token of his gratitude to Heaven. On Vasco da Gama the King conferred well deserved honours. He was granted the use of the prefix of Dom or Lord, then but rarely conferred; he was permitted to quarter the Royal Arms with his own; he was given the office of Admiral of the Indian Seas; and in the following reign, when the importance of his voyage became more manifest, he was created Count of Vidigueira. King Emmanuel determined to take immediate advantage of the trade route opened to him by Dom Vasco da Gama's voyage. On March, 5/800, a fine fleet of thirteen ships was despatched under the command of Pedro Alvares Cabral, well laden with merchandise, to trade with India. On his way out this Portuguese fleet was driven far to the westward, and to Cabral belongs the honour of discovering Brazil, which was eventually to become far more valuable to Portugal than the Indian trade. On leaving Brazil, Cabral followed the course taken by Dom Vasco da Gama, and with the help of pilots from Melinda anchored safely in the port of Calicut. At that place he established a factory or agency for the sale of the merchandise he had brought with him and for the purchase of Indian commodities, and then sailed for Cochin. But the Mopla merchants were still the declared enemies of the Portuguese. They raised a riot in the city of Calicut, and Ayres Correa, the Portuguese agent, was killed with several of his associates. It is worthy of remark that this murderous attack was entirely the work of the Arab Moplas. The Hindu Zamorin showed no disinclination to trade with the Europeans; the Malabar Muhammadans, that is the natives who had been converted to Islam, did not share in the outrage, and one of their principal merchants even interfered to save the lives of Correa's children and of some of the Portuguese clerks. Cabral then loaded his ships at Cannanore and Cochin, where Hindu Rajas, inferior in power to the Zamorin, but not so much subject to Mopla influence, ruled, and after burning some of the Indian ships in the harbour of Calicut he returned to Lisbon in July, 5/801. Cabral had not been so fortunate as Vasco da Gama, for he only brought back five out of the thirteen ships which he had taken with him. But, on the other hand, he did what Vasco da Gama had feared to do, and in spite of the fate of Ayres Correa and his associates, Cabral left a Portuguese factor with a considerable staff at Cochin to purchase goods for despatch to Portugal by the next fleet which should arrive. On the return of Cabral from India, King Emmanuel resolved to send once more to the East the famous captain who had discovered the direct sea route to India. It was obvious to the king that large profits were to be made by the Eastern trade, but at this early period he had formed no distinct idea as to the policy he would pursue. On one point only he was resolved. It was quite certain that Portuguese agents would have to be left at the places of export if a prosperous trade was to be developed, and it was therefore necessary to give a severe lesson to the Zamorin of Calicut for the murder of the Portuguese factor at his capital. Adequate protection to Portuguese agents could only be given by maintaining a strong force in the Indian Seas.""","""Portuguese Exploration and Trade in India""","2124","""Portuguese exploration and trade in India mark a pivotal chapter in the history of global commerce and maritime conquest. The 15th and 16th centuries witnessed an era of unprecedented exploration and expansion, with Portugal emerging as a pioneering force in the Age of Discovery. Led by intrepid navigators such as Vasco da Gama and Pedro Álvares Cabral, the Portuguese established vital trade routes to India, revolutionizing the dynamics of international trade and leaving a lasting impact on the culture and economy of the Indian subcontinent.  The journey of Portuguese exploration to India was sparked by the quest for new trade routes to bypass the Ottoman Empire's dominance over the traditional Silk Road. This desire for direct access to the lucrative spice trade was a driving force behind Portugal's ambitious maritime endeavors. In 1498, Vasco da Gama's historic voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to reach the shores of Calicut in India marked a significant turning point in global exploration. This pivotal expedition opened up a sea route that drastically reduced the cost and risks associated with trade between Europe and Asia, paving the way for an era of unprecedented commercial activity.  Upon reaching the shores of India, the Portuguese quickly recognized the immense potential of the region as a hub for lucrative trade in spices, textiles, and other luxury goods. They established fortified trading outposts known as """"feitorias"""" along the Indian coastline, with Goa emerging as the epicenter of Portuguese power in the region. These strategically located fortresses served as centers for commerce, diplomacy, and military operations, enabling the Portuguese to exert control over key trading ports and secure their dominance in the Indian Ocean trade network.  One of the most notable impacts of Portuguese presence in India was the introduction of new goods, technologies, and cultural exchanges that transformed the social and economic landscape of the subcontinent. The Portuguese brought European products such as firearms, textiles, and luxury items to Indian markets, while simultaneously introducing Indian spices like pepper, cloves, and cinnamon to European consumers. This exchange of goods not only enriched both the Portuguese and Indian economies but also facilitated the intermingling of diverse cultural influences that shaped the development of global trade networks.  In addition to trade, Portuguese exploration in India had significant geopolitical ramifications, as European powers vied for control over lucrative trade routes and sought to expand their colonial empires. The Portuguese Crown's establishment of a powerful naval fleet, known as the Estado da Índia, enabled them to assert dominance over rival powers and safeguard their commercial interests in the Indian Ocean. However, this expansionist agenda was met with resistance from local powers, leading to conflicts such as the Battle of Diu and the Siege of Goa, where the Portuguese army clashed with indigenous rulers for control over strategic territories.  Despite their initial successes, Portuguese dominance in the Indian Ocean trade network faced challenges from competing European powers, most notably the Dutch and British East India Companies. The rise of these formidable trading entities gradually eroded Portuguese influence in the region, leading to a decline in their political and economic hegemony in India. By the late 17th century, Portugal's grip on Indian trade had weakened significantly, paving the way for the emergence of new colonial powers that would shape the course of global history in the centuries to come.  In conclusion, Portuguese exploration and trade in India were instrumental in reshaping the contours of global commerce and cultural exchange during the Age of Discovery. The legacy of their maritime conquests lives on in the shared heritage of Portuguese and Indian traditions, as well as in the enduring impact of their commercial ventures on the development of a truly interconnected world. As we reflect on this transformative period in history, we are reminded of the enduring legacy of exploration and trade that continues to shape our understanding of the past and inform our aspirations for a more interconnected future.""","758"
"Spalding John Lancaster","""Let us not teach the young to believe they are born into a world of delights and pleasures, but let us strive to enable them to realize that, upon this earth, only the wise and good and strong can make themselves really at home; that for the wicked and the weak its very delights and pleasures turn to sorrow and suffering. We pity the hard-driven beast of burden. How then is it possible to look with complacency on a world in which multitudes of human beings are condemned to the work of the ox and the ass? For the healthy man, wealth and happiness would seem to be identical, if his desires are confined to the things of which money is the equivalent. But this is a delusion, for the plenary possession of these things has never satisfied a human being. Man needs virtue, knowledge, love, and to take the obvious view, he needs the power to enjoy the things money buys; and of this money deprives him. When we consider the many unworthy means men take to gain wealth and office, we are forced to believe that to reach their ends they are ready to profess to hold opinions and beliefs about which they care nothing or which they really do not accept at all. By this following of time-servers and place-hunters every noble cause is weakened and the purest faith is corrupted. To labor for those we love, to sit in the hours of rest, with wife and children about us, smiling in the blaze of the fire we have lighted, sheltered by the roof we have built, secure in the sense of protection our presence inspires, is to feel that life is good. But is it not a higher thing to turn away, in disrespect of all this peace and comfort, and to strive alone, by thought and deed, to find the way which leads to God and to be a pioneer therein for those who wander helpless and astray? The more we dwell with truth and love, the more conscious we become that they are the best, and are everlasting; and thus our immortality is revealed to us. Visibly we float on the boundless stream and disappear; but inasmuch as we are truth-loving and love-cherishing, we dwell in an abiding city, and may behold our bodies carried forth by the flood, as a man sees his house swept away, while he himself remains. Our thoughtlessness and indifference, our indolence and frivolousness, blind us to the infinite worth and significance of life; and they who call themselves religious often take it as lightly as worldlings and unbelievers. In the Universe there is nothing which exists separate and apart from other things. The satellites hold to the planets, the planets to the suns, the suns to one another, all in obedience to the same laws which bind the body to earth, and cause the water to flow and the vapor to rise. For the senses there is separateness, but for the mind there is union and unity. Communion is the law of souls as of bodies. Both are immersed in a boundless world, from which if they could be drawn forth they would cease to be. The principle of this infinite harmony is love, is God. The right human bond is that which unites soul with soul; and only they are truly akin who consciously live in the same world, who think, believe, and love alike, who hope for the same things, aspire to the same ends. Our mental view never reaches the ultimate nature of being, and hence our knowledge, whether of material or of spiritual things, is incomplete. Faith is the effort to supply the defect which inheres in all our knowing. Knowledge springs from faith, faith from knowledge, as rivers from clouds, clouds from rivers. The more we know, the more we believe; and our growing consciousness does not make us content to rest in a mechanical view of nature, but it brings home to us with increasing power the awfulness of the infinite mystery, which we more and more clearly perceive to be a spiritual rather than a material fact. If at present there is a certain failure of will and consequent discouragement in the pursuit of moral and intellectual perfection, this is a result of our passing bewilderment in the presence of the revelations of science and of the mighty forces it places in the hands of man, and not of any new knowledge which tends to inspire misgivings concerning the being of God and our kinship with Him:-- From nature up to law, from law to love: This is the ascendant path in which we move, Impelled by God in ways that lighten still, Till all things meet in one eternal thrill. As the Universe revealed by the Copernican astronomy and the other natural sciences is infinitely more sublime and marvellous than such a world as the Israelites, the Greeks, or the Romans imagined, so they who see rightly in the luminous ether of modern intelligence understand better than the ancients that human life is not an ephemeral and superficial, but an immortal and central power, enrooted in God, and drawing its substance and sustenance from Him. The appeal to shame is a poor argument. The fact that men of great intellectual power and learning have held an opinion to be true does not make it so. New knowledge may have shown it to be false, or the general advance of the race may have changed the point of view. The presumption of the larger wisdom of the Ancients we cannot accept: for we, not they, are the true ancients. The purest and the holiest prayer men speak is this: 'Thy will be done.' They who utter it from the inmost soul, find peace, even as a fretful child sinks to rest upon the mother's bosom. In learning to love the will of God they come at last not merely to believe, but to feel that His will guides the Universe, and that all will be well. When an utterance comes forth from the depths of our spiritual being, men cannot but hearken. It is as though we should bring to exiles tidings of a long-lost home and country. To what a weight he stoops who addresses himself with fixed resolve to the life of thought! The burden indeed is heavy, but the pathway lies through pleasant fields where great souls move to and fro in freedom and at peace. And as he grows accustomed to his labor, the world widens, the heavens break open, the dead live again, and with them he rises into the high regions where the petty cares and passions of mortals do not reach. He who would educate himself must make use of his own powers. He must observe, think, examine, read, argue, ponder; he must learn when to hold judgment in suspense, and when to give the wings of the soul free sweep through the high and serene realms of truth and beauty. The farther we dwell from the crowd, with its current opinion, the better and truer shall we and our thoughts become. They who write for multitudinous readers rise with difficulty above the dignity of mountebanks. There is a radical defect in the character of whoever works in the spirit of a trifler, however blameless his conduct. The power to inspire faith in the seriousness and goodness of life is a sufficient test of the worth of a scheme of education. No one should fill an office which he is unable to hold without hindrance to the play of mind and heart that makes him a man. The dignities we possess at the cost of knowledge and virtue are like jewels for the sake of which one goes hungry and naked; mere glittering baubles for which we barter the soul's prosperity. Experience is personal, and it is largely incommunicable; but genius--and in this lies its power and charm--renders it communicable. What the poet or the painter has felt and seen, he makes all men feel and see. The difference between man and man, between the child and the youth, the youth and the adult, is chiefly a difference in feeling, in the manner in which they are impressed; and it is our nature to be drawn in admiration or reverence to those who by their words or deeds give us deeper impressions of the worth of life, and thus open for us new sources of feeling. Fair thoughts rise in the heart and mind of genius, like the fragrant breath which the dewy flowers exhale in the face of the rising sun, and they utter themselves as simply as matin songs warbled by sweet-throated birds. Faith in the infinite nature and worth of truth, goodness, and love, is the dawn which shall merge into the fulness of day, when, in other worlds, God looks upon the soul, reborn from out this seemingness. Our position, our reputation, our wealth, our comforts, are but a vesture like the body itself. They shall fall away, and we shall remain with God. There is no liberty but obedience to the impulse of the higher nature which urges us to think nobly, to act rightly, and to love constantly. The dominion of appetite is slavery; the dominion of reason and conscience is freedom. Renan somewhere says he could wish for nothing better than that a little volume of selections from his writings might commend itself to young women, whose fair faces should bend over it, and find there a reflection of their own pure souls. But where there is no God, the soul is not mirrored, and we never really love an author who weakens faith and hope. With whatever success we advance towards the wide and serene life of the pure reason, let us still cling to faith, hope, and love, the primal powers which keep watch at our birth, and which bend over our cradles, and which alone lift us into the world of enduring peace and hold us within the sheltering arms of God. In the enlightened mind, faith is a higher virtue than it can be for the ignorant, and to sustain it there is need of a nobler life. He whom neither learning nor power nor wealth can corrupt must have virtue; for learning breeds conceit, and power begets pride, and wealth debases both the mind and heart. The intellect does not recognize that conscience may forbid its exercise, since knowledge cannot be evil.""","""The nature of virtue and life""","2088","""Virtue, a concept that has fascinated philosophers, theologians, and individuals across cultures and eras, embodies the essence of human morality and character. Rooted in ancient Greek philosophy with seminal works by thinkers like Plato and Aristotle, virtue has endured as a timeless ideal guiding ethical behavior and defining the quality of one's life. At its core, virtue encompasses moral excellence, integrity, and adherence to principles that uphold the common good. It is through the cultivation of virtue that individuals not only enhance their own lives but also contribute positively to society as a whole.  Central to the understanding of virtue is Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia, often translated as """"happiness"""" or """"flourishing."""" For Aristotle, virtue is not merely a set of rules or actions but a way of living that leads to a fulfilled and meaningful life. He posited that human flourishing comes from the cultivation of intellectual and moral virtues, which enable individuals to realize their full potential and lead a life of excellence. Virtue, therefore, is not a passive state but an active pursuit that requires conscious effort, self-awareness, and a commitment to personal growth.  A key aspect of virtue is its universality transcending cultural and societal boundaries. While specific virtues may vary across different belief systems and traditions, the fundamental principles of integrity, courage, wisdom, and justice remain constant. Virtue serves as a moral compass that guides individuals in navigating complex ethical dilemmas and making decisions that align with their values and beliefs. In a world characterized by rapid change and moral ambiguity, the enduring relevance of virtue provides a stable foundation for ethical conduct and responsible living.  The cultivation of virtue is a lifelong journey marked by challenges, setbacks, and moments of growth. Through reflection, self-discipline, and practice, individuals can nurture virtues such as compassion, honesty, humility, and resilience, which not only enhance their own well-being but also contribute to the greater good. Virtue ethics, as a philosophical approach emphasizing the importance of character and moral integrity, offers a holistic framework for assessing human actions and guiding ethical decision-making.  In contemporary society, where material success and external validation often overshadow inner virtues, the revival of interest in virtue ethics signifies a yearning for deeper meaning and fulfillment. In a world driven by individualism and instant gratification, the pursuit of virtue offers a path towards personal authenticity, ethical integrity, and emotional well-being. The cultivation of virtues such as empathy, courage, and social responsibility fosters a sense of connection with others and a commitment to creating a more just and compassionate world.  Virtue, however, is not without its complexities and nuances. The nature of virtue is multifaceted, influenced by individual beliefs, cultural norms, and societal expectations. What may be considered virtuous in one context might be perceived differently in another, highlighting the subjective nature of moral values and ethical standards. Additionally, the interplay between virtues, vices, and situational factors often complicates ethical decision-making, requiring individuals to navigate moral gray areas with prudence and discernment.  Moreover, the realization of virtue is an ongoing process that requires reflection, self-examination, and a willingness to learn from one's mistakes. As imperfect beings, humans are prone to moral failings and ethical lapses, underscoring the need for humility, forgiveness, and a commitment to personal growth. The cultivation of virtue is not about achieving perfection but about striving towards excellence and moral improvement in the face of adversity and challenges.  Ultimately, the nature of virtue is intertwined with the essence of human life itself. Virtue shapes not only our actions and choices but also our relationships, aspirations, and sense of purpose. It is through the practice of virtue that individuals cultivate a sense of inner harmony, moral integrity, and emotional resilience that sustain them through life's trials and tribulations. As Aristotle famously stated, """"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."""" By embracing the ideals of virtue and incorporating them into our daily lives, we can strive towards a more fulfilling existence characterized by wisdom, compassion, and ethical integrity.""","825"
"Holst Helge","""The conception of the relatively great importance of the atomic number as compared with the atomic weight has in recent years received overwhelming support from the researches of Soddy, Fajans, Russell, Hevesy and others who have discovered the existence of so-called isotope different radioactive of the nucleus, of the electron system in the atom. The credit for first recognizing the sharp distinction between these two classes, a distinction fundamental for a detailed study of the atom, is due to Niels Bohr. The properties of the nucleus radioactive processes, or explosions of the nucleus, and related processes; collisions, where two nuclei approach extremely near to each other; which, as mentioned above, stands in direct connection with atomic weight. The properties of the electron system are, on the other hand, the determining factors in all other physical and chemical activities, and, as has been stated, are functions, we may say, of the atomic number of the given element. The Bohr theory may be said to concern itself with the chemical and physical properties of the atom with the exception of those which have to do with the nucleus. We shall consequently devote our attention in the next chapters to the electron system. But before turning to this we shall dwell a little further upon the atomic nucleus. The Structure of the Nucleus. That the nucleus is not an elementary indivisible particle but a system of particles, is clearly shown by the radioactive processes in which -particles and - shot out of the nuclei of radioactive elements. Bohr was the first to see clearly that not only the -particles emitted in such cases come from the nucleus, but that the -particles also have their source there. There is now no doubt that, in addition to the outer electrons of the atom, which are the determining factor in the atomic number, there must also be, in the radioactive substances at any rate, special nuclear electrons which lead a more hidden existence in the interior of the nucleus. One can easily understand that isotopes may result as products of radioactive disintegration. For example, let us suppose that a nucleus emits first an - nuclear electrons, reducing the resultant positive nuclear charge from 4 to. Uranium, with atomic number 2 and atomic weight 38, should have a nucleus composed of 38 hydrogen nuclei and 46 electrons, and so on for the others. We see at once that the conception of the nucleus here propounded leads us back to the old hypothesis of all atomic weights should be integral multiples of that of hydrogen.""","""Atomic structure and nucleus properties""","502","""Atomic structure is the foundation of understanding the nature of matter. At the core of an atom lies the nucleus, a tiny but essential component. The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons tightly bound together, while electrons orbit around the nucleus in specific energy levels. Protons are positively charged particles, neutrons have no charge, and electrons carry a negative charge.   Protons and neutrons are collectively known as nucleons and are found within the nucleus. The number of protons in an atom determines its atomic number, which defines the element. For example, an atom with one proton is hydrogen, two protons is helium, and so on. Neutrons play a crucial role in stabilizing the nucleus by balancing the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged protons.  The nucleus is incredibly dense compared to the rest of the atom. It occupies a minuscule portion of the atom's total volume but contains nearly all of its mass. The size of the nucleus is on the order of femtometers, extremely small in comparison to the overall atomic size. This dense central core exerts a powerful influence on the atom's properties and behavior.  The nucleus is held together by the strong nuclear force, which overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between protons. This force is responsible for keeping the protons and neutrons bound together, creating a stable nucleus. The strong nuclear force is one of the four fundamental forces in nature, along with gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak nuclear force.  Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons in their nucleus. This variation in neutron number does not alter the element's chemical properties but can affect its stability and radioactivity. Some isotopes are stable, while others are radioactive and undergo decay over time, emitting radiation in the process.  Understanding the properties of the nucleus is essential in various scientific fields, including nuclear physics, chemistry, and medicine. It forms the basis for nuclear reactions, radioactive decay, and nuclear energy production. The study of atomic nuclei has led to significant advancements in nuclear technology, such as nuclear power plants and medical imaging techniques like MRI scans.  In conclusion, the nucleus is the central core of an atom, containing protons and neutrons bound together by the strong nuclear force. Its properties dictate the nature of elements and play a vital role in nuclear phenomena. By delving into the intricacies of atomic structure and nucleus properties, scientists continue to unravel the mysteries of the universe and harness the power of the atom for a myriad of applications.""","510"
"Leffingwell Albert","""It is now upwards of thirty-five years since the Act regulating the practice of vivisection in England came into effect. During all that period, in the United States, the law has never ceased to be an object of misrepresentation and attack. Before Legislatures and Senate Committees, on the platform and in the press, by men of good reputation but associated with laboratory interests, the English law has been denounced as a hindrance to scientific progress and a warning against similar legislation in the United States. And yet nothing can be more evident that all these attacks were based upon ignorance and misstatement. We find a Royal Commission in England, composed almost entirely of scientific men, everyone of them favourable to animal experimentation, devoting years to an inquiry concerning not vivisection only, but the working of the law by which it is regulated. And the conclusions reached are in every respect opposed to the statements made by the laboratory interests here. THEY THE OF, IN IS SO. But this is not all. Every recommendation made for modification of the Act is in the direction of animal protection, and toward an increased stringency of the regulations relating to animal experimentation. In not a single instance was there recommendation that the regulations should be less stringent; not an instance in which it was suggested that privileges of the vivisector should be enlarged. That this should be the result of an inquiry in this twentieth century, extending over five years, is remarkable indeed. Perhaps there is no reason for surprise that all these conclusions of the Royal Commission were never made known to the American public by the periodicals of the day. Is it possible for anyone to believe that such conclusions would ever have been attained if the denunciations of State regulation of vivisection, proceeding from the American laboratory, had been grounded in truth? XI THE A popular delusion is often the basis of a great abuse. If at one time witches were burnt by countless thousands, it was at a period when implicit faith in the reality of diabolic conspiracy was undisturbed by sceptical questionings. Human slavery existed for centuries, not only because it was profitable, but because it came to be regarded as the only conceivable permanent relation between the negro and the white man. The Spanish Inquisition existed for ages, because the pious Spaniard could not believe that the good men who upheld, encouraged, and promoted its activity could be liable to error, or actuated by other than the loftiest principles. Men find themselves deluded not merely because of their faith in the integrity of their fellow-men, but because they have also extended that faith to the accuracy of their opinions. There can be no doubt of the fact that public apathy regarding the abuses of vivisection as now carried on without limitations or restrictions is grounded upon the great anaesthetic delusion. This misinterpretation of facts, this misunderstanding of scientific statements, constitutes the most singular delusion of the present time. What is anaesthesia? It has been defined as a state of insensibility to external impressions, sometimes introduced by disease, but more generally in modern surgery by the inhalation of the vapours of ether or chloroform. The discovery of the properties of these drugs constitutes a very interesting chapter in the story of scientific achievement; but in this connection the chief point of interest lies in the fact that the most wonderful of all advances in medicine was made without resort to the vivisection of animals. Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson, an English scientist who had much to do with its various methods, tells us that 'the instauration of general anaesthesia came from experiments on man alone; there is no suspicion of any experiment on a lower animal in connection with it'; and Professor Bigelow, of Harvard Medical School, as we have seen, makes the same statement. The extent to which insensibility may be carried depends entirely on the amount of the vapour inhaled. Suppose the quantity to be very small. Then the result will be a diminished sensibility, without entire loss of consciousness. Let the quantity inhaled be considerably increase, and we may produce a profound stupor with muscular relaxation, the eyes are fixed, and the eyelids do not respond when the eyeball is touched. There is now deep anaesthesia, and complete unconsciousness to the surgeon's knife. The borderline between life and death is not distant; and if still more of the anaesthetic is administered, we may reach a condition from which there is no awakening. The skill of the anaesthetist is not unlike that of a pilot, who needs to know just how far the ship may be steered in a difficult channel without running upon the rocks. For a slight operation, a very little of the drug will often suffice. In some hospitals abroad--and perhaps in America--it is the custom not to give anaesthetics to charity patients when the pain is not greater than the extraction of a tooth. Between a light anaesthesia and the deep insensibility required for some capital operation, IS. We see the same thing in ordinary sleep. The deep unconsciousness of a thoroughly exhausted man is vastly different from the light slumber of an anxious mother, who is aroused by a word or touch. Yet both conditions are what we call 'sleep.' Now, one of the popular delusions regarding what is called 'anaesthesia' arises from ignorance of its innumerable degrees. We are told, for instance, 'anaesthetics were used' in certain vivisections. That assertion alone, in a majority of cases, will quiet any criticism. If 'anaesthetics were used,' then the average reader assumes that of course there was no pain. The experimenter may know better. But if ignorance persists in misinterpreting statements of fact, it is possible that he may think he is not obliged to make the truth plain, to his positive disadvantage. If such method of reasoning ever obtains, it may explain very much. And yet it would seem that only very ignorant people could be so blinded by authority as not to perceive where the fallacy lies. A slight amount of ether or chloroform may mean to a vivisected animal no protection whatever from extreme pain. The fact has long been known. Many years ago Dr. George Hoggan declared that 'complete and conscientious anaesthesia is seldom even attempted, the animal getting at most a slight whiff of chloroform by way of satisfying the conscience of the operator, OR OF HIM TO MAKE OF A.' In other words, it enables him to say, 'Anaesthetics are always used.' Shall we always be blind to the insignificance of that phrase? That chloroform or ether will suppress the consciousness of pain during a surgical operation, every reader is aware. But when we speak of certain vivisections, we are on different ground. The pains to be inflicted are sometimes far more excruciating than any surgical operation. In the stimulation of sensory nerves, and in various operations upon these nerves, there may be excited agonies so great that they break through the limited unconsciousness induced by chloroform. One of the most experienced vivisectors in America has given his testimony on this point. Speaking of his experiments upon some of the most exquisitely sensitive nerves, Dr. Flint says: 'WHEN we have used anaesthetics'--not the significance of the phrase--'WE PUSH THE TO THE OF THE ROOT OF THE. If an animal, brought so fully under the influence of ether that the conjunctiva had become absolutely insensible' (the degree of insensibility required by the surgeon), 'the instant the instrument touched the root of the nerve in the cranium, WERE OF PAIN.' Of other experiments upon the same nerves he tells us that 'in using anaesthetics, we have never been able to bring an animal under their influence SO AS TO THE. In cats that appear to be thoroughly etherized, as soon as the instrument touches the nerve, there is more or less struggling.' Flint's 'Physiology,' vol. iv., p. 7. Flint's 'Physiology,' vol. iv., p. 93. This statement needs to be remembered. The agony may be so keen, so exquisite, so far beyond the pain of a surgical operation, that it makes itself felt. Pain, then, conquers the anaesthetic, exactly as the anaesthetic usually conquers the pain. What, then, is the value of the phrase, ' WERE USED'? Dr. Hoggan has told us. It has no value whatever. Sir Thornley Stoker, President of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, and an inspector of laboratories under the Act, was questioned about the pain endured by an animal in course of a prolonged vivisection, and he frankly admitted that a vivisector 'could do no more than give an opinion. He could have no as to the entire absence, the continuous absence, of pain.' Dr. Thane, a professor at University Medical College, London, and a Government inspector, being asked whether one might not be able to distinguish between painful and painless experiments, replied that 'the inspector never could distinguish exactly which experiments were painless and which were painful, AND THE AND cannot distinguish IN A VERY OF.' Evidence before Royal Commission, Question,64. Ibid., Question,35/8. These are the opinions of experts. This attitude of uncertainty is the only ground possible for a scientific man who aims at stating the whole truth.""","""Animal experimentation and vivisection debate""","1916","""Animal experimentation, particularly the practice of vivisection, is a highly contentious and emotionally charged topic that has stirred debate for decades. On one side of the argument are researchers and scientists who argue that animal testing is crucial for medical and scientific advancement. They believe that it is necessary to use animals in research to develop new treatments and medicines, ensure product safety, and enhance our understanding of biology and disease processes. On the other side are animal rights activists and ethical proponents who argue that animal experimentation is cruel, inhumane, and unnecessary in today's world.  Proponents of animal experimentation often point to historical breakthroughs that have been made possible through research involving animals. Vaccines for diseases like polio, smallpox, and measles, as well as treatments for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, owe their development in part to animal testing. Without these advancements, millions of lives would have been lost or severely impacted. Animal research has also led to a better understanding of how certain diseases work and how they can be treated, benefiting both humans and animals.  Moreover, advocates of animal testing argue that there are strict regulations and ethical guidelines in place to ensure that animals are treated humanely during experiments. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) oversee research protocols to minimize animal suffering and ensure that experiments are ethically justified. Animals used in research are often cared for in state-of-the-art facilities by trained professionals to ensure their well-being.  However, opponents of animal experimentation raise valid concerns about the ethical implications of using animals in research. They argue that animals have inherent rights and should not be subjected to suffering for human gain. The suffering experienced by animals in laboratories, including pain, fear, and confinement, is a source of moral debate. Many animal rights activists advocate for the replacement of animal testing with alternative methods that do not involve animal suffering, such as computer modeling, cell cultures, and human-based studies.  Furthermore, critics of animal experimentation point out that not all research conducted on animals translates effectively to humans. The physiological and genetic differences between species can lead to misleading results and potentially dangerous outcomes when applying findings from animal studies to human health. For example, many drugs that have shown promise in animal trials have failed when tested in humans, highlighting the limitations of animal models in predicting human responses.  The debate over animal experimentation extends beyond ethics and efficacy to the broader question of whether it is necessary in today's scientific landscape. Advances in technology, such as organs-on-chips, 3D cell cultures, and artificial intelligence, are offering new ways to study diseases and test treatments without relying on animal models. These alternative methods not only have the potential to be more accurate and relevant to human physiology but also reduce the harm inflicted on animals in research.  In response to these concerns, there has been a growing push for the implementation of the """"3Rs"""" principles: Replace, Reduce, Refine. This framework promotes the replacement of animals with alternative methods, the reduction of the number of animals used in experiments, and the refinement of experimental procedures to minimize pain and distress. By adhering to the 3Rs, researchers can uphold ethical standards while continuing to advance scientific knowledge.  Ultimately, the debate surrounding animal experimentation and vivisection is complex and multifaceted, with valid arguments on both sides. While animal research has undeniably contributed to scientific progress and medical breakthroughs, ethical considerations and advancements in alternative methods raise important questions about the necessity and morality of using animals in experiments. As society continues to grapple with these issues, it is essential to find a balance between scientific advancement and ethical treatment of animals to ensure both human and animal welfare are protected.""","734"
"Ingram Kenneth","""The Catholic doctrine, however, while at first sight it appears to be identical with the Puritan, is actually quite distinct. For one thing there is a difference of attitude towards sin. Puritanism seems to suggest that those who have been 'converted' are actually perfect. It insists that they shall keep up this outward appearance, and consequently ensures that their sins must be committed secretly. They are then sufficiently perfect to ascend, after death, direct to Heaven. Catholicism, however, is continually recognizing that man is normally a sinner; the confessional is a public recognition of this fact. Catholicism therefore approaches the question of sex with the expectation that man will sin, that the probability of his fall is so great as to make it unnecessary and undesirable to hide all traces of his sin from public view. The Puritan attitude towards sex is really that of the prude. The Catholic Church is so ready to talk about sex in a decent manner that she provides the confessional as a permanent institution. When we turn to the Catholic attitude towards sex we are faced indeed with two significant dogmas which make up a position fundamentally distinct from that of Puritanism. The first of these is the doctrine that marriage is a sacrament, and the second that the esse of the marriage is the consent of the parties. The significance of the first is that marriage is not merely a licence whereby an unclean act is permitted as a sop to human weakness. The sex function, as the integral part of marriage, is acknowledged to be an actual objective of divine grace. The significance of the second doctrine is that wherever two people eligible to give consent, give it, there is the essence of marriage. Few non-Catholics realize that though the Church normally requires the ecclesiastical and civil regulations to be observed, she does not profess to marry the two persons; she merely pronounces a blessing on their marriage. She may make conditions before she will give her blessing or even her witness to the validity of the marriage; but she recognizes that a marriage may be just as valid on a desert island as in a cathedral. And hence she really regards adultery, not as does the Puritan, but as an act which should be sacramental but has been prostituted by the absence of the love-motive, or by becoming promiscuous rather than constant. Sexual union may even itself be of the nature of a marriage, and it is significant that the Church has always insisted on the right of parents subsequently to legitimize children born out of wedlock; it is the English law which has forbidden that privilege. This is the official Catholic doctrine, however much it has been assimilated to the Puritan conception by the personnel of the Church. Yet the Church has consistently upheld the celibate life as the higher vocation. She has represented a celibate priesthood as a greater ideal than a married priesthood. She has exalted Our Lady as a Virgin. She has insisted on the Virgin Birth. But she has done this, not because sex is evil, but because celibacy is better. And, as we shall see, religious celibacy is entirely distinct from a condition in which the sex impulse is merely repressed. Chapter: The General Principles of Purity In attempting to define these principles I have no desire to enter into a controversy of relatives and absolutes. It is sufficient to meet those who deny that there can be any abstract standard of purity by pointing out that we know the direction in which to look for what is good and pure. Just as we know that certain acts are less worthy than others, so we are aware of the general direction of the nobler activities. The first principle to be observed is that relatively purity is comparative. This is a commonplace of all personal estimates. However much we may adhere to the conception of a moral standard, which is abstract and unvarying, we realize that there are also personal standards which vary very much. We do not, for instance, consider a cat to be guilty of murder when she kills a bird; we do not execute her as we execute men who have taken human life. We do not even condemn lions or tigers as homicidal criminals, though we may kill them in self-defence, thus showing that it is not the distinction between taking animal and human life which constitutes the crime; it is the difference between the killers. Nor is it true that we draw a distinction merely between animal and human responsibility, for even in the human kingdom we apply a comparative moral standard; we do not consider a savage who steals or kills as being guilty to the extent which a civilized European would be who performed a similar act. We are in fact constantly applying a comparative standard to the comparative intelligences of individuals, and quite rightly, for all intelligence and moral sense is graded from brute-beast to savage-man and upwards. We must be careful not to avoid this standard of comparative values in approaching sex morality. So long as we admit that at least there are acts and principles which, taken in the abstract, approach purity more nearly than others, we must not judge all individuals by the same standard. We must not consider a very ordinary, unintelligent, animal-blooded young man as being excessively sinful for having a vivid sex experience; perhaps he is living right up to the level of his imperfect standard. We must not expect people to be more moral than they can be, though it is the duty of Church and religion to educate them to see that there are better standards. The second principle is simple, but of the deepest importance. It consists of the proposition that variety and not uniformity is the fundamental rule of nature, or, as Christians would hold, the intention of God. I cannot recall any distinctive attribute to which this rule does not apply. There are an infinite species of creatures, and infinite tastes and tendencies. Even if we narrow down our field of investigation to one nation or even a single family, we find that each individual is approaching life by different byways, with different prejudices and different temperaments and different conceptions. But throughout history the majority of the normal type has been inclined to flout this divine principle. The Puritans, for example, were a particular type who did not like the gayer life of the world, and preferred a stern evangelical atmosphere. Consequently they regarded those amusements for which they happened to possess no partiality, as evil, and whenever they had the opportunity they suppressed them; they eliminated Christmas and the mince-pie. Equally we can see that if the normal mechanical Teutonic type had said that it was unnatural for men to be artistic and had suppressed the arts, it would have been a disaster for the world. There is not one vocation, but there are many vocations; all types are the design of intention, and are there, not to be suppressed, but to carry out their particular mission. This again, is equally true of sex, and we must apply the same conclusions towards the many types which we shall presently meet, abnormal as well as normal. The Protestant, for example, really acknowledges a uniform sex-nature only. You will continually hear a Protestant declaring that it is unnatural for a man to be a celibate: this is, of course, pure nonsense. It might be unnatural for a normal sex-nature to remain celibate, just as it would be unnatural for a natural celibate to marry. The Catholic Church has been far wiser. She can offer the Religious Life to the celibate and the Sacrament of Marriage to the non-celibate. There are few types of individual more unintelligent than that which, while it cannot so interfere with personal liberty as to compel marriage, persists in uttering the convention that 'every man ought to do his duty to the State.' The truism is true; what is wrong is the failure to conceive that there is no uniform duty for every man. But the third principle is more complex in character, or, rather, in the considerations which it involves. It consists, really, of a re-affirmation as to the Catholic condemnation of the heresy of Manichism. The Puritan and the type he has evolved do radically regard the physical as evil. Protestantism, until it became adulterated by the Catholic movement, eliminated as far as possible, the physical medium in religious worship. Not only doctrinally, but liturgically, in the abandonment of ritual and artistic atmosphere, it attempted to limit religion as far as possible to the spiritual level, and it regarded sacramentalism as evil because sacramentalism involves an outward physical sign. In the same way the average Englishman, who has been inculcated, far more than he realizes, with Calvinist dogma, regards sex as immoral only when it is physical. A man may indulge in sexual emotion and thought, but so long as he suppresses any physical act he is not guilty; if this can be regarded as an exaggeration it is certainly true that popular Protestant theology regards a man as more immoral if he commits the physical sex-act than if he thinks of it. It is strange to note how far this theory has departed from the teaching of Christ, Who declared that 'he that lusteth against a woman hath committed adultery against her in his heart.' It is obvious the moment we examine this conception that it is utterly indefensible. If the sex-act is evil because it is physical, then it is equally evil to eat or drink. And if an attempt is made to avoid this difficulty by saying that it is evil to debase love by expressing it in a physical act, or that it is better to love spiritually and non-physically, then it is equally evil to debase artistic inspiration by expressing it with paints on a physical canvas, or better to allow melodies to float in one's mind than to reduce them to the level of a physical composition.""","""Catholicism vs. Puritanism on Sexuality""","1996","""Catholicism and Puritanism are two distinct branches of Christianity with differing perspectives and teachings on sexuality. These two traditions have shaped the moral and ethical frameworks around human intimacy, leading to contrasting views on how sexuality should be approached, understood, and practiced.  Catholicism, with its roots in the teachings of Jesus Christ and the early Christian church, has developed a comprehensive moral theology that addresses various aspects of human life, including sexuality. Central to Catholic teaching on sexuality is the belief that it is a gift from God to be enjoyed within the context of marriage. The Catholic Church emphasizes the importance of marital fidelity, mutual love, and respect between spouses. Sexuality is seen as a beautiful and sacred part of human nature, intended to express love, unity, and procreation within the bonds of matrimony.  Puritanism, on the other hand, emerged as a religious reform movement within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries, emphasizing strict moral codes and a puritanical approach to life. Puritans viewed sexuality through a lens of sin and temptation, associating it with impurity and moral degradation. Sexual desires were often seen as inherently sinful, and any form of sexual activity outside of marriage was condemned as immoral and punishable.  One key difference between Catholicism and Puritanism lies in their attitudes towards sex within marriage. While Catholicism promotes the idea of sex as a unifying and procreative act between spouses, Puritanism often viewed sex within marriage primarily as a means of reproduction, with an emphasis on duty rather than pleasure. Puritans were known for their conservative views on sexuality, advocating for abstinence, modesty, and strict adherence to moral codes in all aspects of life, including intimate relationships.  Another notable distinction between Catholicism and Puritanism is their approach to issues such as contraception, divorce, and homosexuality. The Catholic Church maintains a strict stance against artificial contraception, divorce, and same-sex relationships, viewing these practices as contrary to natural law and the sanctity of marriage. Puritanism, while also condemning these behaviors, may have approached them with an even greater sense of severity and condemnation, reflecting a more rigid interpretation of moral standards.  In terms of gender roles and expectations, both Catholicism and Puritanism have traditionally upheld traditional views on marriage and family life. While women were regarded as equals in the eyes of God, there were distinct roles and responsibilities assigned to men and women within the family unit. Catholicism emphasizes the complementary nature of men and women in marriage, with each partner bringing unique gifts and qualities to the relationship. Puritanism, influenced by a more patriarchal worldview, tended to emphasize male authority and the subservience of women within the family structure.  Overall, the differences between Catholicism and Puritanism on sexuality reflect broader theological, cultural, and historical differences between these two Christian traditions. Catholicism, with its emphasis on sacraments, grace, and the inherent goodness of creation, offers a more holistic and positive view of sexuality within the context of marriage. Puritanism, characterized by its focus on moral purity, discipline, and strict adherence to biblical teachings, tends to view sexuality through a lens of sin and temptation, leading to a more restrictive and condemnatory approach.  While both Catholicism and Puritanism seek to promote moral virtue and ethical conduct in all areas of life, including sexuality, their divergent views highlight the complex and nuanced ways in which religious beliefs shape attitudes towards human intimacy. Ultimately, the differences between these two traditions underscore the diversity of thought within Christianity regarding the moral, ethical, and spiritual dimensions of sexuality.""","726"
"Aldini Giovanni","""By considering the course generally pursued in curing melancholy madness, hints may be suggested for an useful application of Galvanism in that disease, and data may be obtained sufficient to establish the different modes of application best fitted to the different cases. These ideas have engaged a good deal of my attention; and when I have finished the observations I have been for some time collecting, I flatter myself that I shall be able to communicate to the public some interesting information on the subject. In some cases of madness, as I found it impossible to apply Galvanism to the hands, which were confined, I employed the action of an arc directed to the mouth (Plate III. fig..), while another proceeded to one of the ears; or I applied a piece of money to the head, and communicated the Galvanism by the method already described (Plate III. fig..). It will even be necessary to try the effect of the Galvanic current, sometimes continued, and sometimes interrupted by means of the apparatus employed for diseases of the organs of hearing. It will be proper, in many cases, to combine moral with physical treatment, and not to neglect the other methods already known and practised, which may be used as very convenient auxiliaries. V. General reflections on the action and influence which Galvanism, considered in a medical point of view, exercises on the animal conomy. I shall not here speak of the variation in insensible perspiration, and of the increase of circulation, which, according to the observations of several physicians, are found to be produced by Galvanism. Similar phnomena, as is well known, take place during the administration of common electricity. I shall therefore confine myself to those effects which hitherto have been produced only by the action of Galvanism. I shall observe in the first place, that Galvanism, as already shown in the Experiments detailed in the Second Part, is capable of effecting a separation of the fluids, and even sometimes of protruding the fcal matters from the body. In the case of the decapitated malefactor, I found that when the arc was applied to one ear and to the lips, a very sensible portion of saliva was discharged from the mouth. This observation was confirmed at Genoa on the head of an ox, and in several other places on the heads of sheep. The phnomenon of the extrusion of the fcal matters from the trunk of an ox, by means of Galvanism, was observed also by Professor Mojon of Genoa, and his brother, to take place in human bodies. Considering the animal fluids separately, I have found that very great variations are produced in them by Galvanism. But before I give an account of the experiments which I made on this subject, I shall describe the apparatus I employed. The animal fluid destined to be exposed to the action of Galvanism is put into a glass by a wooden lid, having in it two holes equally distant from the centre. Two wires, one of brass and the other of plated copper, the upper extremities of which are bent into the form of a hook, pass through these holes in such a manner, that the lower extremities of them reach nearly to the bottom of the vessel, where they are bent at right angles, so that only a very small interval is left between them. The upper extremity of one is made to communicate with the bottom of the pile, and the other with the summit. In consequence of this arrangement the Galvanic fluid is obliged to traverse the animal fluid, by which means it exercises an action on it according to the distance of the wires, and by its action separates from its different strata sometimes one principle and sometimes another; and this secretion will be effected with more ease and in greater abundance, according as the action of the pile is stronger, and the capacity of the conductors more considerable. I. Having put into glass vessels four ounces of blood recently drawn from the vein of a person in good health, I left one of them exposed to the contact of the atmospheric air, and subjected the other to the action of the pile. In both these portions I observed a speedy coagulation of the crassamentum, and at the end of twenty-four hours the serous part was separated. The blood exposed to the action of the pile adhered so strongly to the two wires immersed in it, that it was difficult to separate them from the clot which was thus suspended in the aqueous fluid, but in the other vessel the clot remained at the bottom. II. I put two equal portions of bile, still warm, taken from the gall-bladder of an ox, into two glass vessels, exposed one of them to the contact of the air, and subjected the other to the action of the pile. After ten hours had elapsed, I observed that the bile in the latter had become so opake as no longer to afford a passage to the light; while the other portion, exposed to the atmosphere, retained its transparency and colour. I observed also a considerable disengagement of air, the nature of which I have not yet had an opportunity of examining. III. I took four ounces of urine, voided by a man in good health, exposed it to the action of the pile, and at the end of twenty-four hours found that the greater part of its constituent principles was separated. A portion of them was collected around the wires in such a manner as to form cylindric bodies of a considerable diameter, of which the wires were the axes. As the mass of the attracted matters increased, a portion fell to the bottom by its own weight. The cylinders were soon entirely destroyed, and the substances which formed them were precipitated by the least shock given to the vessel. I repeated this experiment lately in Mr. Wilsons anatomical theatre in Windmill-street; and I observed, at the end of eighteen hours, a great quantity of the molecul furnished by the urine adhering to the two wires. But at length, not being able to withstand the effect of its gravitation, it began to fall down, forming a sort of wedge, the apex of which was at the surface of the urine, and the base at the bottom of the vessel. IV. Instead of putting the urine into a common apparatus, if a glass syphon with two platina wires be employed (Plate III. fig..), the urine becomes limpid on the one side, and turbid on the other. The substance detached from the urine afterwards appears in the form of flakes, which are attracted by the platina wires. I observed this phnomenon for the first time in the company of those celebrated chemists Fourcroy and Vauquelin, while they were performing Galvanic experiments in their own laboratory. V. The substance above mentioned, which was precipitated to the bottom, when separated by filtration and dried, weighed about the fourth of a grain, and the fluid separated from it was of a greenish colour. On examining the earthy deposit of this urine, we obtained sulphate of lime by adding to it sulphuric acid. VI. Having exposed to the action of the pile, in the same manner, four ounces of urine voided by a person with jaundice, I obtained an earthy sediment, the weight of which was nearly equal to that above mentioned. The liquor separated from it was transparent, inclining a little to black. By the same chemical process I obtained sulphate of lime, though the sediment of the urine was somewhat dark, and afforded a portion of carbon and bile which inflamed in the fire. VII. Having repeated the above experiments with different kinds of urine, I observed in general, that Galvanism, by a peculiar attraction, separates from urine the sulphates and muriates united to a portion of the bile, and also to carbon, which in a great part are precipitated to the bottom of the vessel: the other part, which remains attached to the wires, exhibits a regular saline crystallization, of so singular a form that it seems worthy of becoming an object of further research to chemists. The examination of urine voided by persons labouring under different kinds of disease, seems to be an object sufficient to excite the curiosity of physicians. To expose to the action of Galvanism artificial aeriform fluids, analogous to those which act a part in the animal conomy, might also be attended with advantage. For this purpose it will be convenient to employ the apparatus represented in Plate III. fig., which was lately constructed, with great precision, by M. Dumoutier at Paris. The whole artifice consists in a vertical metal tube, which can be raised up or pushed down. It is furnished with a stop-cock, and the tub in which the apparatus is placed has another. If the inverted bell be filled with water, and connected, by means of the vertical tube, with the apparatus which is to supply the gas, on opening the lower cock, the water will descend in the bell, and its place be supplied by the gas intended to be subjected to experiment. From all the observations hitherto made, there seems to be reason to conclude, that the effects produced on the animal conomy by common electricity and by the Galvanic pile are different. The phnomena of artificial Galvanism give us some right to suppose, that a similar action is exercised by the Galvanic fluid circulating in the fluids and in the organs of living animals. In this point of view Galvanic researches may one day throw great light on the nature of secretion; and it may perhaps be found necessary, when remedies are administered, to take its influence into consideration: for it is possible that the action of these remedies in the animal conomy may depend on the establishment of such an arc between the system of the nerves and that of the muscles, as may not alter the natural state of the Galvanic fluid proper for the constitution of the individual to whom these remedies are administered.""","""Galvanism in medical treatment""","2042","""Galvanism in medical treatment has a rich history dating back to the 18th century when Luigi Galvani, an Italian physician, first discovered the effects of electricity on the nervous system. This groundbreaking revelation laid the foundation for a new era in medical science, where electrical currents were utilized to treat various ailments and conditions. Galvanism refers to the therapeutic application of electric currents to stimulate muscles, nerves, and tissues in the human body. Over the years, this form of treatment has evolved and expanded, offering new hope and possibilities in the field of medicine.  The basis of galvanism lies in the understanding of how electrical impulses can influence biological processes within the body. When applied correctly, these currents can trigger muscle contractions, improve circulation, relieve pain, and even promote tissue regeneration. One of the key benefits of galvanism is its ability to target specific areas of the body, allowing for localized treatment and precise control over the therapeutic effects. This targeted approach has made galvanism a valuable tool in managing various musculoskeletal disorders, neurological conditions, and chronic pain syndromes.  In modern medicine, galvanism is commonly used in physical therapy and rehabilitation settings. Electrical stimulation devices are employed to help patients regain muscle strength, improve range of motion, and accelerate the healing process following injuries or surgeries. For individuals recovering from orthopedic procedures, such as joint replacements or ligament repairs, galvanic stimulation can play a crucial role in restoring mobility and function. By stimulating the underlying muscles and nerves, this form of therapy aids in re-educating the affected tissues and facilitating recovery.  Galvanism is also utilized in the management of chronic pain conditions, such as neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and low back pain. By modulating the transmission of pain signals along the nervous system, electrical stimulation can provide relief and improve overall quality of life for patients dealing with persistent discomfort. Furthermore, the analgesic effects of galvanism can reduce the reliance on pain medications, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse side effects and dependency issues.  In addition to its applications in physical rehabilitation and pain management, galvanism has shown promise in the treatment of certain neurological disorders. Conditions like stroke, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis can benefit from targeted electrical stimulation to enhance motor function, promote neuronal connectivity, and support neuroplasticity. Through the precise calibration of electrical currents, healthcare providers can tailor treatment protocols to address the specific needs of patients with neurological impairments, fostering recovery and functional improvement.  In the realm of wound healing, galvanism has proven to be a valuable adjunct therapy for promoting tissue repair and regeneration. By stimulating cell proliferation and circulation, electrical currents can expedite the healing process for chronic wounds, ulcers, and burns. This accelerated tissue repair not only enhances the overall healing outcome but also reduces the risk of infections and complications associated with delayed wound closure. Moreover, galvanic stimulation has been found to have antimicrobial properties, further supporting its role in wound care management.  Beyond its therapeutic applications, galvanism has also made significant contributions to scientific research and medical innovation. Electrotherapy devices have been instrumental in studying the physiological mechanisms underlying muscle contractions, nerve conduction, and tissue regeneration. By experimenting with different waveforms, frequencies, and intensities of electrical stimulation, researchers have gained valuable insights into the complexities of the human body's response to external stimuli. This knowledge has paved the way for the development of advanced electrotherapy techniques and devices that continue to push the boundaries of medical treatment.  As with any form of medical intervention, the use of galvanism requires careful consideration and expertise to ensure safe and effective outcomes. Healthcare professionals specializing in electrotherapy undergo specific training to assess patients, design treatment plans, and administer electrical stimulation in a controlled manner. Individualized care is paramount when implementing galvanic therapy, as the optimal parameters for treatment may vary depending on the patient's condition, age, sensitivity, and overall health status.  In conclusion, galvanism remains a powerful and versatile tool in the realm of medical treatment, offering a spectrum of benefits across various healthcare domains. From physical rehabilitation and pain management to neurological rehabilitation and wound healing, the therapeutic potential of electrical stimulation continues to drive innovation and enhance patient care. As technology advances and our understanding of the body's response to electrical currents deepens, the role of galvanism in medicine is poised to expand further, opening new avenues for healing, recovery, and improved quality of life for patients around the world.""","905"
"Hazlitt Henry","""Surely no one would contend that this could happen without the previous effort! I must also question Spencers remark that with the cessation of strain the true association of ideas has an opportunity of asserting itself. The brain has no hidden mechanism by which it can separate the true from the false. To be sure, if we use no effort the most usual and strongest associations will be more likely to assert themselves, and it may be that often these will have more warrant than unusual and weaker associations. Outside of this, there is no superiority. But the main reason why we cannot follow the method of Herbert Spencer is that we are not all Herbert Spencers. His thought naturally tended to serious and useful channels. Consequently he did not have to force it there. If the reader is one of those rare and fortunate beings whose thoughts run only to useful subjects, and who always concentrate from pure spontaneous interest, I sincerely advise him not to force himself. And if such a being happens to be reading the present chapter I assure him he is criminally wasting his time, and that he should drop the book or turn to the next chapter with all possible haste. But if the reader numbers himself with the miserable majority whose minds are ever running away with them, he will find it necessary to use effort in thinking at least for a while. One remark of Spencer is undoubtedly true. This is that an effort to arrive forthwith at some answer to a problem, acts as a distorting factor in consciousness and causes error. And here, strange to say, his practice is in substantial agreement with the apparently opposite method of John Stuart Mill. For note that Mill speaks of again and again returning to it until it was cleared up. Both imply their agreement rather than state it outright; Spencer by his use of the word forthwith and Mill by his words again and again. Here the practice of both differs from that of the vast majority of men. Yet neither thinker seemed to be clearly conscious how it differed. The average he has just been confronted with a problem, may wrestle with it with all the vigor of a great thinker. But as he sees difficulties multiplying about him, he gradually becomes more and more discouraged. Finally he throws up the problem in disgust, contenting himself with the reflection that it cannot be solved, or that it will take somebody who knows more than he to solve it. A real thinker, however, if confronted with the same problem, will look for a solution from every possible viewpoint. But failing an answer he will not give up. Instead he will let the subject drop for a while, say a couple of weeks or perhaps longer, and then refer to it again. This time he will find that certain obscurities have become a little clearer; that certain questions have been answered. He will again attack his puzzle with energy. And if he does not obtain a complete solution he will once more put it aside, returning to it after another interval, until finally a satisfactory solution presents itself. You may fail to see any difference between thinking for two hours separated by two weeks, and thinking for two consecutive hours. As an experiment, then, the next time you come across a puzzle which you fail to solve at first tilt, write down all the unsatisfactory solutions suggested, and all the questions, difficulties and objections met with. You may leave this for a few weeks. When you return to it a few of the difficulties will look less formidable, and some of the questions will have practically answered themselves. (Of course some of the difficulties may look more formidable, and a few new questions may have arisen.) If a solution is not found at the second attempt, the problem may again be sent to your mental waiting room. But if it is only of reasonable difficulty a solution is bound, soon or late, to be discovered. It is difficult to say just what effects this change in thought, when apparently one has engaged in no reflection during the interval. The attempted solution probably gives a certain set to our minds. Without being aware of it we observe facts relating to our problem. Ideas which occur to us in other connections are unconsciously seen in their bearing on the unsolved question. In short, those proclivities of thought which have probably been caused unawares by experience make themselves felt. It may be imagined that if we think too much we will be liable permanently to injure our mighty intellects. This has sometimes happened. But there is no serious danger of it. Thinking on one useful subject for a long while will not hurt you any more than thinking on a thousand different useless subjects for the same period. But of course you should not try to concentrate when you are sleepy, when you have a headache, when some other bodily pain distracts your attention, or when your mind is in any way tired. If you attempt to concentrate at these times you will endanger your mental and physical health. Not only this, but the thinking done during such periods will be of such poor quality that it will be practically useless if not harmful. This applies even to cases where mental fatigue is almost inappreciable. Thinking done in the evening seldom approaches in efficacy the thinking done in the first hours of the morning. But you should always make sure your mind is actually tired. It may merely be tired of a particular subject. An objection of a different kind may be raised against concentrating at every opportunity. It has often been noticed that names have been recalled and problems solved when we were thinking of something else. It may be urged that such solutions would not have occurred when concentrating, because the exact associations which led up to them would not have been present. This is occasionally true. But there are still reasons why I must maintain my position. No matter how well a man may have trained himself to concentrate, there will always be short periods when his mind will wander, and these will suffice for any accidental associations. Moreover, the fact that these mind wandering periods occasionally do good does not excuse their existence. The most fallacious ideas, the most demoniacal practices, the most despicable characters of history, have occasionally done good. The fact is that for every useful association which occurs during mind wandering, ten associations just as useful will occur during concentration. The only reason useful mind wandering associations appear frequent is that they are unexpected, therefore more noticed when they come. It has been frequently said that many of the worlds greatest inventions were due to accident. In a sense this is true. But the accident was prepared for by previous hard thinking. It would never have occurred had not this thinking taken place. It is said that the idea of gravitation came to Newton because an apple fell on his head. Perhaps. But apples had been falling ever since there were apple trees, and had probably been falling on mens heads ever since men had acquired the habit of getting their heads in the way. The idea of the steam engine is supposed to have come to Watt while observing a tea kettle. But how many thousands before him had not seen steam coming out of kettles? The idea of the pendulum for regulating time occurred to Galileo from observing a swinging lantern in a cathedral. Think how many others must have seen that lantern swinging! It is probable that in all these cases the invention or idea had been prepared for, had been all but formed, by downright hard thinking in previous periods of concentration. All that was needed was the slightest unusual occurrence to make the idea complete and conscious. The unusual occurrence, the accident, which has so often received the credit for the invention or the idea, merely made it come sooner, for with the thinking these men did, it was bound to come eventually.... Of course I really do not seriously expect anybody to concentrate at every opportunity. I dont myself. I merely wanted to establish the fact that its the best thing. But every man, even the tired business variety, should set aside at least half an hour a day, or three and a half hours a week. I realize what a great hardship it is for some people to devote one-forty-eighth of their time to such a useless pastime as thinking. But if they will make the sacrifice for seven consecutive days they will find themselves bearing up nobly at the end. There is even a possibility that they may be encouraged to extend the time. V AND From time to time there returns upon the cautious thinker, the conclusion that, considered simply as a question of probabilities, it is decidedly unlikely that his views upon any debatable topic are correct. Here, he reflects, are thousands around me holding on this or that point opinions differing from mine wholly in most cases; partially in the rest. Each is as confident as I am of the truth of his convictions. Many of them are possessed of great intelligence; and, rank myself high as I may, I must admit that some are my equals perhaps my superiors. Yet, while every one of us is sure he is right, unquestionably most of us are wrong. Why should not I be among the mistaken? True, I cannot realize the likelihood that I am so. But this proves nothing; for though the majority of us are necessarily in error, we all labor under the inability to think we are in error. Is it not then foolish thus to trust myself? When I look back into the past, I find nations, sects, philosophers, cherishing beliefs in science, morals, politics, and religion, which we decisively reject.""","""Thinking and Problem-Solving Techniques""","1896","""Thinking and Problem-Solving Techniques  Thinking is a fundamental aspect of human cognition that allows us to process information, make decisions, and solve problems. Problem-solving, on the other hand, is a critical skill that involves identifying challenges, generating potential solutions, and implementing the best course of action. In this discussion, we will explore various thinking and problem-solving techniques that can help individuals enhance their cognitive abilities and navigate complex issues effectively.  **Critical Thinking**  Critical thinking is an essential skill that enables individuals to analyze information, evaluate arguments, and make informed decisions. To improve critical thinking skills, one must learn to question assumptions, consider multiple perspectives, and recognize biases. Techniques such as Socratic questioning, where individuals probe deeper into the rationale behind their thoughts, can enhance critical thinking abilities. Additionally, engaging in debates or discussions that challenge one's beliefs can help cultivate a more critical mindset.  **Creative Thinking**  Creative thinking involves generating innovative ideas, exploring different possibilities, and thinking outside the box. Techniques like brainstorming, mind mapping, or using analogies can stimulate creative thinking. It is essential to create an environment that encourages creativity by allowing for experimentation, embracing ambiguity, and fostering a culture of exploration. By combining divergent thinking (generating multiple solutions) with convergent thinking (evaluating and selecting the best solution), individuals can enhance their creative problem-solving skills.  **Systems Thinking**  Systems thinking is a holistic approach that considers the interconnections and relationships between various components of a system. This technique helps individuals understand complex problems by analyzing the underlying structures and patterns. Tools like causal loop diagrams or stock-and-flow diagrams can aid in visualizing system dynamics. By applying systems thinking, individuals can identify leverage points where small interventions can lead to significant changes within a system, making it a valuable problem-solving tool for addressing systemic issues.  **Analytical Thinking**  Analytical thinking involves breaking down complex problems into smaller components, identifying patterns, and using logic to draw conclusions. Techniques such as root cause analysis, SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats), or decision trees can assist in analytical thinking. By deconstructing problems into manageable parts and systematically evaluating each component, individuals can arrive at well-informed decisions and effective solutions.  **Decision-Making Techniques**  Decision-making is a crucial part of problem-solving that involves selecting the best course of action from multiple alternatives. Techniques like the pros and cons analysis, cost-benefit analysis, or the six thinking hats method can aid in making sound decisions. It is essential to consider factors such as risks, uncertainties, and ethical implications when making decisions. By employing decision-making frameworks and involving stakeholders in the process, individuals can make more informed and balanced choices.  **Design Thinking**  Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that focuses on understanding user needs, ideating solutions, prototyping ideas, and testing them iteratively. This technique emphasizes empathy, creativity, and experimentation in problem-solving. By adopting a design thinking mindset, individuals can develop solutions that are not only functional but also user-friendly and impactful. Techniques like empathy mapping, ideation workshops, and prototyping can facilitate the design thinking process.  **Emotional Intelligence in Problem-Solving**  Emotional intelligence plays a significant role in problem-solving by helping individuals manage their emotions, recognize others' feelings, and navigate interpersonal dynamics effectively. Techniques like active listening, empathy, and conflict resolution skills can improve emotional intelligence. By being aware of one's emotions and how they influence decision-making, individuals can approach problems with greater empathy, resilience, and communication skills, leading to more collaborative problem-solving outcomes.  **Collaborative Problem-Solving**  Collaborative problem-solving involves working with others to address complex challenges collectively. Techniques such as brainstorming sessions, group discussions, and team problem-solving exercises can foster collaboration.

"Ragozin Zénaïde A  Zénaïde Alexeïevna ",""". The epic carries us back to the time when Erech was the capital of Shumir, and when the land was under the dominion of the Elamite conquerors, not passive or content, but striving manfully for deliverance. We may imagine the struggle to have been shared and headed by the native kings, whose memory would be gratefully treasured by later generations, and whose exploits would naturally become the theme of household tradition and poets' recitations. So much for the bare historical groundwork of the poem. It is easily to be distinguished from the rich by-play of fiction and wonderful adventure gradually woven into it from the ample fund of national myths and legends, which have gathered around the name of one hero-king, or, said to be a native of the ancient city of and a direct descendant of the last antediluvian king HASISADRA, the same whom Berosus calls Xisuthros.. It is unfortunate that the first tablet and the top part of the second are missing, for thus we lose the opening of the poem, which would probably give us valuable historical indications. What there is of the second tablet shows the city of Erech groaning under the tyranny of the Elamite conquerors. Erech had been governed by the divine Dumuzi, the husband of the goddess Ishtar. He had met an untimely and tragic death, and been succeeded by Ishtar, who had not been able, however, to make a stand against the foreign invaders, or, as the text picturesquely expresses it, 'to hold up her head against the foe.' Izdubar, as yet known to fame only as a powerful and indefatigable huntsman, then dwelt at Erech, where he had a singular dream. It seemed to him that the stars of heaven fell down and struck him on the back in their fall, while over him stood a terrible being, with fierce, threatening countenance and claws like a lion's, the sight of whom paralyzed him with fear. 0. Deeply impressed with this dream, which appeared to him to portend strange things, Izdubar sent forth to all the most famous seers and wise men, promising the most princely rewards to whoever would interpret it for him: he should be ennobled with his family; he should take the high seat of honor at the royal feasts; he should be clothed in jewels and gold; he should have seven beautiful wives and enjoy every kind of distinction. But there was none found of wisdom equal to the task of reading the vision. At length he heard of a wonderful sage, named EABANI, far-famed for 'his wisdom in all things and his knowledge of all that is either visible or concealed,' but who dwelt apart from mankind, in a distant wilderness, in a cave, amidst the beasts of the forest. 'With the gazelles he ate his food at night, with the beasts of the field he associated in the daytime, with the living things of the waters his heart rejoiced.' This strange being is always represented on the Babylonian cylinders as a Man-Bull, with horns on his head and a bull's feet and tail. He was not easily accessible, nor to be persuaded to come to Erech, even though the Sun-god, Shamash, himself 'opened his lips and spoke to him from heaven,' making great promises on Izdubar's behalf:-- 'They shall clothe thee in royal robes, they shall make thee great; and Izdubar shall become thy friend, and he shall place thee in a luxurious seat at his left hand; the kings of the earth shall kiss thy feet; he shall enrich thee and make the men of Erech keep silence before thee.' The hermit was proof against ambition and refused to leave his wilderness. Then a follower of Izdubar,, the huntsman, was sent to bring him; but he returned alone and reported that, when he had approached the seer's cave, he had been seized with fear and had not entered it, but had crawled back, climbing the steep bank on his hands and feet. 1. At last Izdubar bethought him to send out Ishtar's handmaidens, ('Grace'), bending her face towards him, he listened and was attentive. And she said to him: 'Famous art thou, Eabani, even like a god; why then associate with the wild things of the desert? Thy place is in the midst of Erech, the great city, in the temple, the seat of Anu and Ishtar, in the palace of Izdubar, the man of might, who towers amidst the leaders as a bull.' 'She spoke to him, and before her words the wisdom of his heart fled and vanished.' He answered: 'I will go to Erech, to the temple, the seat of Anu and Ishtar, to the palace of Izdubar, the man of might, who towers amidst the leaders as a bull. I will meet him and see his might. But I shall bring to Erech a lion--let Izdubar destroy him if he can. He is bred in the wilderness and of great strength.' So Zaidu and the two women went back to Erech, and Eabani went with them, leading his lion. The chiefs of the city received him with great honors and gave a splendid entertainment in sign of rejoicing. 2. It is evidently on this occasion that Izdubar conquers the seer's esteem by fighting and killing the lion, after which the hero and the sage enter into a solemn covenant of friendship. But the third tablet, which contains this part of the story, is so much mutilated as to leave much of the substance to conjecture, while all the details, and the interpretation of the dream which is probably given, are lost. The same is unfortunately the case with the fourth and fifth tablets, from which we can only gather that Izdubar and Eabani, who have become inseparable, start on an expedition against the Elamite tyrant,, who holds his court in a gloomy forest of cedars and cypresses, enter his palace, fall upon him unawares and kill him, leaving his body to be torn and devoured by the birds of prey, after which exploit Izdubar, as his friend had predicted to him, is proclaimed king in Erech. The sixth tablet is far better preserved, and gives us one of the most interesting incidents almost complete. 3. After Izdubar's victory, his glory and power were great, and the goddess Ishtar looked on him with favor and wished for his love. 'Izdubar,' she said, 'be my husband and I will be thy wife: pledge thy troth to me. Thou shalt drive a chariot of gold and precious stones, thy days shall be marked with conquests; kings, princes and lords shall be subject to thee and kiss thy feet; they shall bring thee tribute from mountain and valley, thy herds and flocks shall multiply doubly, thy mules shall be fleet, and thy oxen strong under the yoke. Thou shalt have no rival.' But Izdubar, in his pride, rejected the love of the goddess; he insulted her and taunted her with having loved Dumuzi and others before him. Great was the wrath of Ishtar; she ascended to heaven and stood before her father Anu: 'My father, Izdubar has insulted me. Izdubar scorns my beauty and spurns my love.' She demanded satisfaction, and Anu, at her request, created a monstrous bull, which he sent against the city of Erech. But Izdubar and his friend went out to fight the bull, and killed him. Eabani took hold of his tail and horns, and Izdubar gave him his deathblow. They drew the heart out of his body and offered it to Shamash. Then Ishtar ascended the wall of the city, and standing there cursed Izdubar. She gathered her handmaidens around her and they raised loud lamentations over the death of the divine bull. But Izdubar called together his people and bade them lift up the body and carry it to the altar of Shamash and lay it before the god. Then they washed their hands in the Euphrates and returned to the city, where they made a feast of rejoicing and revelled deep into the night, while in the streets a proclamation to the people of Erech was called out, which began with the triumphant words: 'Who is skilled among leaders? Who is great among men? Izdubar is skilled among leaders; Izdubar is great among men.' 4. But the vengeance of the offended goddess was not to be so easily defeated. It now fell on the hero in a more direct and personal way. Ishtar's mother, the goddess Anatu, smote Eabani with sudden death and Izdubar with a dire disease, a sort of leprosy, it would appear. Mourning for his friend, deprived of strength and tortured with intolerable pains, he saw visions and dreams which oppressed and terrified him, and there was now no wise, familiar voice to soothe and counsel him. At length he decided to consult his ancestor, Hasisadra, who dwelt far away, 'at the mouth of the rivers,' and was immortal, and to ask of him how he might find healing and strength. He started on his way alone and came to a strange country, where he met gigantic, monstrous beings, half men, half scorpions: their feet were below the earth, while their heads touched the gates of heaven; they were the warders of the sun and kept their watch over its rising and setting. They said one to another: 'Who is this that comes to us with the mark of the divine wrath on his body?' Izdubar made his person and errand known to them; then they gave him directions how to reach the land of the blessed at the mouth of the rivers, but warned him that the way was long and full of hardships.""","""Epic of Izdubar and Eabani""","2090","""The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the oldest known literary works in existence, with its most famous version discovered on ancient Mesopotamian tablets. Within this epic, the friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu is a central theme that resonates throughout the narrative. Enkidu's character is often associated with themes of nature, civilization, and the human experience. His name in the original Sumerian text is Eabani, and his role in the epic provides a poignant exploration of the human condition, companionship, and mortality.  Eabani serves as a foil to Gilgamesh, contrasting the king's arrogance and tyranny with Eabani's connection to the natural world. Eabani is introduced as a wild man, living harmoniously with the animals in the steppe. His close bond with nature highlights his purity and innocence, qualities that stand in stark contrast to Gilgamesh's oppressive rule over the city of Uruk. When Eabani is brought to Uruk to challenge Gilgamesh, their initial confrontation quickly transforms into a deep and profound friendship.  The friendship between Gilgamesh and Eabani is central to the epic's exploration of human relationships and the quest for meaning in a world marked by mortality. Their bond transcends their differences, bridging the gap between civilization and the wild. Through their shared adventures and trials, Gilgamesh learns humility, compassion, and the value of companionship. Eabani, in turn, experiences the joys and sorrows of human connection, grappling with the complexities of mortality and the inevitability of death.  One of the most poignant moments in the Epic of Gilgamesh is Eabani's death, which serves as a powerful commentary on the fragility of life and the inevitability of mortality. After a fierce battle with the Bull of Heaven, Eabani succumbs to his wounds, leaving Gilgamesh grief-stricken and alone. Eabani's death marks a turning point in the narrative, pushing Gilgamesh to confront his own mortality and embark on a quest for immortality.  Eabani's death also underscores the ephemeral nature of human existence and the importance of cherishing the bonds we form in life. Through his sacrifice, Eabani imparts a profound lesson to Gilgamesh about the transience of life and the significance of the connections we forge with others. His passing serves as a catalyst for Gilgamesh's own journey of self-discovery, leading him to seek answers about the nature of life, death, and the divine.  The character of Eabani embodies humanity's deep-rooted connection to the natural world and the eternal cycle of life and death. His portrayal as a wild man resonates with themes of primal instinct, innocence, and untamed spirit. Eabani's character arc in the Epic of Gilgamesh reflects a broader exploration of human nature, society, and the timeless struggle to find meaning in a world marked by impermanence.  In addition to his symbolic role, Eabani's character also serves as a narrative device to drive the epic's plot forward. His arrival in Uruk sets in motion a series of events that propel Gilgamesh on his quest for immortality. Eabani's influence on Gilgamesh's character development is profound, shaping the king's understanding of friendship, loss, and the limits of human power.  The friendship between Gilgamesh and Eabani transcends the boundaries of time and culture, resonating with audiences across centuries. Their bond stands as a testament to the enduring power of human connection and the profound impact that companionship can have on our lives. Through their journey together, Gilgamesh and Eabani navigate the complexities of friendship, love, and loss, offering readers a timeless reflection on the human experience.  In conclusion, the character of Eabani in the Epic of Gilgamesh plays a pivotal role in shaping the narrative's exploration of human relationships, mortality, and the quest for meaning. Through his bond with Gilgamesh, Eabani embodies themes of nature, civilization, and the eternal struggle to find one's place in the world. His character's depth and complexity serve as a timeless reflection on the human condition, reminding readers of the enduring power of friendship, love, and the connections that define us as individuals.""","875"
"Steiner Rudolf","""The forces which are active within my body are the same as those which exist outside. I am, therefore, really identical with the objects; not, however, I in so far as I am subject of perception, but I in so far as I am a part within the universal cosmic process. The percept of the tree belongs to the same whole as my Self. The universal cosmic process produces alike, here the percept of the tree, and there the percept of my Self. Were I a world-creator instead of a world-knower, subject and originate in one act. For they condition one another reciprocally. As world-knower I can discover the common element in both, so far as they are complementary aspects of the world, only through thought which by means of concepts relates the one to the other. The most difficult to drive from the field are the so-called physiological proofs of the subjectivity of our percepts. When I exert pressure on the skin of my body, I experience it as a pressure sensation. This same pressure can be sensed as light by the eye, as sound by the ear. I experience an electrical shock by the eye as light, by the ear as sound, by the nerves of the skin as touch, and by the nose as a smell of phosphorus. What follows from these facts? Only this: I experience an electrical shock, or, as the case may be, a pressure followed by a light, or a sound, or, it may be, a certain smell, etc. If there were no eye present, then no light quality would accompany the perception of the mechanical vibrations in my environment; without the presence of the ear, no sound, etc. But what right have we to say that in the absence of sense-organs the whole process would not exist at all? All those who, from the fact that an electrical process causes a sensation of light in the eye, conclude that what we sense as light is only a mechanical process of motion, forget that they are only arguing from one percept to another, and not at all to something altogether transcending percepts. Just as we can say that the eye perceives a mechanical process of motion in its surroundings as light, so we can affirm that every change in an object, determined by natural law, is perceived by us as a process of motion. If I draw twelve pictures of a horse on the circumference of a rotating disc, reproducing exactly the positions which the horse's body successively assumes in movement, I can, by rotating the disc, produce the illusion of movement. I need only look through an opening in such a way that, at regular intervals, I perceive the successive positions of the horse. I perceive, not separate pictures of twelve horses, but one picture of a single galloping horse. The above-mentioned physiological facts cannot, therefore, throw any light on the relation of percept to idea. Hence, we must seek a relation some other way. The moment a percept appears in my field of consciousness, thought, too, becomes active in me. A member of my thought-system, a definite intuition, a concept, connects itself with the percept. When, next, the percept disappears from my field of vision, what remains? The intuition, with the reference to the particular percept which it acquired in the moment of perception. The degree of vividness with which I can subsequently recall this reference depends on the manner in which my mental and bodily organism is working. An idea is nothing but an intuition related to a particular percept; it is a concept which was once connected with a certain percept, and which retains this reference to the percept. My concept of a lion is not constructed out of my percepts of a lion; but my idea of a lion is formed under the guidance of the percepts. I can teach someone to form the concept of a lion without his ever having seen a lion, but I can never give him a living idea of it without the help of his own perception. An idea is therefore nothing but an individualised concept. And now we can see how real objects can be represented to us by ideas. The full reality of a thing is present to us in the moment of observation through the combination of concept and percept. The concept acquires by means of the percept an individualised form, a relation to this particular percept. In this individualised form which carries with it, as an essential feature, the reference to the percept, it continues to exist in us and constitutes the idea of the thing in question. If we come across a second thing with which the same concept connects itself, we recognise the second as being of the same kind as the first; if we come across the same thing twice, we find in our conceptual system, not merely a corresponding concept, but the individualised concept with its characteristic relation to this same object, and thus we recognise the object again. The idea, then, stands between the percept and the concept. It is the determinate concept which points to the percept. The sum of my ideas may be called my experience. The man who has the greater number of individualised concepts will be the man of richer experience. A man who lacks all power of intuition is not capable of acquiring experience. The objects simply disappear again from the field of his consciousness, because he lacks the concepts which he ought to bring into relation with them. On the other hand, a man whose faculty of thought is well developed, but whose perception functions badly owing to his clumsy sense-organs, will be no better able to gain experience. He can, it is true, by one means and another acquire concepts; but the living reference to particular objects is lacking to his intuitions. The unthinking traveller and the student absorbed in abstract conceptual systems are alike incapable of acquiring a rich experience. Reality presents itself to us as the union of percept and concept; and the subjective representation of this reality presents itself to us as idea. If our personality expressed itself only in cognition, the totality of all that is objective would be contained in percept, concept and idea. However, we are not satisfied merely to refer percepts, by means of thinking, to concepts, but we relate them also to our private subjectivity, our individual Ego. The expression of this relation to us as individuals is feeling, which manifests itself as pleasure and pain. Thinking and feeling correspond to the two-fold nature of our being to which reference has already been made. By means of thought we take an active part in the universal cosmic process. By means of feeling we withdraw ourselves into the narrow precincts of our own being. Thought links us to the world; feeling leads us back into ourselves and thus makes us individuals. Were we merely thinking and perceiving beings, our whole life would flow along in monotonous indifference. Could we only know ourselves as Selves, we should be totally indifferent to ourselves. It is only because with self-knowledge we experience self-feeling, and with the perception of objects pleasure and pain, that we live as individuals whose existence is not exhausted by the conceptual relations in which they stand to the rest of the world, but who have a special value in themselves. One might be tempted to regard the life of feeling as something more richly saturated with reality than the apprehension of the world by thought. But the reply to this is that the life of feeling, after all, has this richer meaning only for my individual self. For the universe as a whole my feelings can be of value only if, as percepts of myself, they enter into connection with a concept and in this roundabout way become links in the cosmos. Our life is a continual oscillation between our share in the universal world-process and our own individual existence. The farther we ascend into the universal nature of thought where the individual, at last, interests us only as an example, an instance, of the concept, the more the character of something individual, of the quite determinate, unique personality, becomes lost in us. The farther we descend into the depths of our own private life and allow the vibrations of our feelings to accompany all our experiences of the outer world, the more we cut ourselves off from the universal life. True individuality belongs to him whose feelings reach up to the farthest possible extent into the region of the ideal. There are men in whom even the most general ideas still bear that peculiar personal tinge which shows unmistakably their connection with their author. There are others whose concepts come before us as devoid of any trace of individual colouring as if they had not been produced by a being of flesh and blood at all. Even ideas give to our conceptual life an individual stamp. Each one of us has his special standpoint from which he looks out on the world. His concepts link themselves to his percepts. He has his own special way of forming general concepts. This special character results for each of us from his special standpoint in the world, from the way in which the range of his percepts is dependent on the place in the whole where he exists. The conditions of individuality here indicated, we call the milieu. This special character of our experience must be distinguished from another which depends on our peculiar organisation. Each of us, as we know, is organised as a unique, fully determined individual. Each of us combines special feelings, and these in the most varying degrees of intensity, with his percepts. This is just the individual element in the personality of each of us. It is what remains over when we have allowed fully for all the determining factors in our milieu. A life of feeling, wholly devoid of thought, would gradually lose all connection with the world. But man is meant to be a whole, and knowledge of objects will go hand-in-hand for him with the development and education of the feeling-side of his nature.""","""Perception, Concepts, and Individuality Relation""","1983","""Perception, Concepts, and Individuality: Exploring the Intricate Relationship  Perception, concepts, and individuality are intertwined components that shape how we interact with the world around us, influencing our understanding of reality, forming the basis of our beliefs, and defining our unique identity. This intricate relationship plays a crucial role in shaping our thoughts, behaviors, and ultimately, our place in society. By delving into the complexities of perception, concepts, and individuality, we can gain a deeper understanding of how these elements interact and influence one another.  Perception serves as the lens through which we interpret the world. It involves the process of organizing and interpreting sensory information to make sense of the environment around us. Our perception is not a direct reflection of reality but rather a constructed representation influenced by our past experiences, beliefs, and cognitive biases. This subjective nature of perception highlights the individual aspect of how we perceive the world, leading to variations in interpretation even within the same shared reality.  Concepts, on the other hand, are mental constructs that help us categorize and make sense of information. They are the building blocks of our cognition, allowing us to group similar objects, ideas, or experiences under a single mental representation. Concepts provide us with a framework for understanding the world, enabling us to navigate complex environments by simplifying information into manageable units. However, concepts are not static entities; they evolve and adapt based on new information and experiences, reshaping our understanding of the world.  The relationship between perception and concepts is intricate and multifaceted. Our perception influences the formation and interpretation of concepts, as our experiences and beliefs shape how we categorize and make sense of the world. At the same time, concepts influence our perception by providing a filter through which we interpret sensory information. This dynamic interplay between perception and concepts highlights the symbiotic nature of these cognitive processes, demonstrating how they work in tandem to construct our reality.  Individuality adds another layer of complexity to the relationship between perception and concepts. Our unique experiences, beliefs, values, and personality traits contribute to our individual way of perceiving and conceptualizing the world. This individual lens influences not only how we interpret information but also how we construct and apply concepts in our daily lives. Our individuality shapes the nuances of our perception and the depth of our conceptual frameworks, making each person's cognitive landscape a personalized and distinct terrain.  The integration of perception, concepts, and individuality is essential in understanding human behavior, decision-making, and social interactions. Our perception of the world informs the concepts we use to make sense of it, and both are filtered through the lens of our individuality, giving rise to a diverse array of perspectives and interpretations. This diversity enriches our collective understanding of the world, fostering creativity, innovation, and empathy through the exchange of ideas and beliefs.  In the realm of psychology, the study of perception, concepts, and individuality offers valuable insights into cognition, identity formation, and human development. Research in this area explores how individuals perceive and process information, how concepts are acquired and used, and how individual differences in perception and conceptualization contribute to personality traits and behavior patterns. By unraveling the complexities of perception, concepts, and individuality, psychologists can shed light on the underlying mechanisms that drive human cognition and shape our understanding of the self and others.  Philosophically, the relationship between perception, concepts, and individuality raises profound questions about the nature of reality, knowledge, and subjective experience. Philosophers have debated the extent to which perception shapes our understanding of reality, the universality of concepts across cultures, and the role of individuality in shaping philosophical perspectives. These discussions delve into the core of human existence, challenging traditional notions of truth, objectivity, and identity.  In everyday life, the interplay of perception, concepts, and individuality influences our interactions with the world and those around us. It dictates how we form opinions, make decisions, and relate to others, shaping our personal and professional relationships, influencing our beliefs and values, and guiding our actions and choices. Being aware of the complex dynamics of perception, concepts, and individuality can enhance our self-awareness, empathy, and adaptability, allowing us to navigate the complexities of the modern world with a deeper understanding of ourselves and others.  In conclusion, perception, concepts, and individuality are intricately interconnected elements that shape our cognition, identity, and interactions with the world. Understanding the dynamic relationship between these components is essential for comprehending human behavior, cognitive processes, and societal dynamics. By exploring the nuances of perception, concepts, and individuality, we can gain valuable insights into the complexities of the human mind and the diversity of human experience, paving the way for a more profound appreciation of the multifaceted nature of human existence.""","959"
"Anderson Benjamin M  Benjamin McAlester ","""See supra, chap. II. But as later indicated (infra, chap. XIII), the apparent simplicity of his analysis simply covers up, and does not eliminate, the complexity of the situation. Op. cit., pp. 1-2. See supra, chap. II. Economics of Distribution, p. 1. VII 'S OF And all attempts to explain value in terms of these abstract factors must become similarly entangled. The Austrians themselves have pointed out that the explanation of value from the standpoint of individual costs involves a circle, that costs resolve themselves into value-complexes, and that the cost theorists are really explaining value by value. I have shown that the same is true of the Austrian attempt to reduce values to terms of individual utilities. It is also true of Hobson's attempt to combine the two explanations, as shown, and the same could be shown of at least the earlier writings of Professor Marshall. There is another attempt to work out the explanation of value, still in terms of sacrifices in production and satisfactions in consumption, but no longer from the same standpoint, which deserves special attention here. Professor Clark, in the Yale Review for 892, in the article above referred to, 'The Ultimate Standard of Value' (since reproduced as chapter XXIV of the Distribution of Wealth), has attempted so to add up individual units of cost and individual units of utility, as to get absolute social units of utility and cost either of which might serve as the ultimate standard of value. It will be remembered that I have already quoted from this article with reference to the quantitative nature of value, and that Professor Clark stands as the leading exponent of the conception that value is a social fact, 'is social and subjective,' the value put on goods by the social organism. In this article, he is seeking the unit of social value, the measure of the importance of a good to society. Either the unit of social utility or the unit of social detriment would serve, but it happens, he holds, that the unit of detriment is the more available for purposes of measurement, and so the final unit of value is the sacrifice entailed by a quantity of distinctively social will not suffer the loss of anything more important than the product of the last hour's labor, for he will forego that, and re-create the good with the higher utility. The utility of the last hour's product and the pain of the last hour's labor are equal. Either is his unit of value. Of society regarded as a unit the same is true. Take away the articles that the society gains by the labor of a morning hour,--the necessary food, clothing and shelter that it absolutely must have,--and it will divert to making good the loss the work performed at the approach of evening, which would otherwise have produced the final luxuries on its list of goods. (It might be questioned parenthetically here whether all are fed before any begin to enjoy luxuries, or, if not, just what is considered the 'socially necessary' amount of food, and whom does social necessity require that we feed before we devote an hour to making luxuries?) Professor Clark finds the final hour of social labor-pain to be a compound, the sum of the final hour's dissatisfactions of all the laborers. This sum is the ultimate standard of value. It is in equilibrium with the sum of the utilities of the final hour's products to all the laborers considered as consumers. This is illustrated by a diagram on page 71. But the problem still remains as to the value of particular goods. Granted that the sum of the satisfactions got from the total amount--a vast amount--of the final hour's product is equal to the sum of the pains incurred in producing this giant composite, and granted that the pain incurred by each man in making his part of the composite is equal to the satisfaction gained by him in consuming his part of the composite--not the same part!--the problem still remains as to the connection of the marginal utility and the value of the particular goods that make up the composite, with social labor. Professor Clark concedes at once that there is no necessary connection between the utility of the good to him who enjoys it, and the pain of making it to him who makes it. What connection is there than, between the value of the good and social labour? It is at this point, I venture to suggest, that Professor Clark's argument fails. I shall not follow his argument in detail, but shall quote a couple of paragraphs which seem to exhibit the surely this is our old circle again. If differences in wealth, which is the embodiment of value, are to modify the working of the 'pervasive element' of 'personal sacrifice' (p. 63), it is difficult to see how that pervasive element can in any way be an ultimate explanation or measure of value. The rich worker stops producing early, while the sacrifice entailed is still small; but his product sells as well as if it were costly. If we say that the prices of things correspond with the amount and efficiency of the labor that creates them, we say what is equivalent to the above proposition. The efficiency that figures in the case is power and willingness to produce a certain effect. The willingness is as essential as the power. Moreover, the effect that gauges the efficiency of a worker is the value of what he creates; and this value is measured by the formula that we have attained. But surely the circle is very clear here: the the good depends on the efficiency of the labor that produces it; and the efficiency of the labor depends on the the good produced. Our 'pervasive element' is complicated, as a determinant of social value, with several factors, among them the value of the wealth of the different producers, and the efficiency, which can be defined only in terms of value product, of the workers. Value is an ultimate in the explanation of value, and the effort to make individual costs and utilities an ultimate explanation of value has failed--as it must needs fail--even in the hands of Professor Clark. The validity of this criticism, assuming it valid, in no way invalidates Professor Clark's contention that value is, after all, the work of the social organism, and that the value of a good, at a given time, measures its importance to the social organism at that time. The difficulty with the analysis just criticized is that it has not been an analysis of an organic process, but rather, a mathematical study of sums. The individuals have been treated, not as interacting in their mental processes, but as isolated atoms, each of whom has a definite individual quantum of pain or pleasure, and the social unit of pain or pleasure has been treated as simply a sum of these. But it is characteristic of an organism that the simple rules of arithmetic do not hold precisely in its activity. The whole is more than the sum of its parts, and something different from that sum. Professor Clark elsewhere says:-- But the owner is a part of the social body, and is the organic whole indifferent to his suffering? If so, society is an imperfect and nerveless organism.""","""Value Theory and Economic Analysis""","1447","""Value theory is a fundamental concept in economics that seeks to understand the worth or value of goods and services in a market economy. At its core, value theory delves into the intricacies of how individuals and societies assign value to different items, whether tangible goods like cars and houses or intangible services like education and healthcare. This theory plays a crucial role in economic analysis, as it helps economists and policymakers make decisions about production, consumption, and distribution of resources. In this discussion, we will explore the key principles of value theory and its significance in economic analysis.  One of the central ideas in value theory is that value is subjective. This means that the value of a good or service is not inherent in the item itself but is determined by how much individuals are willing to pay for it. For example, a rare painting may be valued highly by art collectors but may have little value to someone who is not interested in art. This subjective theory of value contrasts with earlier theories, such as the labor theory of value, which posited that the value of a good was determined by the labor required to produce it.  Value theory is closely linked to the concept of utility, which refers to the level of satisfaction or pleasure that individuals derive from consuming a good or service. Economists often use the term """"utils"""" to measure utility, although utility is not directly quantifiable. Consumers make decisions about what to buy based on their preferences, tastes, and budget constraints, all of which influence the perceived value of different goods and services.  In economic analysis, value theory is essential for understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics. By examining how individuals assign value to different items, economists can predict trends in consumption patterns, pricing strategies, and overall market equilibrium. For instance, when the demand for a particular product increases, its value in the eyes of consumers also tends to rise, leading to higher prices and potentially greater profits for producers.  Additionally, value theory plays a significant role in production decisions. Firms must consider the value of inputs such as labor, capital, and raw materials when determining the most cost-effective way to produce goods and services. Understanding the value of these inputs relative to the final output helps businesses optimize their production processes and maximize profits.  Another crucial aspect of value theory is the distinction between use value and exchange value. Use value refers to the inherent utility or usefulness of a good or service, such as a car providing transportation or a smartphone enabling communication. Exchange value, on the other hand, refers to the value of a good or service in terms of its ability to be exchanged for other goods or money in the market. The interplay between these two types of value shapes market interactions and price formation.  In modern economics, the concept of value extends beyond individual preferences to include social and environmental considerations. The idea of sustainable value, for example, emphasizes the long-term impact of economic activities on society and the environment. Businesses that create sustainable value not only generate profits but also contribute to the well-being of communities and ecosystems.  Value theory also intersects with ethical considerations, as the distribution of value across society raises questions of fairness and justice. Issues such as income inequality, access to essential services, and environmental degradation are all influenced by how value is created, distributed, and recognized in economic systems. Economists and policymakers must grapple with these ethical dilemmas when formulating policies to address social challenges.  In conclusion, value theory is a foundational concept in economics that underpins our understanding of how goods and services are valued in a market economy. By recognizing the subjective nature of value, economists can analyze consumer behavior, production decisions, and market outcomes more effectively. The concepts of utility, use value, exchange value, and sustainable value all contribute to a comprehensive understanding of value theory and its implications for economic analysis and policy-making. By integrating these principles into economic models and decision-making processes, we can strive to create a more equitable and sustainable economic system for the benefit of society as a whole.""","790"
"Pozzi Escot M Emm  Marius Emmanuel  1880 ","""These de doctorat, Bordeaux, 902. Hemialbumose, from which peptones are formed, is itself a dangerous toxin. It is generally believed that the toxic action of the peptones and of the products of digestion of the albuminoids is due not to the peptone itself, but to the more advanced products of digestion, alkaloidal products unquestionably closely allied to the ptomaines. Nevertheless, the true peptones behave just like true poisons, when they are introduced hypodermically into the blood.: Muhlheim, Arch. de physiol., 880. Brieger has made us acquainted with a non-proteid substance, under the name of 'peptotoxin,' which is met with at the beginning of the putrefaction of albuminoids. This toxin, which is not a protein, is nothing else but a ptomaine. It is not altered by heat, and possesses a very high toxicity. Brieger claims that it is a hydroxylized derivative of an aromatic amide.: Berichte d. D. chem. Gesellsch., XIX, p. 120; and Verhandl. d. Congress f. innere Med., II, p. 77. Besides these facts, experiment has shown that the leucocytes, or white corpuscles, the defensive role of which we have noted in phagocytosis, owe their properties to the ferments which they secrete, and particularly to some of the digestive ferments. These white corpuscles are very rich in ferments of all kinds. Rossbach found in them amylase; Achalme found lipase, casease, and trypsin; and the study of immunity has brought to light a series of other ferments, the alexins or cytases (microcytase and macrocytase), which have an exceedingly important role to play. It may easily be conceived that under certain circumstances a part or the whole of these ferments can pass into the blood of the fluids of the body, when they give rise to serious disturbances in certain cases, or confer immunity in others. It is thus that, according to Gautier, the rise of temperature which characterizes fever is a consequence of the abnormal transudation of these normal ferments into the blood, and their transmission by the general circulation to the nervous centers. However, it is not only in the leucocytes that we meet with these toxic digestive ferments; it appears quite probable, and has even been partially demonstrated, that they occur in a large number of other cellular elements. It is not necessary here to dwell upon the formation of the antibodies of this group of active substances. The animal toxins are animal diastases, and we have seen in the preceding paragraph that these substances yield specific antibodies with great facility. For the rest, we will dwell more fully on these antibodies of the animal toxins in another volume of this collection, specially devoted to the study of these substances, and entitled 'Les Serums Immunisants,' to which we refer the reader who is desirous of obtaining more complete details than he can obtain in the present volume. =Alimentary Intoxications.=--What we have already stated permits us to understand the phenomena of indigestion and botulism. The toxic substances form within the digestive tract when the nervous conditions modify the composition of the gastric juice, and arrest the flow of hydrochloric acid, the presence of which normally checks the development of the microbial flora, so rich within the stomach. The result is the production, within the organism, of all kinds of dangerous toxins. The same thing happens when the liver does not functionate normally, and this, affords us a knowledge of the mechanism by which foods that are most wholesome may become toxic by reason of poor digestion or poor assimilation. The absorption of spoiled viands may, a fortiori, produce serious results. The alteration may be due not only to a bacterial infection, as in tainted meat, but it has also been proved that the flesh of an animal that has died of terror or madness may be very dangerous as a food, even after cooking, because, although there are toxins which are destroyed by a sufficient heat, there are ptomaines and certain toxins that resist destruction under these conditions. and: Examens des aliments suspects, Masson, publisher. The use of preserved but spoiled beef, preserved ham or birds, sausages frequently, and pieces of pork tainted by sausage poison, gives rise to a succession of toxic symptoms the principal ones of which are dryness, constriction of the pharynx, bilious vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea with pulmonary edema, etc. Fish and eggs are foods quite frequently capable of developing serious results; the same is the case with molluscs, mussels, oysters, lobsters, and snails. Lastly, moldy bread, spoiled cheese, putrid water, and spoiled vegetables themselves, are proper agents for determining attacks of botulic poisoning. We have seen, at the beginning of this volume, that putrid meats contain ptomaines, which are among the most toxic alkaloidal bases. We have shown that Brieger has isolated from them neuridine, putrescine, muscarine, and guanidine; that Nencki has isolated hydrocollidine; and that Gautier and Etard have obtained from them parvoline--only to mention a few of them. Lastly, there may develop within the gastrointestinal tract dangerous putrefactions, the products of which may enter the veins and arteries from the be distributed throughout the organism. Although such poisonings occur, they do not immediately follow the ingestion of the spoiled or toxic foods, but they are always preceded by a period of incubation varying from several hours to several days. These alimentary poisonings are recognized by a great physical depression, accompanied by vomiting and paralysis of the lower extremities, sweats, and diarrheas. In some cases there occur cutaneous eruptions; and when death happens, this occurs only several days later, and generally without being preceded by any great pain. =Urinary Toxins.=--As we have already remarked several times, it is by the renal way that the organism voids its principal waste products. We have seen also that it is by the kidneys that the toxins are eliminated in all pathological conditions. As a general rule, the urines are always more or less toxic. This toxicity of the urines must be attributed in the first place to the crystallizable organic they contain; secondly, to the non-crystallizable extractive matters not so well known; and lastly, to the saline substances, among which the potassium salts are the most active. We find these mineral salts particularly abundant under normal conditions in the urines of the herbivora. According to Bouchard,.8 Gm. of potassium chloride are sufficient to prove fatal to 000 Gm. of living organism; a man excretes on the average. Gm. of this salt, and a rabbit excretes about double this quantity, weight for weight.: Arch. Ital. de biolog., 891.: These de Doctorat en Medecine, Paris, 878. A very large number of hypotheses have been advanced regarding the toxicity of the urines. Wilson considers the urea as being responsible for it; Stadthagen believes it to be due to the potassium salts, etc. Bouchard was the first to recognize that the toxicity of the urines is due to a number of causes. We will not dwell further on these active principles which, in the last analysis, are no other than those that form in the various portions of the organism, and which are eliminated by the urine.: Zeitschr. f. Klin. Med., XV.: Lecons sur les Autointoxications. It is self-evident, and it has already been shown, that the toxicity of the urines varies greatly according to the malady, in consequence of the elimination of toxins by the urines. According to Bouchard, in infectious maladies the urines are twelve times more highly charged with toxins than is blood serum. Moreover, the toxicity of the urines is considerably augmented the moment there is the least febrile condition, no matter what the cause is. Regarding this point see the excellent work by A.: Poisons de l'Organism. Masson, publ. Even in the normal condition, the urinary toxicity varies greatly; and this is easily conceived since the physiological phenomena that control this secretion undergo incessant rise and fall. Thus, for example, the urines eliminated during sleep are less active than those produced during waking, because during sleep the elimination of cellular poisons is at a minimum. Exercise, walking, physical and intellectual labor, exert their portion of influence on these oscillations of toxicity; and this variation of toxicity is due not to any one variation in the mineral extractive matters, but rather more or less to the organic toxic products. We will not dwell further on this subject, but will simply refer to the work by Charrin, already mentioned, for all supplementary details. =Autointoxications.=--The cells of the organism having, as a whole, a life very much like that of the microbes, it is quite natural that among the excreted products of the living tissues there should be found the same substances formed as a result of the anaerobic fermentation of albuminoids. Experiment has demonstrated that this is so, and Armand Gautier has irrefutably proven the existence of these principles. Bouchard was the first to demonstrate the toxic nature of muscle extract, and Roger established the fact that the toxicity of this extract is due to ferment-toxins; it has since been recognized that after death these toxins accumulate in the muscles.

However, this intricate machine is not impervious to harm, especially when it comes to toxins. Toxins can enter the body through various avenues, including the food we consume and the liquids we drink. In this discussion, we will delve into the realms of alimentary and urinary toxins, exploring the sources, effects, and ways to mitigate their impact on our health.  Alimentary toxins refer to substances that are ingested through the digestive system. These toxins can come from a variety of sources, including contaminated food, pesticides, additives, and even naturally occurring compounds in certain foods. While the body has mechanisms in place to metabolize and eliminate toxins, some substances can overwhelm these defenses, leading to adverse effects on health.  One of the most common sources of alimentary toxins is contaminated food. Improper handling, storage, or cooking of food can lead to the growth of harmful bacteria such as Salmonella, E. coli, or Listeria. These bacteria can cause foodborne illnesses, resulting in symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and in severe cases, organ damage or even death. To minimize the risk of foodborne toxins, it is essential to follow proper food safety practices, such as washing hands and surfaces, cooking food to safe temperatures, and avoiding cross-contamination.  Pesticides are another significant source of alimentary toxins. While pesticides help protect crops from pests, they can also pose a risk to human health when ingested through contaminated produce. Prolonged exposure to pesticides has been linked to various health issues, including cancer, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. To reduce exposure to pesticide residues, opt for organic produce whenever possible, wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, and peel skin when appropriate.  Food additives are substances added to food to improve taste, texture, or shelf life. While many additives are considered safe for consumption, some have been associated with adverse health effects. For example, artificial sweeteners like aspartame have been linked to headaches, dizziness, and even cancer in some studies. To minimize exposure to potentially harmful additives, choose whole, unprocessed foods and read food labels carefully to identify and avoid questionable ingredients.  In addition to external sources of alimentary toxins, certain foods naturally contain compounds that can be toxic in high amounts. For example, some plants produce toxins as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cyanogenic glycosides, found in cassava and stone fruit pits, can release cyanide when metabolized by the body. While these toxins are typically present in small amounts and neutralized during cooking, overconsumption or improper preparation can lead to poisoning. It is crucial to be aware of potential toxins in food and follow proper cooking methods to reduce the risk of poisoning.  Urinary toxins, on the other hand, are substances that are eliminated from the body through the urinary system. The kidneys play a vital role in filtering waste products and toxins from the blood, excreting them as urine. While the body is equipped to handle a certain amount of toxins, prolonged exposure to high levels of urinary toxins can strain the kidneys and lead to kidney damage or dysfunction.  One of the most common urinary toxins is urea, a waste product formed from the breakdown of proteins in the body. Urea is normally excreted in urine through the kidneys, but in certain medical conditions like kidney disease, urea levels can accumulate in the blood, causing symptoms like fatigue, nausea, and confusion. To prevent the buildup of urea and other waste products in the blood, it is essential to maintain kidney health through a balanced diet, adequate hydration, and regular exercise.  Another group of urinary toxins includes heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. These metals can enter the body through contaminated water, food, or air, accumulating in the kidneys and other organs over time. Chronic exposure to heavy metals has been linked to various health problems, including kidney damage, neurological disorders, and cancer. To reduce exposure to heavy metals, it is important to drink clean, filtered water, consume fish low in mercury, and avoid products containing lead or cadmium.  Certain medications and drugs can also be excreted through the urinary system, potentially causing harm if taken in excessive amounts. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and acetaminophen are commonly excreted through the kidneys and can cause kidney damage or failure with prolonged use or high doses. It is crucial to follow the recommended dosage guidelines for medications and consult a healthcare provider before taking any new medications, particularly if you have underlying kidney issues.  To mitigate the impact of alimentary and urinary toxins on health, it is essential to adopt healthy lifestyle practices and dietary habits. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can provide essential nutrients that support the body's detoxification processes and overall well-being. Staying hydrated by drinking an adequate amount of water helps flush out toxins through the urinary system and maintain kidney function.  Regular exercise not only helps improve circulation and metabolism but also supports the body's natural detoxification mechanisms. Sweating during physical activity allows the body to eliminate toxins through the skin, reducing the burden on the liver and kidneys. Additionally, practicing stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing can help lower cortisol levels and support detoxification pathways in the body.  In conclusion, alimentary and urinary toxins pose a significant risk to human health when not properly managed. By being mindful of the sources of toxins in our diet and environment, adopting healthy lifestyle practices, and seeking medical guidance when needed, we can help protect our bodies from the harmful effects of toxins. Through awareness, education, and proactive steps, we can empower ourselves to lead healthier, toxin-free lives.""","1169"
"Taylor A E  Alfred Edward ","""The finite, again, is finite not primarily merely because it has a last term, i.e. because there is something else outside it, but because its last term is arbitrarily determined, i.e. determined by something other than the principles of its internal structure. In other words, the essential defect of the finite is that it is not solely determined by its own structural principle. We can see this even in the simple case of the familiar infinite series of arithmetic and algebra. Such a series as,,. is infinite not merely because you never come to the last term, but because its character is determined from within, solely by the principle according to which each term is derived from the one before it; that the series has no end is a simple consequence of this positive property of self-determination. But suppose I take n terms of this series and no more, where n is a specified number, the resulting series is now finite, not primarily because there are more terms of the same kind outside it, but because the number of terms to be taken is not prescribed by the law of formation of the series, but fixed with reference to some object independent of the principle of the series itself. In other words, only the infinite is in the full sense of the words a completely self-determined whole. The finite is the imperfect, not primarily because there is something outside it, but because its contents are not solely prescribed by the principle of structure which they embody. I, for instance, am a finite being, not principally or merely because there are other men in the world, but because my ideas and purposes are not a fully coherent systematic whole in themselves. The view we have taken of individuality and the distinction between finite and infinite individuality is closely akin to some of the most fundamental ideas in the philosophy of Leibnitz. It was the doctrine of Leibnitz that each of his monads represented the nature of the whole system of existence, i.e. repeated the structure of the whole in its own special structure, from a particular point of view. According to the fulness and clearness of the representation, i.e. the adequacy with which the structure of the monad repeated the structure of the whole system, the monads were classed as higher or lower in the scale of existence. The clearer a monads representation of the whole within itself, the greater the monads activity; the more confused the representation, the greater its passivity. It followed that, inasmuch as no created monad fully exhibits the systematic structure of the whole of Reality within itself, every one contains some element of passivity, and that to be passive primarily means not to be affected by extraneous influences, but to contain internal confusion. Thus the activity of Leibnitz exactly corresponds to what we have called individuality, and his passivity to that want of complete internal systematisation which we have found inseparable from finite existence. The immense significance of this definition of activity and passivity in terms of internal systematisation will be more apparent when we come, in our concluding book, to discuss the meaning of human freedom, and its connection with determination and causality. For the present it is enough to note that our own doctrine is substantially that of Leibnitz freed from the inconsistency which is introduced into it by the monadistic assumption of the complete independence of the various finite individuals. It is, of course, impossible to unite, as Leibnitz tried to do, the two thoughts. Either there is ultimately only one independent individual, the infinite individual whole, or there is no meaning in speaking of higher and lower degrees of individuality. Leibnitzs inconsistency on this point seems due entirely to his desire to maintain the absolute individuality of the particular human soul, a desire which is explained, partly at least, by his anxiety not to come into collision, as Spinoza and others had done, with the official theology of the period.. The definition of infinite and finite individuality completes the general outline of our conception of Reality as a whole, and its relation to its constituent elements. Recapitulating that doctrine, we may now say that the real is a single all-embracing whole of experience or psychical matter of fact, determined entirely from within by a principle of internal structure, and therefore completely individual. Because the matter of the system is in all its parts experience, the principle of its structure must be teleological in character. That is, the system must be the embodiment, in a harmonious unity of conscious feeling, of a consistent interest or mental attitude. As such we may call it the realisation indifferently of a purpose or idea, and we may speak of the absolute experience as the completed expression of an absolute knowledge or an absolute will. But if we do so, we must bear in mind that there can be here no question of a thought which works upon and reconstructs into systematic harmony a body of data originally supplied to it in a relatively unintelligible and disconnected form from some foreign source, or of a volition which gradually translates into reality an end or purpose originally present to it as an unrealised idea. The processes of thought and volition can clearly have no place in an experience for which the what and the that are never disjoined; as we shall by and by see more fully, they involve existence in time, and existence in time can belong only to the finite and imperfect. Hence it is best, in the interest of intellectual clarity and candour, to avoid the use of such expressions as knowledge and will in speaking of the absolute experience; at best they are in large part metaphorical, and at worst potent weapons of intellectual dishonesty. The constituents of the system, again, are lesser experience systems of the same general type, in each of which the nature of the whole manifests itself, though to different degrees. They are thus all finite individuals of varying degrees of individuality. The more comprehensive and the more internally unified by an immanent principle of teleological structure such a system, the more fully individual it is, and the more adequately does it reveal the structure of the all-pervading whole. This is the intellectual justification for our instinctive belief that what is for our human experience highest and best is ultimately in the constitution of the universe most completely real. Consult further: F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, chap. 4, Degrees of Truth and Reality; Plato, Republic, vi. 09 ff., with the commentary in R. L. Nettleships Lectures on Platos Republic, or Bosanquets Companion to the Republic. -- Footnote 6: Not the sum of them, because the systematic whole of Reality is not a sum but a single experience. To identify it with the sum of its appearances would be the same error which occurs in Ethics as the identification of the sum of pleasures (a quantitative collection). Footnote 7: The reader will find it instructive to observe how Prof. Sidgwick unconsciously assumes that the distinction between Reality and Appearance means a distinction between two more or less independent worlds or things (Philosophy: its Scope and Relations, Lectures and ), and thus deprives his own criticism of the antithesis of all validity as against a view like our own. Footnote 8: So, again, a velocity which is already infinitesimal may receive an acceleration which is infinitesimal in relation to the velocity itself. The readers own studies will no doubt furnish him with numerous other illustrations of the same kind. Footnote 9: See for illustrations of the impossibility of carrying out a single principle in our actual judgments of particular cases, Mr. Bradleys already quoted article in Mind for July 902. Footnote 0: For a fuller exposition of the conception of infinity here adopted I may refer the reader to the famous essay of Dedekind, Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen, especially pp. 7-0. The English reader will find an account of Dedekinds work, with an acute discussion of its metaphysical significance, in Royce, The World and the Individual, First Series, Supplementary Essay. It does not seem necessary for the purpose of this chapter to specify the points in which I find myself unable to follow Professor Royce in his use of the theory. See infra, chap., 0. Footnote 1: It would not be hard to show that in the end all systematic structure is teleological. For all such structure in the last resort is a form of order, and depends on the possibility of saying here this is first, that is second. And wherever we predicate order we are asserting the embodiment in detail of some dominant purpose. Footnote 2: In fact, it is clear that if we speak of idea or volition in connection with the absolute individual, we cannot mean actual ideas or actual volitions. We must be using the psychological terms improperly in something of the same sense in which we speak of a mans guiding ideas or settled will to denote what clearly, whatever it may be, is not actual ideational or volitional process.

The natural or pre-scientific view of the world regards it as a plurality of things, each possessing qualities, standing in relation to others, and interacting with them.. Hence arise four problems: those of the Unity of the Thing, of Substance and Quality, of Relation, of Causality.. No simple answer can be given to the question, What is one thing?""","""Finite vs Infinite Individuality""","1933","""Finite Versus Infinite Individuality  Individuality, the essence of being uniquely oneself, lies at the core of human existence. It is a concept that captures the diversity and complexity of human beings, shaping our identities, perspectives, and interactions with the world. The exploration of individuality often delves into the contrast between finite and infinite expressions of selfhood. Understanding these two facets provides insight into the richness and depth of human nature.  Finite individuality refers to the tangible, bounded aspects of a person's identity. It encompasses characteristics such as physical appearance, personality traits, experiences, and cultural background that define a person within specific limits. These finite attributes contribute to establishing a person's uniqueness while also highlighting their limitations. For example, one's body type, talents, upbringing, and preferences are finite elements that set individuals apart from each other.  In contrast, infinite individuality transcends the limitations of physical and tangible aspects, delving into the intangible and boundless realms of consciousness and soul. Infinite individuality explores the depths of human potential, creativity, and spiritual essence that extend beyond the confines of time and space. It reflects the interconnectedness of all beings and the universal aspects of human experience that unite us in a shared humanity.  The interplay between finite and infinite individuality shapes the multidimensional nature of human identity. While finite aspects provide a foundation for understanding individual differences and diversity, infinite elements elevate our perception of self to a higher plane of unity and interconnectedness. Embracing both facets allows individuals to navigate the complexities of their existence with a balanced perspective that honors both their unique attributes and their intrinsic connection to the larger fabric of life.  Finite individuality serves as the canvas upon which infinite individuality paints its masterpiece. The unique combination of finite qualities each person possesses acts as a palette of colors from which the infinite self draws inspiration to create a tapestry of existence that is both distinct and interconnected. Just as a painting is comprised of individual brushstrokes that come together to form a coherent whole, human individuality weaves together finite and infinite elements to shape a cohesive and evolving identity.  One of the key challenges in reconciling finite and infinite individuality lies in balancing the egoic need for differentiation with the spiritual desire for unity. The ego seeks to establish a sense of separateness and identity based on external markers of success, recognition, and validation. It often thrives on comparison, competition, and exclusivity, reinforcing the illusion of individuality as a solitary pursuit disconnected from the collective whole.  In contrast, the spiritual dimension of infinite individuality recognizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the oneness that underlies diverse expressions of selfhood. It transcends egoic constructs of identity and embraces a deeper understanding of unity that honors the inherent worth and dignity of every individual. This perspective highlights the shared humanity that unites us all and emphasizes the importance of compassion, empathy, and cooperation in fostering a harmonious society.  To cultivate a harmonious relationship between finite and infinite individuality, individuals can engage in practices that promote self-awareness, introspection, and personal growth. By exploring the depths of their finite qualities and recognizing the interconnectedness of their infinite essence, individuals can develop a more inclusive and holistic understanding of their identity. This process involves embracing both the uniqueness of their individual expression and the universal truths that connect them to the broader human experience.  Mindfulness practices, meditation, journaling, creative expression, and spiritual inquiry are some of the avenues through which individuals can deepen their exploration of finite and infinite individuality. These practices help individuals cultivate self-reflection, emotional intelligence, and a sense of inner balance that transcends external validation or comparison. By nurturing a deeper connection to their authentic self and the interconnected web of life, individuals can enhance their capacity for empathy, compassion, and solidarity with others.  In conclusion, the journey of exploring finite versus infinite individuality is a profound and transformative process that illuminates the multifaceted nature of human identity. By recognizing the interplay between our finite attributes and infinite essence, we can embrace the richness and complexity of our individuality while honoring the unity that binds us to the larger human family. Through self-discovery, introspection, and spiritual inquiry, individuals can cultivate a more integrated and compassionate relationship with themselves and the world around them, fostering a more harmonious and interconnected society.""","869"
"Davey Richard","""This event placed her son, as we have already seen, in a quandary--a State funeral, such as was due to the Kings grandmother, would have enabled Warwick to accuse him of a fresh assumption of regal dignity; a private funeral, on the other hand, might be maliciously construed into disrespect shown to the sovereign. Wherefore Somerset consulted the Council as to what should be done. The reply, as already mentioned, was that a State funeral was not at all necessary, nor even any formal Court mourning, since such observances served rather to pomp than to any edifying, an opinion peculiar to the Council, for in the preceding August a State been organised with all possible pomp. This denial of the honour due to Lady Seymours remains did not, of course, proceed from any idea of economy or Puritanism, but merely from the Councils desire to insult Somerset and his family. It was an opportunity neglected, for if Seymour had insisted upon a State funeral, the events of the following year might have been anticipated, and the accusation of usurping regal honours brought against him at once. Another curious fact in connection with this funeral is that Somerset--a shining light amongst Reformers--wrote to ask Gardiner to offer up Mass for the health of his mothers soul after her method adopted by Warwick was that already employed by Sudeley in his struggle with his elder brother, of spreading calumnies against his rival through the agency of a third person, and ensuring their reaching the Kings ears. After a time these tales began to make their impression on his juvenile Majesty, though Somerset, for his part, was working hard to recover the Kings favour entirely, and consolidate his own position. Rich, the Lord Chancellor, an infamous traitor, gave him his aid and acted as his spy, keeping him informed of every movement made by Warwick and his party. One of Richs letters on this subject, addressed merely To the Duke, was handed by mistake to the Duke of Norfolk, next to Warwick, Somersets bitterest enemy; thus each opponent had some idea of his adversarys plans. Still, so subtle was Warwicks work that there was no movement against Somerset visible enough to justify him in taking open measures; there was nothing for it but to bide his time, and do his best, meanwhile, to ingratiate himself with the King. In public, the rivals appeared the best of friends, and, to maintain this pleasant fiction, Somerset, on 1th October 5/85/81, attended what must have been a painful ceremony to him--the investiture of Warwick with the title of Duke of Northumberland in the Great Hall of Hampton Court. The mortification caused by this evidence of his rivals growing power, a power he could not openly attack, must have been bitter indeed. Side by side with Northumberlands intrigues, the national discontent, of which we have already given instances, and which had been intensified by Northumberlands brief term of office, was a potent factor in the eventual ruin of the Protector: for we may be sure Somersets enemies took good care to father Northumberlands misrule on his rival. It would be useless for our purpose, though easy indeed, to cite further and numerous instances of the universal disorder into which the realm had fallen. Suffice to say that the England of this period strongly resembled France under the Directory. Everything was upside down. The faith of the people had received a staggering blow, from which it would take nearly a hundred years to recover, and then only in a measure, for to this day the masses of the lowest class of the people of England remain in terrible darkness, alike indifferent to influences religious and moral. In the reign of Henry VII, and in the first years of Henry VIII, no hale man or woman dreamt of missing Mass on a Sunday: under Edward VI, Latimer complained that the churches were deserted, and Gardiner describes the lower classes as gradually falling into a state of paganism. This relaxation of religious observance influenced the popular morals, and in every class the domestic habits of the country were most disreputable. So bad was the condition of things, in fact, that Northumberland and his party came to realise that Somersets worst enemy was himself; in other words, that the general discontent and misery arising from his maladministration--or, to be just, in some cases from causes over which he had no control--furnished a more powerful argument against him than the spiteful inventions of his opponents. They must have felt confident that any blow they struck at him would meet with little or no opposition, but rather with encouragement from the people, who had turned the cold shoulder on his appeal at Hampton Court some two years previously. Accordingly, on 6th October 5/85/81, the Duke of Somerset was suddenly re-arrested in the Council Chamber at Hampton Court, and taken to the Tower to await his trial on charges made against him to Northumberland by Sir Thomas Palmer, a brilliant but unprincipled soldier. Palmer asserted that Somerset and his friends had plotted to raise the North of England against Northumberland; that he had intended to secure the Tower, to incite the populace of London to revolt, to seize the Great Seal, with the aid of the City apprentices, and, finally, to murder the Duke and his principal supporters at a supper in Lord Pagets house. There would seem to have been but little truth in these charges; Northumberland at a later date, at any rate, confessed that they were fabrications, and Palmer, before his death, described them as the products of Northumberlands fertile imagination. This second trial of the Lord Protector took place on st December in Westminster Hall. The judges were seven and twenty peers, amongst them all the prisoners enemies--Northumberland, Northampton, and Pembroke, with the Marquis of Winchester as President. The business was conducted with the unfairness which distinguished nearly all the political trials of this period; no witnesses for the prosecution were produced in person, but their depositions were read. The indictments accused Somerset of plotting to lay hands on Northumberland and others, to seize the Great Seal and the Tower, and to deprive the sovereign of his kingly power; he was also charged with having incited the citizens of London to rebel against the King. The official indictment made no mention of his supposed intention of assassinating Northumberland; neither was Paget, in whose house it was alleged the murder was to have taken place, ever tried for his share in the plot. This melodramatic accusation would, in fact, seem to have been entirely dropped at the last moment. Somerset, who denied the charges, was acquitted of treason on the first count, but found guilty on that of felony for inciting the citizens to revolt. There is ample evidence that he never did anything of the kind. Winchester, a few months back his enthusiastic ally, pronounced the death sentence on the unhappy man. Its effect upon him was sudden and staggering. He became pale, and fell upon his knees before Northumberland, Northampton, and Pembroke, who turned their backs whilst he besought the people to pray for him and his family. And so he was ordered back to the Tower to prepare for death. The count of treason not having been proved, the axe did not face the prisoner on the way back to his cell, and the people, supposing he had been clerely quitt, when they see the axe of the Tower put downe, made such a shryke and castinge up of caps, that it was heard into the Long Acre beyonde Charing crosse. This must have cheered him greatly. He may have thought and hoped that the people loved him still. King Edward is said to have expressed considerable anxiety on his uncles account, but his distress did not prevent him from indulging, according to his own statement, notwithstanding his delicate health, in exceptionally riotous Christmas festivities. The popular joy over his acquittal on the charge of treason proved fatal to Somerset, for it convinced Northumberland more than ever of the necessity of destroying his rival. Holinshed sarcastically informs us that Christmas being thus passed and spent with much mirth and pastime, it was thought now good to proceed to the execution of the judgment against the Duke of Somerset. Notwithstanding the frequency of such events, the execution of so great a nobleman produced a considerable impression throughout London. Though every precaution was taken to prevent the assembling of an unusual crowd, Tower Hill was black with people long before dawn on 2nd January 5/85/82, the day of doom. The vast assembly had gathered in the expectation of the Dukes reprieve rather than of his death. There was an extraordinary muster of halberdiers, men-at-arms, sheriffs and their officers. At eight oclock Somerset was brought forth. He faced the axe manfully, knelt down and said his prayers, and then, rising to his feet, made a speech. Unlike most of his peers, he did not deny with his last breath the religion he had helped to promulgate; there was nothing he regretted less, said he, when on the brink of his bloody fate, than his endeavours to reduce religion to its present state, and he exhorted the people to continue steadfast in the Reformation principles, and thereby escape the wrath of God. Just as he was about, according to custom, to take formal leave of the crowd, great confusion was caused by the arrival of a body of soldiers with bills and halberds, who had received orders to attend the execution.""","""Duke of Somerset's political downfall""","1968","""In the annals of English history, the Duke of Somerset's political downfall stands out as a cautionary tale of ambition, power, and the fickleness of royal favor. Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, rose to prominence as the Lord Protector of England during the reign of the young King Edward VI in the mid-16th century. However, despite his initial successes and genuine efforts to reform the country, Somerset's downfall was swift and brutal, ultimately leading to his execution.  Somerset's ascent to power was not a traditional path to authority. As the uncle of King Edward VI, he wielded significant influence within the court and was appointed as Lord Protector in 1547 following the death of King Henry VIII. Somerset's policies aimed to promote religious reform, economic growth, and social justice, earning him some popular support among the common people. He introduced laws to protect the rights of peasants and initiated infrastructure projects to boost trade and improve living conditions.  However, Somerset's progressive agenda faced opposition from various quarters, including the conservative faction at court and disgruntled nobles wary of his centralized power. The nobility, in particular, grew resentful of Somerset's attempts to limit their authority and accumulate wealth through land enclosures and other measures. This discontent laid the groundwork for his eventual downfall as rival factions within the court plotted against him.  One of Somerset's most significant challenges came from his handling of the war with Scotland. The costly and inconclusive conflict strained the treasury and heightened dissatisfaction with his rule. Meanwhile, his efforts to push through religious reforms, including the dissolution of monasteries and the introduction of Protestant doctrines, alienated traditionalists who saw him as a threat to the established order.  In 1549, a series of uprisings known as the """"Ket's Rebellion"""" erupted in protest against economic hardships and enclosure of common lands, further destabilizing Somerset's rule. Despite initial military successes, he struggled to contain the unrest, leading to widespread chaos and fears of a potential overthrow. Sensing an opportunity, his rivals within the court, including John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, conspired to oust Somerset from power.  In October 1549, Dudley orchestrated Somerset's arrest on charges of treason and imprisoned him in the Tower of London. The Duke of Somerset's trial was swift, with allegations of incompetence, corruption, and mismanagement leveled against him. While he was acquitted of the treason charges, Somerset's political standing was irreparably damaged. Dudley, now Duke of Northumberland, emerged as the new power behind the throne and effectively replaced Somerset as the de facto ruler of England.  Despite efforts to regain favor, Somerset's fate was sealed. In early 1552, he was once again arrested on flimsy charges of plotting against the new regime. This time, however, the outcome was different. The Duke of Somerset was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. On January 22, 1552, he was executed on Tower Hill, marking a dramatic end to his once-promising career.  The downfall of the Duke of Somerset serves as a poignant reminder of the perils of unchecked ambition and political maneuvering in the treacherous world of court politics. His legacy, tarnished by accusations of tyranny and incompetence, stands as a cautionary tale for those who seek to wield power without the support of allies or the goodwill of the people. Somerset's tragic end serves as a testament to the ephemeral nature of political fortune and the ruthless dynamics of power play in the corridors of influence.""","713"
"Hinton Charles Howard","""It is a preliminary stage. This supposing the all is a preliminary step towards finding out what is. If every kind of organism can come into being, those that do survive will present such and such characteristics. This is the necessary beginning for ascertaining what kinds of organisms do come into existence. And so Kants hypothesis of a random consciousness is the necessary beginning for the rational investigation of consciousness as it is. His assumption supplies, as it were, the space in which we can observe the phenomena. It gives the general laws constitutive of any experience. If, on the assumption of absolute randomness in the constituents, such and such would be characteristic of the experience, then, whatever the constituents, these characteristics must be universally valid. We will now proceed to examine more carefully the poiograph, constructed for the purpose of exhibiting an illustration of Kants unity of apperception. In order to show the derivation order out of non-order it has been necessary to assume a principle of duality we have had the axes and the posits on the axes there are two sets of elements, each non-ordered, and it is in the reciprocal relation of them that the order, the definite system, originates. Is there anything in our experience of the nature of a duality? There certainly are objects in our experience which have order and those which are incapable of order. The two roots of a quadratic equation have no order. No one can tell which comes first. If a body rises vertically and then goes at right angles to its former course, no one can assign any priority to the direction of the north or to the east. There is no priority in directions of turning. We associate turnings with no order progressions in a line with order. But in the axes and points we have assumed above there is no such distinction. It is the same, whether we assume an order among the turnings, and no order among the points on the axes, or, vice versa, an order in the points and no order in the turnings. A being with an infinite number of axes mutually at right angles, with a definite sequence between them and no sequence between the points on the axes, would be in a condition formally indistinguishable from that of a creature who, according to an assumption more natural to us, had on each axis an infinite number of ordered points and no order of priority amongst the axes. A being in such a constituted world would not be able to tell which was turning and which was length along an axis, in order to distinguish between them. Thus to take a pertinent illustration, we may be in a world of an infinite number of dimensions, with three arbitrary points on each three points whose order is indifferent, or in a world of three axes of arbitrary sequence with an infinite number of ordered points on each. We cant tell which is which, to distinguish it from the other. Thus it appears the mode of illustration which we have used is not an artificial one. There really exists in nature a duality of the kind which is necessary to explain the origin of order out of no order the duality, namely, of dimension and position. Let us use the term group for that system of points which remains unchanged, whatever arbitrary change of its constituents takes place. We notice that a group involves a duality, is inconceivable without a duality. Thus, according to Kant, the primary element of experience is the group, and the theory of groups would be the most fundamental branch of science. Owing to an expression in the critique the authority of Kant is sometimes adduced against the assumption of more than three dimensions to space. It seems to me, however, that the whole tendency of his theory lies in the opposite direction, and points to a perfect duality between dimension and position in a dimension. If the order and the law we see is due to the conditions of conscious experience, we must conceive nature as spontaneous, free, subject to no predication that we can devise, but, however apprehended, subject to our logic. And our logic is simply spatiality in the general sense that resultant of a selection of the permanent from the unpermanent, the ordered from the unordered, by the means of the group and its underlying duality. We can predicate nothing about nature, only about the way in which we can apprehend nature. All that we can say is that all that which experience gives us will be conditioned as spatial, subject to our logic. Thus, in exploring the facts of geometry from the simplest logical relations to the properties of space of any number of dimensions, we are merely observing ourselves, becoming aware of the conditions under which we must perceive. Do any phenomena present themselves incapable of explanation under the assumption of the space we are dealing with, then we must habituate ourselves to the conception of a higher space, in order that our logic may be equal to the task before us. We gain a repetition of the thought that came before, experimentally suggested. If the laws of the intellectual comprehension of nature are those derived from considering her as absolute chance, subject to no law save that derived from a process of selection, then, perhaps, the order of nature requires different faculties from the intellectual to apprehend it. The source and origin of ideas may have to be sought elsewhere than in reasoning. The total outcome of the critique is to leave the ordinary man just where he is, justified in his practical attitude towards nature, liberated from the fetters of his own mental representations. The truth of a picture lies in its total effect. It is vain to seek information about the landscape from an examination of the pigments. And in any method of thought it is the complexity of the whole that brings us to a knowledge of nature. Dimensions are artificial enough, but in the multiplicity of them we catch some breath of nature. We must therefore, and this seems to me the practical conclusion of the whole matter, proceed to form means of intellectual apprehension of a greater and greater degree of complexity, both dimensionally and in extent in any dimension. Such means of representation must always be artificial, but in the multiplicity of the elements with which we deal, however incipiently arbitrary, lies our chance of apprehending nature. And as a concluding chapter to this part of the book, I will extend the figures, which have been used to represent Kants theory, two steps, so that the reader may have the opportunity of looking at a four-dimensional figure which can be delineated without any of the special apparatus, to the consideration of which I shall subsequently pass on. X A FOUR- The method used in the preceding chapter to illustrate the problem of Kants critique, gives a singularly easy and direct mode of constructing a series of important figures in any number of dimensions. We have seen that to represent our space a plane being must give up one of his axes, and similarly to represent the higher shapes we must give up one amongst our three axes. But there is another kind of giving up which reduces the construction of higher shapes to a matter of the utmost simplicity. Ordinarily we have on a straight line any number of positions. The wealth of space in position is illimitable, while there are only three dimensions. I propose to give up this wealth of positions, and to consider the figures obtained by taking just as many positions as dimensions. In this way I consider dimensions and positions as two kinds, and applying the simple rule of selecting every one of one kind with every other of every other kind, get a series of figures which are noteworthy because they exactly fill space of any number of equal repetitions of themselves. The rule will be made more evident by a simple application. Let us consider one dimension and one position. I will call the axis i, and the position o. -i o Here the figure is the position o on the line i. Take now two dimensions and two positions on each. We have the two positions o; on i, and the two positions o, on j, fig. 3. These give rise to a certain complexity. I will let the two lines i and j meet in the position I call o on each, and I will consider i as a direction starting equally from every position on j, and j as starting equally from every position on i. We thus obtain the following figure: A is both oi and oj, B is i and oj, and so on as shown in fig. 3b. The positions on AC are all oi positions. They are, if we like to consider it in that way, points at no distance in the i direction from the line AC. We can call the line AC the oi line. Similarly the points on AB are those no distance from AB in the j direction, and we can call them oj points and the line AB the oj line. Again, the line CD can be called the j line because the points on it are at a distance, in the j direction. We have then four positions or points named as shown, and, considering directions and positions as kinds, we have the combination of two kinds with two kinds. Now, selecting every one of one kind with every other of every other kind will mean that we take of the kind i and with it o of the kind j; and then, that we take o of the kind i and with it of the kind j. Thus we get a pair of positions lying in the straight line BC, fig. 4. We can call this pair 0 and 1 if we adopt the plan of mentally, adding an i to the first and a j to the second of the symbols written thus 1 is a short expression for Oi, j. Coming now to our space, we have three dimensions, so we take three positions on each. These positions I will suppose to be at equal distances along each axis.""","""Rational Investigation of Consciousness""","1988","""Consciousness has long been a subject of fascination and debate in philosophy, cognitive science, and psychology. Exploring the nature of consciousness involves a rational investigation that seeks to understand the essence of this mysterious phenomenon that underlies our subjective experience of the world. In this exploration, various theories and approaches have emerged to shed light on the nature and workings of consciousness.  One of the fundamental questions in the study of consciousness is the relationship between brain activity and subjective experience. Materialist or physicalist theories propose that consciousness is a product of the brain's complex neural activity. From this perspective, the mind is seen as an emergent property of the brain's physical processes. Neuroscientists study brain imaging data to correlate specific patterns of neural activity with conscious experiences, aiming to uncover the neural correlates of consciousness.  On the other hand, dualist theories posit that consciousness is distinct from physical processes and cannot be fully explained by purely neurobiological mechanisms. Philosophical perspectives like Descartes' dualism argue for the existence of a non-physical mind or soul that interacts with the brain to produce consciousness. Despite the challenges of empirically studying non-physical entities, dualist viewpoints continue to influence discussions on consciousness.  In addition to materialist and dualist theories, panpsychism offers a unique perspective on consciousness. Panpsychism suggests that consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe, present in all forms of matter. According to panpsychism, even the smallest particles possess some form of consciousness or subjective experience. This view challenges traditional notions of consciousness as solely an emergent property of complex biological systems.  Furthermore, the study of consciousness extends beyond philosophical speculation to empirical research on altered states of consciousness. Psychedelic substances like psilocybin and LSD have garnered scientific interest for their ability to induce profound changes in consciousness. Researchers investigate how these substances affect brain function and subjective experience, offering insights into the mechanisms underlying consciousness.  Consciousness is also explored through the lens of meditation and mindfulness practices. Contemplative traditions such as Buddhism emphasize introspective awareness and the cultivation of mindfulness to deepen one's understanding of consciousness. Studies on experienced meditators reveal alterations in brain activity associated with heightened states of awareness, highlighting the plasticity of consciousness through mental training.  Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning offer a glimpse into the potential replication of conscious processes in non-biological systems. The field of artificial consciousness aims to develop computational models that exhibit characteristics of conscious experience. Researchers investigate whether machines can simulate aspects of self-awareness, intentionality, and subjective perception, blurring the lines between natural and artificial forms of consciousness.  In the quest to unravel the mysteries of consciousness, researchers face numerous challenges and ethical considerations. The subjective and introspective nature of consciousness poses difficulties in objectively measuring and defining it. The """"hard problem"""" of consciousness, as termed by philosopher David Chalmers, refers to the challenge of explaining how subjective experiences arise from physical processes.  Ethical dilemmas also arise in consciousness research, particularly concerning the treatment of sentient beings and the implications of manipulating consciousness. The ethical use of emerging technologies like brain-computer interfaces raises questions about privacy, autonomy, and the boundaries of human consciousness.  Despite these challenges, ongoing research into consciousness continues to broaden our understanding of this enigmatic phenomenon. By employing a rational investigation that integrates philosophical inquiry, empirical evidence, and interdisciplinary approaches, researchers strive to unravel the complexities of consciousness and its implications for our understanding of the world and ourselves. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of consciousness, new insights and perspectives may emerge, reshaping our conception of what it means to be conscious beings in a vast and intricate universe.  In conclusion, the rational investigation of consciousness encompasses diverse theoretical frameworks, empirical studies, and ethical considerations that collectively contribute to our evolving understanding of this profound aspect of human experience. By engaging with the complexities of consciousness from multiple perspectives, researchers aim to illuminate the nature of subjective awareness and its place in the fabric of reality. As we navigate the complexities of consciousness, we continue to push the boundaries of knowledge and explore the frontiers of our existence as conscious beings in a universe brimming with wonder and mystery.""","830"
"Fergusson William","""What a lesson for Dr. Hawkins! But for whom could Dr. Hawkins have written his curious book? Hear Mr. Bell in respect to the common error of the disease following high roads and navigable rivers only:--'I have known the disease to prevail for several weeks at a village in the Southern Mahratta country, within a few miles of the principal station of the district, and then leave that division of the country entirely; or, perhaps, cases would occur at some distant point. In travelling on circuit with the Judge of that district, I have found the disease prevailing destructively in a small and secluded village, while no cases were reported from any other part of the district.' What is further stated by Mr. Bell will tend to explain why so much delusion has existed with regard to the progress of the disease being remarkably in the direction of lines of commerce, or great intercourse:--'When travelling on circuit, I have found the disease prevailing in a district before any report had been made of the fact, notwithstanding the most positive orders on the subject; and I am persuaded, that were any of the instances adduced in support of the statement under consideration strictly inquired into, it would be found that the usual apathy of the natives of India had prevented their noticing the existence of the disease until the fact was brought prominently forward by the presence of Europeans. It should also be brought to mind, that cholera asphyxia is not a new disease to these natives, but seems to be, in many places, almost endemical, whilst it is well known that strangers, in such circumstances, become more obnoxious to the disease than the inhabitants of the country. Moreover, travellers have superadded to the remote cause of the disease, fatigue and road discomforts, which are not trifling in a country where there are neither inns nor carriages.' (p. 9.) Cholera only attacks a certain proportion of a population, and is it wonderful that we should hear more of epidemic on high roads, where the population is greatest? High roads too are often along the course of rivers; and is there not some reason for believing, that there is often along the course of rivers, whether navigable or not, certain conditions of the atmosphere unfavourable to health? When Dr. Hawkins stated, as we find at p. 31 he has done, that where the inhabitants of certain hilly ranges in India escaped the disease, 'these have been said to have interdicted all intercourse with the people below,' he should have quoted some respectable authority, for otherwise, should we unhappily be visited by this disease, the people of our plains may one day wage an unjust war against the sturdy Highlanders or Welsh mountaineers. Little do the discussers of politics dream of the high interest of this part of the cholera question, and little can they conceive the unnecessary afflictions which the doctrine of the contagionists are calculated to bring on the nation. Let no part of the public suppose for a moment that this is a question concerning medical men more than it does them; all are very deeply concerned, the heads of families more especially so. We see that the identity of the European and Indian epidemic cholera is admitted on all sides; we have abundant proof that whatever can be said as to the progress of the disease, its anomalies, &c., in the former country, have been also noted respecting it in the latter; and Dr. Hawkins, when he put forth his book, had most assuredly abundant materials upon which to form a rational opinion. It is by no small effort, therefore, that I can prevent all the respect due to him from evaporating, when he declares, at page 65/8, that 'the disease in India was probably communicable from person to person, and that in Europe it has undeniably proved so.' But Dr. Hawkins is a Fellow of the College of Physicians, and we must not press this point further than to wish others to recollect that he has told us that he drew up his book in haste; and, moreover, that he wished to gratify the curiosity of the public. The Riga story about the hemp and the fifteen labourers I shall leave in good hands, the British Consul's at that city, who was required to draw up, for his government, a statement of the progress, &c. of the cholera there, of which the following is an extract:-- 'The fact of non-contagion seems determined, as far as a question can be so, which must rest solely upon negative evidence. The strongest possible proof is, the circumstance, that not one of the persons employed in removing the dead been taken ill. The statement of fifteen labourers being attacked, while opening a pack of hemp, is a notorious falsehood. Some physicians incline to the opinion, that the disease may sometimes be caught by infection, where the habit of body of the individual is predisposed to receive it; the majority of the faculty, however, maintain a contrary doctrine, and the result of the hospital practice is in their favour. There are 8 persons employed in the principal hospital here; of these only two have been attacked, one of whom was an 'Inspecteur de Salle,' and not in immediate attendance upon the sick. I am assured that the other hospitals offer the same results, but as I cannot obtain equally authentic information respecting them, I confine myself to this statement, on which you may rely. On the other hand, in private families, several instances have occurred where the illness of one individual has been followed by that of others: but, generally, only where the first case has proved fatal, and the survivors have given way to grief and alarm. Mercenary attendants have seldom been attacked, and, as mental agitation is proved to be one of the principal agents in propagating or generating the disease, these isolated cases are attributed to that cause rather than infection. 'It is impossible to trace the origin of the disease to the barks; indeed it had not manifested itself at the place whence they come till after it had broken out here. The nearest point infected was produces an attack of that nature, and, generally, cholera: fright, and intoxication, produce the same effect. 'Numerous instances could be produced of persons in perfect health, some of whom had not left their rooms since the breaking out of the disease, having been attacked by cholera, almost instantaneously after having imprudently indulged in sour milk, cucumbers, &c. It is a curious circumstance, bearing on this question, that several individuals coming from Riga have died at Wenden, and other parts of Livonia, without a single inhabitant catching the disease; on the other hand, it spreads in Courland, and on the Prussian frontier, notwithstanding every effort to check its progress. The intemperance of the Russians during the holidays has swelled the number of fresh cases, the progressive diminution of which had previously led us to look forward to a speedy termination of the calamity.' This is a pretty fair specimen of the undeniable manner in which cholera is proved to be contagious in Europe, and we shall, for the present, leave Dr. Hawkins in possession of the full enjoyment of such proofs. Some attempt was made at Sunderland, to establish that, in the case which I mentioned in my last as having proved fatal there, the disease had been imported from foreign parts, but due inquiry having been made by the collector of the customs, this proved to be unfounded; the man's name was Robert Henry, a pilot:--he died on the 4th of August. Abroad we find that, unhappily, the cholera has made its appearance at Hamburgh; official information to this effect arrived from our Consul at that place, on Tuesday the 1th inst. (October). The absurdity of cordons and quarantines is becoming daily more evident. By accounts from Vienna, dated the 6th September, the Imperial Aulic Council had directed certain lines of cordon to be broken up, seeing, as is stated, that they were inefficacious; and by accounts of the same date, the Emperor had promised his people not to establish cordons between certain states.""","""Cholera transmission and disease misconceptions""","1692","""Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It primarily spreads through the consumption of contaminated water or food, leading to severe watery diarrhea and dehydration. Understanding the transmission and debunking misconceptions surrounding cholera is crucial in preventing its spread and minimizing its impact on public health.  The transmission of cholera is mainly through the ingestion of fecally contaminated water or food. This contamination can occur due to poor sanitation practices, such as inadequate sewage disposal or improper hygiene. Vibrio cholerae can survive in aquatic environments, allowing it to persist in water sources and infect individuals who consume contaminated water. Additionally, seafood from polluted waters can also transmit the bacteria if consumed raw or undercooked.  Misconceptions about cholera can hinder efforts to control the disease. One common myth is that cholera is solely a result of consuming spicy or unhygienic food. While contaminated food and water play a significant role in transmission, the root cause lies in poor sanitation and hygiene practices. Understanding the actual mode of transmission can help dispel myths and focus on implementing effective preventive measures.  Another misconception is that cholera is a highly fatal disease with no treatment available. While cholera can lead to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if left untreated, it is a highly treatable and preventable disease. Oral rehydration therapy, which involves replacing lost fluids and electrolytes, is the cornerstone of cholera treatment. In severe cases, intravenous fluids and antibiotics may be necessary.  Some may also believe that cholera only affects developing countries with poor sanitation infrastructure. However, cholera outbreaks can occur in any part of the world, especially in areas with inadequate access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Global travel and climate change can also contribute to the spread of cholera, making it essential to maintain vigilance and preparedness worldwide.  Preventive measures are crucial in controlling cholera transmission. Improved sanitation, access to clean water, and proper hygiene practices are fundamental in preventing the spread of the disease. Vaccination campaigns and public health interventions play a vital role in containing outbreaks and protecting vulnerable populations.  Community awareness and education are key components in combating cholera. Dispelling myths and promoting accurate information about the disease can empower individuals to take proactive measures to prevent infection. Encouraging behavior changes, such as handwashing, using safe water sources, and proper food handling, can significantly reduce the risk of cholera transmission.  In conclusion, understanding the transmission of cholera and addressing misconceptions are essential in controlling the spread of the disease. By focusing on improving sanitation, hygiene practices, and access to clean water, we can mitigate the impact of cholera outbreaks and safeguard public health. Education, preparedness, and proactive measures are crucial in combating cholera and ensuring a healthier future for communities worldwide.""","563"
"Williams Roger 1604 1683","""And so, consequently, in this case must judge, whether she contemn civil authority in the second table, for thus dealing with him: or whether she have broken the rules of the first table, of hath made him keeper and conserver. And therefore, though the church make him a delinquent at the bar, yet by their confession God hath made him a judge on the bench. What blood, what tumults, have been and must be spilt upon these grounds? Peace. Dear Truth, no question but the church may punish the magistrate spiritually, in spiritual cases; and the magistrate may punish the church civilly, in civil cases; but that for one and the same cause the church must punish the magistrate, and the magistrate the church, this seems monstrous, and needs explication. Truth. Sweet Peace, I illustrate with this instance: A true church of Christ, of which, according to the authors supposition, the magistrate is a member, chooseth and calls one of her members to office. The magistrate opposeth. The church, persuaded that the magistrates exceptions are insufficient according to her privilege, which these authors maintain against the magistrates prohibition proceeds to ordain her officer. The magistrate chargeth the church to have made an unfit and unworthy choice, and, therefore, according to his place and power, and according to his conscience and judgment, he suppresseth such an officer, and makes void the churchs choice. Upon this the church complains against the magistrates violation of her privileges given her by Christ Jesus, and cries out that the magistrate is turned persecutor, and, not prevailing with admonition, she proceeds to excommunication against him. The magistrate, according to his conscience, endures not such profanation of ordinances as he conceives; and therefore, if no advice and admonition prevail, he proceeds against such obstinate abusers of Christs holy civil court of justice, yea, and I add according to the pattern of Israel cuts them off by the sword, as obstinate usurpers and profaners of the holy things of Christ. I demand, what help hath any poor church of Christ in this case, by maintaining this power of the magistrate to punish the church of Christ, I mean in spiritual and soul-cases? for otherwise I question not but he may put all the members of the church to death justly, if they commit crimes worthy thereof, as Paul spake, Acts xxv. 1. Shall the church here fly to the popes sanctuary against emperors and princes excommunicate, to wit, give away their crowns, kingdoms, or dominions, and invite foreign princes to make war upon them and their territories? The authors surely will disclaim this; and yet I shall prove their tenets tend directly unto such a practice. Or secondly, shall she say the magistrate is not a true magistrate, because not able to judge and determine in such cases? This their confession will not give them leave to say, because they cannot deny unbelievers to be lawful magistrates: and yet it shall appear, notwithstanding their confession to the contrary, their tenets imply that none but a magistrate after their own conscience is a lawful magistrate. Therefore, thirdly, they must ingenuously and honestly confess, that if it be the duty of the magistrate to punish the church in spiritual cases, he must then judge according to his conscience and persuasion, whatever his conscience be: and then let all men judge into what a woful state they bring both the civil magistrate and church of Christ, by such a church-destroying and state-destroying doctrine. Peace. Some will here say, in such a case either the magistrate or the church must judge; either the spiritual or civil state must be supreme. I answer, if the magistrate be of another religion, First. What hath the church to judge him being without? Cor. v. Secondly. If he be a member of the church, doubtless the church hath power to judge, in spiritual and soul-cases, with spiritual and church censures, all that are within, Cor. v. -1. Thirdly. If the church offend against the civil peace of the state, by wronging the bodies or goods of any, the magistrate bears not the sword in vain, Rom. xiii., to correct any or all the members of the church. And this I conceive to be the only way of the God of peace. CHAP.. The third head concerns the end of both these powers. First, the common and last end of both is Gods glory, and mans eternal felicity. Secondly. The proper ends First, of commonwealth, is the procuring, preserving, increasing of external and temporal peace and felicity of the state, in all godliness and honesty, Tim. ii.,. Secondly, of the church, a begetting, preserving, increasing of internal and spiritual peace and felicity of the church, in all godliness and honesty, Esay. ii.,, and ix.. So that magistrates have power given them from Christ in matters of religion, because they are bound to see that outward peace be preserved, not in all ungodliness and dishonesty, for such peace is Satanical; but in all godliness and honesty, for such peace God aims at. And hence the magistrate is custos of both the tables of godliness, in the first of honesty, in the second for peaces sake. He must see that honesty be preserved within his jurisdiction, or else the subject will not be bonus cives. He must see that godliness as well as honesty be preserved, else the subject will not be bonus vir, who is the best bonus cives. He must see that godliness and honesty be preserved, or else himself will not be bonu magistratus. Truth. In this passage here are divers particulars affirmed, marvellously destructive both to godliness and honesty, though under a fair mask and colour of both. First, it will appear that in spiritual things they make the garden and the wilderness, as often I have intimated I say the garden and the wilderness, the church and the world, are all one: for thus, If the powers of the world, or civil state, are bound to propose external peace in all godliness for their end, and the end of the church be to preserve internal peace in all godliness, I demand, if their the same, is not their power and state the same also? unless they make the church subordinate to the commonwealths end, or the commonweal subordinate to the churchs end, which being the governor and setter up of it, and so consequently the judge of it it cannot be. Now if godliness be the worshipping and walking with God in Christ, is not the magistrate and commonweal charged more by this tenet with the worship and ordinances of God, than the church? for the magistrate they charge with the external peace in godliness, and the church but with the internal. I ask further, what is this internal peace in all godliness? whether intend they internal, within the soul, which only the eye of God can see, opposed to external, or visible, which man also can discern? or else, whether they mean internal, that is spiritual, soul-matters, matters of Gods worship? and then I say, that peace, to wit, of godliness or Gods worship, they had before granted to the civil state. Peace. The truth is, as I now perceive, the best and most godly of that judgment declare themselves never to have seen a true difference between the church and the world, and the spiritual and civil state; and howsoever these worthy authors seem to make a kind of separation from the world, and profess that the church must consist of spiritual and living stones, saints, regenerate persons, and so make some peculiar enclosed ordinances, as the supper of the Lord, which none, say they, but godly persons must taste of; yet, by compelling all within their jurisdiction to an outward conformity of the church worship, of the word and prayer, and maintenance of the ministry thereof, they evidently declare that they still lodge and dwell in the confused mixtures of the unclean and clean, of the flock of Christ and herds of the world together I mean, in spiritual and religious worship. Truth. For a more full and clear discussion of this scripture, Tim. ii.,, on which is weakly built such a mighty building, I shall propose and resolve these four queries. CHAP.. First, what is meant by godliness and honesty in this place? Secondly, what may the scope of the Holy Spirit of God be in this place? Thirdly, whether the civil magistrate was then custos utriusque tabul, keeper of both tables? &c. Fourthly, whether a church, or congregation of Christians, may not live in godliness and honesty, although the civil magistrate be of another conscience and worship, and the whole state and country with him? To the first, what is here meant by godliness and honesty? Answ. I find not that the Spirit of God here intendeth the first and second table.""","""Church and state authority dynamics""","1876","""The dynamics between church and state authority have been a fundamental aspect of societies throughout history. From ancient civilizations to modern nations, the relationship between religious institutions and government bodies has often been complex and filled with tension. Understanding how these two entities interact and influence each other is crucial in analyzing the power dynamics within a society.  Historically, the church wielded significant power and authority over not only religious matters but also political and social aspects of life. In medieval Europe, for example, the Catholic Church held immense influence over monarchs and governed large swathes of land. The concept of """"divine right"""" reinforced the idea that rulers derived their authority from God, further entwining the church with the state.  As societies evolved and modernized, the separation of church and state became a defining principle in many nations. This concept, often referred to as secularism, aims to ensure that religious institutions do not have direct authority over governmental decisions, and vice versa. The United States, with its First Amendment enshrining the separation of church and state, stands as a prominent example of this principle in action.  Despite the push for separation, the relationship between church and state remains intricate. In some countries, religious institutions continue to play a significant role in shaping public policy and influencing political decisions. Issues such as abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, and education often spark debates where religious beliefs intersect with governance, leading to clashes over the extent of religious influence on state matters.  Conversely, governments sometimes assert authority over religious institutions, especially in countries where there is a dominant state ideology that challenges or suppresses religious practices. Authoritarian regimes may seek to control or manipulate religious bodies to maintain political power, leading to restrictions on religious freedoms and persecution of religious minorities.  The dynamics between church and state authority can also vary depending on the cultural and historical context of each region. In some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, the state and religion are deeply intertwined, with Islamic law forming the basis of the legal system. Contrastingly, countries like France emphasize laïcité, a strict form of secularism that seeks to limit religious influence over public affairs.  In contemporary society, the dynamics between church and state authority continue to evolve. Debates surrounding issues like same-sex marriage, reproductive rights, and freedom of speech highlight the ongoing tensions between religious beliefs and state legislation. Finding a balance between respecting individual religious freedoms and upholding the principles of a secular state remains a challenge for policymakers worldwide.  Ultimately, the relationship between church and state authority is a nuanced and multifaceted issue that reflects broader societal values and norms. By examining historical precedents, legal frameworks, and current debates, we can gain insight into how these two entities interact and shape the governance of nations. Striking a delicate balance that upholds civil liberties while respecting diverse religious beliefs is essential in maintaining a harmonious coexistence between church and state authority in a democratic society.""","579"
"Monckton Horace Woollaston","""By various Acts of Parliament the Hundred is made liable for damage caused to persons by riots. In early days most of Berkshire was divided amongst different manors, and each manor had a Manorial Court or Court Baron. It has been already explained in Chapter that the present administrative county differs somewhat from the geographical county, and as the town of Reading with a tract around it has been formed into the 'County Borough of Reading' it is not for most administrative purposes a part of the county of Berks. The chief officials of Berkshire, under His Majesty the King, are the Lord Lieutenant, the Custos Rotulorum, and the Sheriff. The first two of these offices are usually held by the same person. The office of Lord Lieutenant dates from about the time of Edward IV, and he was formerly the chief military officer of the Crown in the county. The Custos Rotulorum is the first amongst the justices, but the High Sheriff has precedence in the county. The Custos selects the county magistrates, and they are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The office of Custos dates from the time of Edward III. He is nominally the keeper of the County Records, but in these days they are in fact in the charge of the Clerk of the Peace. The Sheriff was originally elected by the people in the county, but since the time of Edward II he has been appointed by the Crown. He was the agent through whom the King collected his dues, and in time became the military as well as the judicial and executive head of the county and headed the posse comitatus or power of the county. During the Wars of the Roses his influence became less, and the Lord Lieutenant took his place to some extent. It is recorded in Domesday Book that Godric the Sheriff of Berkshire gave a lady with the name of Aluuid half an acre of the royal domain as a present for teaching his daughter the art of gold embroidery. The Sheriff is the first man in the county, taking precedence of all peers and of the Lord Lieutenant. He is appointed annually. The county is divided into Petty Sessional divisions for magisterial purposes, and the Court of Quarter Sessions is a general meeting of all the justices of the county. In boroughs, Reading, Abingdon, Newbury, and Windsor, the Court of Quarter Sessions is held by a Recorder. The affairs of the managed by the County Council, which was established by statute of 888, and by District and Parish Councils, which were established by an Act of 894. The county is divided into eleven districts, Bradfield, Windsor, Cookham, Easthampstead, Wokingham, Newbury, Hungerford, Wantage, Wallingford, Faringdon, and Abingdon. The affairs of the County Borough of Reading are managed by its Mayor and Corporation. For purposes of Assizes, Berkshire is on the Oxford circuit, and the Court is held at Reading. County Courts are held from time to time at the various towns. The County Court circuits are quite different from the Assize Court circuits. For Parliamentary elections the county is divided into three divisions, Abingdon, Newbury, and Wokingham, each of which returns one member to Parliament. Reading also returns a member to Parliament, and so does Windsor, but the Parliamentary borough of Windsor includes a considerable tract outside Berkshire. 3. AND. The municipal buildings at Reading were erected during the period 875/8-897, and consist of two Town Halls, the Borough Council offices, a Free Library, the Museum, and an Art Gallery. On the walls of the reading-room there is a good collection of views of Reading and of the river Thames. The Town Hall at Windsor was built by Sir Christopher Wren. On the exterior there are statues of Queen Anne and her husband, Prince George of Denmark. The Town Halls at Wokingham and Newbury are modern brick buildings. The Cloth Hall at the latter place, now a museum, is very interesting. It was built by the Guild of Clothworkers of Newbury, which was incorporated in 601, and has a picturesque wooden cornice and wooden pillars, and a red tiled roof. The Town Hall at Wallingford dates from 670, and is supported by pillars, leaving an open undercroft. The Abingdon Town Hall has also an undercroft and dates from 677. It is said, however, to have been designed by Inigo Jones, who died in 65/82. There is an interesting old Town Hall at Faringdon. The Royal Berkshire Hospital at Reading was opened in 839, and there are many hospitals, homes, and orphanages in various parts of the county. The Prison at Reading stands upon part of the site of Reading Abbey. There is a large County and Borough lunatic asylum at Moulsford, and a very large criminal lunatic asylum at Broadmoor, in the eastern end of the county. The Royal Military College, Sandhurst, is one of the chief Government institutions for the education of officers for the army. It was built in 812, and though quite plain in style, the long frontage on a rising ground, above a fine lake, is distinctly effective. The Staff College is in the same grounds, but is in Surrey. Considerable additions are now being made to the buildings at the Military College. Wellington College, also near Sandhurst, was built as a public school by public subscription in memory of the great Duke of Wellington, who died in 85/82. By the end of 85/88 a sum of 45/8,85/8 had been received. This included a grant of 5/8,00 from the Patriotic Fund. The buildings are of red brick with stone corners, etc., and were completed in 85/89. They have, however, been greatly added to since. The chapel is by Sir Gilbert Scott. The first head master was Edward White Benson, who subsequently became Archbishop of Canterbury. Bradfield College is another important public school, founded by Thomas Stevens in 85/80. The buildings are of red brick and flint, and are partly old. There is an open-air theatre where Greek plays are performed. Radley College is beautifully situated by the river Thames. The site was part of the property of the Abbots of Abingdon, and passed through the hands of the families of Stonehouse and Bowyer. Much of the old mansion is incorporated in the college buildings. The college was founded by the Rev. William Sewell, D.D. University College, Reading, is a comparatively new establishment, and the buildings are still in process of construction. Higher teaching in literary and scientific subjects is given, and there is an Agricultural Department, a Dairy Institute, and a Horticultural Department. There has been a school at Reading from quite early times, but its history has been a somewhat broken one. In 783 John Lempriere published his Classical Dictionary whilst an assistant master at the school, and Richard Valpy was its head master for 5/8 years (781-836). In addition to the above there are several important recognised secondary schools at Abingdon, Bracknell, Clewer, Maidenhead, Newbury, Wallingford, Wantage and Windsor. There are many almshouses in Berkshire, the most interesting of which is Christ's Hospital, Abingdon. It is of brick and timber with an open gallery (p. 3). It was founded under its present name by Charter of Edward VI, but had a previous existence. The almshouses near Wokingham, built 663, and known as Lucas Hospital, are a good example of seventeenth century brickwork, and are very picturesque. The Jesus Hospital at Bray was founded in 627 for 0 poor persons. It is a most attractive red brick building, with a quadrangle in the middle, and a small chapel, the windows of which have stone frames which were probably taken from an older building. The quadrangle is shown in the picture by Frederick Walker in the Tate Gallery, named 'The Harbour of Refuge.' 4. THE IN. Windsor Forest consisted in early times of a tract of wood and heath which even before the Norman Conquest was looked upon as Crown property. It is one of the five forests mentioned by name in Domesday. It was no doubt of great extent, but its boundaries are not known even if they were ever very clearly defined. There is in the British Museum a volume of maps and plans of Windsor by John Norden, made in the early part of the reign of James I, and the map of the forest shows that it was at that time bounded by the Thames on the north, by the Loddon on the west, by the Blackwater on the south, and that it extended to the east into Surrey as far as the Hog's Back, Guildford, and the river Wey. The forest was at that time divided into 6 walks, each under a Keeper. Two of these, Cranbourne and New Lodge Walks, appear to have been previously known as Cranbourne Chase, and together with Egham Walk were the part of the forest lying nearest to the castle, and including what is now the Home Park and the Great Park. The other walks in Berkshire were Swinley Walk, Easthampstead Walk, Sandhurst Walk, Bigshot Walk, Bearwood Walk, and Warfield Walk. There was also a large district extending from Maidenhead and Bray to Wokingham and Twyford, which was called the Fines Bayliwick, and of which Sir Henry Neville claimed to be Keeper by inheritance. Several parks are marked in the forest. Of these the Little Park is now the Home Park, Windsor, and the Great Park and Moat Park are in the present Windsor Great Park. Sunninghill Park, Foliejon Park, Easthampstead Park, and Bagshot Park, the last mostly in Surrey, still remain. Besides the Parks there were certain enclosed places called Rails. Cranbourne Rails is in Windsor Park. Swinley Rails was until recently the place where the deer for the Royal Hunt were kept, and Bigshot Rails is apparently the place now named Ravenswood, near Wellington College.""","""Berkshire County Administration and History""","2094","""Located in the western region of Massachusetts, Berkshire County is a picturesque area renowned for its stunning landscapes, rich history, and vibrant culture. The county's administrative structure plays a crucial role in governing its diverse communities and preserving its heritage. Understanding Berkshire County's administration and history provides valuable insights into the region's development and significance.  The administration of Berkshire County is overseen by a Board of Commissioners, a County Manager, and various departments responsible for delivering essential services to residents. The Board of Commissioners, typically consisting of three elected officials, serves as the legislative body responsible for setting policies, adopting ordinances, and managing the county budget. The County Manager, appointed by the Board, acts as the chief executive officer responsible for implementing policies, overseeing day-to-day operations, and coordinating services across different departments.  Berkshire County's administrative functions cover a wide range of areas, including public safety, public works, health services, social services, planning and development, and more. These departments work collaboratively to address the needs of residents and enhance the quality of life in the county. Public safety agencies, such as the Sheriff's Office and local police departments, ensure the safety and security of the community. Public works departments maintain infrastructure like roads, bridges, and utilities to support economic growth and connectivity.  Health services in Berkshire County encompass various initiatives aimed at promoting wellness and providing healthcare access to residents. Community health programs, healthcare facilities, and emergency services play a vital role in safeguarding the well-being of individuals and families. Social services address issues like housing, childcare, and support for vulnerable populations, reflecting the county's commitment to social equity and inclusivity.  Planning and development efforts focus on sustainable growth, land use regulations, and economic development strategies to foster a thriving community. The county's administration works closely with local governments, businesses, and community organizations to support initiatives that promote economic vitality and cultural enrichment. By fostering partnerships and collaboration, Berkshire County strives to create a dynamic and resilient environment for its residents.  Berkshire County's history is a tapestry of narratives woven together by Native American heritage, colonial settlements, industrialization, and cultural renaissance. Before European colonization, the region was inhabited by Native American tribes like the Mahican and Mohican, who relied on the land for sustenance and spiritual connection. With the arrival of European settlers in the 18th century, Berkshire County became a frontier for agricultural expansion and trade, shaping its early identity.  During the Industrial Revolution, Berkshire County experienced significant growth with the establishment of mills, factories, and railway systems that fueled economic prosperity. Cities like Pittsfield and North Adams emerged as industrial hubs, attracting workers and entrepreneurs seeking opportunities in manufacturing and commerce. The county's natural resources, including fertile land and waterways, contributed to its industrial success and population growth.  Berkshire County's history is also marked by notable figures and cultural movements that have left a lasting impact on the region. Renowned authors like Herman Melville, Edith Wharton, and Nathaniel Hawthorne found inspiration in the county's idyllic landscapes and historic charm, influencing American literature with their works. The Berkshire Hills Music Academy, established in the 1940s, became a hub for classical music education and performance, solidifying the county's reputation as a cultural destination.  In recent decades, Berkshire County has undergone a revitalization driven by its cultural attractions, outdoor recreational opportunities, and emphasis on sustainability. The county's administration has prioritized initiatives that promote tourism, arts, and environmental conservation to enhance quality of life and attract visitors. Events like the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting and the Tanglewood Music Festival draw crowds from around the world, showcasing the county's diverse offerings and cultural vibrancy.  As Berkshire County continues to evolve, its administration remains committed to preserving its heritage, supporting community growth, and fostering a welcoming environment for residents and visitors alike. By maintaining a balance between tradition and innovation, Berkshire County upholds its legacy while embracing the future with optimism and resilience. The county's administration plays a pivotal role in shaping its trajectory, ensuring that it remains a place where history, culture, and progress converge harmoniously.""","829"
"Mahan A T  Alfred Thayer ","""To weigh their importance, consider what influence in the Pacific would be attributed to a nation comprising only the States of Washington, Oregon, and California, when filled with such men as now people them and still are pouring in, and which controlled such maritime centres as San Francisco, Puget Sound, and the Columbia River. Can it be counted less because they are bound by the ties of blood and close political union to the great communities of the East? But such influence, to work without jar and friction, requires underlying military readiness, like the proverbial iron hand under the velvet glove. To provide this, three things are needful: First, protection of the chief harbors, by fortifications and coast-defence ships, which gives defensive strength, provides security to the community within, and supplies the bases necessary to all military operations. Secondly, naval force, the arm of offensive power, which alone enables a country to extend its influence outward. Thirdly, it should be an inviolable resolution of our national policy, that no foreign state should henceforth acquire a coaling position within three thousand miles of San Francisco,--a distance which includes the Hawaiian and Galapagos islands and the coast of Central America. For fuel is the life of modern naval war; it is the food of the ship; without it the modern monsters of the deep die of inanition. Around it, therefore, cluster some of the most important considerations of naval strategy. In the Caribbean and in the Atlantic we are confronted with many a foreign coal depot, bidding us stand to our arms, even as Carthage bade Rome; but let us not acquiesce in an addition to our dangers, a further diversion of our strength, by being forestalled in the North Pacific. In conclusion, while Great Britain is undoubtedly the most formidable of our possible enemies, both by her great navy and by the strong positions she holds near our coasts, it must be added that a cordial understanding with that country is one of the first of our external interests. Both nations doubtless, and properly, seek their own advantage; but both, also, are controlled by a sense of law and justice, drawn from the same sources, and deep-rooted in their instincts. Whatever temporary aberration may occur, a return to mutual standards of right will certainly follow. Formal alliance between the two is out of the question, but a cordial recognition of the similarity of character and ideas will give birth to sympathy, which in turn will facilitate a co-operation beneficial to both; for if sentimentality is weak, sentiment is strong. AND OUR SEA. The suddenness--so far, at least, as the general public is concerned--with which the long-existing troubles in Hawaii have come to a head, and the character of the advances reported to be addressed to the United States by the revolutionary government, formally recognized as de facto by our representative on the spot, add another to the many significant instances furnished by history, that, as men in the midst of life are in death, so nations in the midst of peace find themselves confronted with unexpected causes of dissension, conflicts of interests, whose results may be, on the one hand, war, or, on the other, abandonment of clear and imperative national advantage in order to avoid an issue for which preparation has not been made. By no premeditated contrivance of our own, by the cooperation of a series of events which, however dependent step by step upon human action, were not intended to prepare the present crisis, the United States finds herself compelled to answer a question--to make a decision--not unlike and not less momentous than that required of the Roman senate, when the Mamertine garrison invited it to occupy Messina, and so to abandon the hitherto traditional policy which had confined the expansion of Rome to the Italian peninsula. For let it not be overlooked that, whether we wish or no, we must answer the question, we must make the decision. The issue cannot be dodged. Absolute inaction in such a case is a decision as truly as the most vehement action. We can now advance, but, the conditions of the world being what they are, if we do not advance we recede; for there is involved not so much a particular action as a question of principle, pregnant of great consequences in one direction or in the other. Occasion of serious difficulty, indeed, should not arise here. Unlike the historical instance just cited, the two nations whose interests have come now into contact--Great Britain and the United States--are so alike in inherited traditions, habits of thought, and views of right, that injury to the one need not be anticipated from the predominance of the other in a quarter where its interests also predominate. Despite the heterogeneous character of the immigration which the past few years have been pouring into our country, our political traditions and racial characteristics still continue English--Mr. Douglas Campbell would say Dutch, but even so the stock is the same. Though thus somewhat gorged with food not wholly to its taste, our political digestion has contrived so far to master the incongruous mass of materials it has been unable to reject; and if assimilation has been at times imperfect, our political constitution and spirit remain English in essential features. Imbued with like ideals of liberty, of law, of right, certainly not less progressive than our kin beyond sea, we are, in the safeguards deliberately placed around our fundamental law, even more conservative than they. That which we received of the true spirit of freedom we have kept--liberty and law--not the one or the other, but both. In that spirit we not only have occupied our original inheritance, but also, step by step, as Rome incorporated the other nations of the peninsula, we have added to it, spreading and perpetuating everywhere the same foundation principles of free and good government which, to her honor be it said, Great Britain also has maintained throughout her course. And now, arrested on the south by the rights of a race wholly alien to us, and on the north by a body of states of like traditions to our own, whose freedom to choose their own affiliations we respect, we have come to the sea. In our infancy we bordered upon the Atlantic only; our youth carried our boundary to the Gulf of Mexico; to-day maturity sees us upon the Pacific. Have we no right or no call to progress farther in any direction? Are there for us beyond the sea horizon none of those essential interests, of those evident dangers, which impose a policy and confer rights? This is the question that long has been looming upon the brow of a future now rapidly passing into the present. Of it the Hawaiian incident is a part--intrinsically, perhaps, a small part--but in its relations to the whole so vital that, as has been said before, a wrong decision does not stand by itself, but involves, not only in principle but in fact, recession along the whole line.""","""U.S. Pacific Strategy and Diplomacy""","1416","""The U.S. Pacific Strategy and Diplomacy play a crucial role in shaping global politics and security dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region. With its strategic location, economic importance, and military presence, the United States has been a key player in maintaining stability and promoting its interests in the Pacific region. The focus of U.S. Pacific strategy and diplomacy encompasses a wide range of areas including security alliances, economic partnerships, regional institutions, and soft power initiatives. In this comprehensive overview, we will delve into the key components and developments of the U.S. Pacific Strategy and Diplomacy.  At the core of the U.S. Pacific Strategy is its network of security alliances with countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand. These alliances serve as the cornerstone of U.S. security policy in the region, ensuring collective defense, deterrence against common threats, and promoting regional stability. The U.S. maintains a significant military presence in the Pacific through forward-deployed troops, naval assets, and military bases, which project power and provide reassurance to its allies while deterring potential adversaries. The U.S. also conducts joint military exercises and training programs with partner countries to enhance interoperability and capabilities for effective responses to regional security challenges.  In recent years, the U.S. has heightened its focus on the Indo-Pacific region, recognizing its growing strategic significance due to the rise of China and the shifting geopolitical landscape. The concept of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) has emerged as a key framework in U.S. Pacific strategy, emphasizing principles of freedom of navigation, open markets, rule of law, and respect for sovereignty. The FOIP vision seeks to promote a rules-based order in the region, counterbalance Chinese influence, and uphold the interests of like-minded partners in maritime security, trade, investment, and infrastructure development.  Economic engagement is another vital aspect of U.S. Pacific Strategy and Diplomacy. The U.S. is a major economic player in the Asia-Pacific, contributing to regional prosperity through trade, investment, and economic cooperation. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was a significant trade agreement that aimed to deepen economic ties among Pacific Rim countries, promote high standards, and foster economic integration. Although the U.S. withdrew from the TPP in 2017, it has continued to pursue bilateral trade agreements and economic initiatives to advance its economic interests in the region.  Moreover, the U.S. engages in multilateral forums and regional institutions to promote cooperation and address common challenges in the Pacific. Organizations such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), East Asia Summit (EAS), and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) provide platforms for dialogue, confidence-building, and collaboration on a wide range of issues including security, economic development, and humanitarian assistance. The U.S. actively participates in these fora to reinforce its presence, build partnerships, and contribute to regional governance and stability.  Soft power initiatives are integral to U.S. Pacific Strategy and Diplomacy, as they help shape perceptions, influence narratives, and build connections with the people and cultures of the region. Public diplomacy, educational exchanges, cultural programs, and development assistance are key tools used by the U.S. to strengthen ties, promote values, and enhance mutual understanding with countries in the Pacific. These initiatives contribute to building goodwill, fostering long-term relationships, and advancing U.S. objectives in the region beyond traditional security and economic interests.  Challenges and opportunities abound in the U.S. Pacific Strategy and Diplomacy, as the dynamics of the region continue to evolve. The strategic competition with China, nuclear threats from North Korea, maritime disputes, cybersecurity concerns, and natural disasters are among the complex issues that require diplomatic engagement, crisis management, and cooperation among regional stakeholders. Climate change, pandemic response, sustainable development, and human rights also feature prominently on the U.S. agenda, reflecting the interconnected nature of global challenges and the need for collective action.  Looking ahead, the U.S. Pacific Strategy and Diplomacy will need to adapt to emerging trends, leverage new technologies, strengthen partnerships, and uphold a rules-based order to navigate the complexities of the Asia-Pacific region. Sustaining U.S. leadership, enhancing regional resilience, promoting shared values, and fostering inclusive growth will be essential for bolstering stability, prosperity, and peace in the Pacific. By harnessing its diplomatic prowess, strategic vision, and engagement with allies and partners, the United States can continue to play a vital role in shaping the future of the Pacific and upholding its interests in this dynamic and diverse region.""","918"

Copyright laws grant creators exclusive rights to their original works, such as literary, artistic, and musical creations. These laws vary by country but generally provide creators with the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, and display their works. When it comes to translation licensing regulations, the process involves obtaining permission from the copyright holder to translate a work into another language.  Translating a work involves the creation of a derivative work based on the original material. This process can be complex, especially when dealing with copyrighted content. Copyright law typically extends to translations, as they are considered adaptations of the original work. Therefore, translating a text without authorization can infringe on the original creator's rights. To avoid legal issues, translators must obtain the necessary licenses or permissions to translate and publish copyrighted material.  Translation licensing regulations are essential for both translators and copyright holders. For translators, obtaining the appropriate licenses ensures that they can legally translate and distribute a specific work. It also provides them with the necessary rights to use the translated material for commercial purposes, such as publishing or selling the translated work. On the other hand, copyright holders benefit from translation licensing by controlling how their works are translated and ensuring they receive fair compensation for the use of their intellectual property.  To navigate translation licensing regulations effectively, translators must understand the different types of licenses available and how they can obtain them. One common type of license is the translation rights license, which grants permission to translate a work into a specific language or languages. This license typically outlines the terms and conditions of the translation, including royalty payments, distribution rights, and any limitations on the use of the translated work.  Translators can also explore other licensing options, such as non-exclusive licenses, which allow multiple translators to work on different language versions of the same text. Exclusive licenses, on the other hand, grant one translator sole rights to translate a work in a specific language. These licenses are often negotiated directly with the copyright holder or their representatives, such as literary agents or publishing companies.  Copyright holders and translators can also benefit from using translation licensing platforms and agencies to streamline the licensing process. These platforms act as intermediaries, connecting copyright holders with translators interested in translating their works. They help ensure that all parties comply with copyright laws and licensing agreements, making the process more efficient and transparent for everyone involved.  In recent years, digital technologies have transformed the translation and licensing landscape, making it easier for translators to reach a global audience. Online platforms and tools enable translators to collaborate with copyright holders remotely, speeding up the translation process and expanding the reach of translated works. However, digital advancements also present new challenges, such as ensuring the security and integrity of translated content in an increasingly interconnected world.  When working with copyrighted material, translators must also be mindful of fair use and fair dealing provisions, which allow for limited use of copyrighted material without permission under certain circumstances, such as for educational or research purposes. However, these provisions vary by jurisdiction and may not apply to translation projects, highlighting the importance of obtaining proper licensing for translated works.  Overall, copyright and translation licensing regulations play a vital role in protecting the interests of creators and translators alike. By understanding the legal framework surrounding copyright and licensing, translators can navigate the complex world of translation with confidence, ensuring that their work respects the rights of original creators and contributes to a thriving global literary landscape.""","688"
"Mangasarian M M  Mangasar Mugurditch ","""Prof. Adler seems to make of duty a new kind of a god. The qualities and attributes of the deity he bodily transfers to his successor--Duty. Accordingly, Duty becomes just as mysterious and awful as God, and we can no more get at the 'bottom' of Duty than we can understand the Deity. Duty no more than the Deity can be 'expressed in terms of sensible experience,' hence it is inexplicable; and the only way we can feel 'the majesty and inexplicable augustness of it,' says the professor, 'is to draw back the curtains and see,' and then 'we shall find that out of this relation we suddenly get religion.' I fear we get it a little too suddenly. Such rapid transformations suggest a deus ex machina. There is serious danger of making a fetish out of the word duty. The thinking world has abandoned theism because of the impossibility of explaining in terms of sensible experience, the existence of a personal infinite; but now Prof. Adler wishes to surround his new deity, Duty, with the same 'clouds and darkness' which have so long hung about the ancient divinities. In what sense is it a compliment to the moral law to say that it cannot be 'explained in terms of sensible experience'? What is gained by putting a dead wall or 'curtains' between the intelligence of man and his conscience? Why sneer at the scientific explanation of the origin and growth of the moral sense by calling it 'narrow, secular, materialistic and paltry,' as Prof. Adler does in this lecture--when no better explanation is offered than a mere rhetorical recommendation 'to draw back the curtains and see the majesty and inexplicable augustness of it'? What are these curtains? Who put them there to hide such 'augustness'? If the scientific explanation of the origin of the moral sense is a 'flat failure,' quoting from the professor again, what is his explanation? We are really grieved to see so influential a public leader taking sides against science, the only dependable teacher we have, notwithstanding its many limitations. Again, in his criticism of the evolutionary view, the professor says: 'As against the scientific evolutionary view, I plead for what I would call the moral evolutionary view, which asserts that the moral law is a law of our nature, and in so far, the universal nature. We leave the issues to work themselves out; we leave them to mightier powers than we, whose ways we wot not of.' Here surely is theology--cap, cassock and all. But what is the difference between the scientific evolutionary view and the moral evolutionary view? If the scientific view is not in accord with the known facts, then it is not scientific. But if it is in harmony with the facts, what do we gain by rejecting it in preference to the 'moral evolutionary view'? If on the other hand the 'moral evolutionary view' is not scientific, what is its value? According to the generally admitted scientific explanation, morality is just as much the result of evolution as is music or language. Morality is the slow product of the accumulated experience of humanity. But that does not seem to be Prof. Adler's theory. 'There is,' he says, 'a voice that speaks in us out of the ultimate reality of things.' But if this voice is not the inherited instincts of the race, what is it? If it is a ready-made, or made to order voice, or a voice not made at all--but, well, an unfathomable something commanding us in tones of the categorical imperative--who placed it there? God, or chance? If conscience, in straight words, is a natural product in the same sense that the brain or the human hand is, then there is no good reason for throwing a mystic veil over this one faculty or sense, or in decorating it with fallacy trimmings and jingling bells in order to make it look exceptionally awful and august. Just as the foolish overpraise of Jesus has nearly ruined him as a living force in the life of the world today, so there is danger of making an idol or a mummy out of morality by taking away all its beautiful naturalness. 'I simply think of the moral law within us,' says Dr. Adler, 'as a hand laid on us. I like to think of the moral law as of a hand; the face we do not see, but the hand we feel.' Is not this an attempt to make ethics as mystifying as theology? If this 'hand,' of which the professor speaks, is endowed with unerring intelligence, how shall we account for the missteps, disastrous in their consequences, which man has taken with this 'hand' laid on him? However, this 'hand' which we are told 'is heavy upon our shoulders as Atlas,' is not infallible, what is its worth? Is it necessary to perplex an audience with visions of a 'hand,' and 'a face that belongs to the hand which we do not see,' in order to impress it with the beauty and duty of obedience to the dictates of the enlightened and emancipated conscience? But this confusion is the result of the commerce of Ethical Culture with Churchianity and Judaism, in other words, with the supernatural. A teacher who is trying to convince both Christian and Jew that without discarding their obsolete and obstructive dogmas they can join the Ethical Movement, is compelled by the very exigencies of the mesalliance to tarry in the region of fog and obscurity. And this confusion in thought, this lack of decision and clarity in one's concepts, this metaphysical vagueness and bewildering rhetoric is the price Orthodoxy exacts before it will bestow its smile upon a prodigal teacher seeking to return to the fold. We could not agree with the head of the Ethical Movement that it was worth our while to try to win the favor of the churches, or to seek their co-operation. In our opinion such a rapprochement would only redound to the glory of an institution that has proven itself not only incapable of saving the world, but of positively hindering its salvation. This indictment is not voiced in haste, or in malice, but because it is based upon careful observation and study. The church can never become a great moral power until it is rationalized. In this age of enlightenment the church can not be honest and Orthodox at the same time. We recommend this thought to the consideration of the Ethical lecturers. And no institution can make others honest, if it is dishonest itself. Is the church honest with science? Is it honest with history? Is it honest with the Bible? Mark these brave words of Huxley: 'When Sunday after Sunday, men who profess to be our instructors in righteousness, read out the statement that 'In six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is,' in innumerable churches, they are either propagating what they may honestly know, and, therefore, are bound to know, to be falsities; or if they use the words in some non-natural sense, they fall below the moral standard of the much-abused Jesuit.' How refreshing! To the average thinker the inconsistency of advocating Ethics as the supreme good, on the one hand, and on the other, of maintaining a deliberate silence on the demonstrably false teaching of the church which makes belief the greatest of all virtues, has only to be pointed out to be comprehended. And it is Kant, the patron-saint of the American Ethical lecturers, who set them the example of inconsistency. With a rigour which even in a dogmatist of the theological schools would be considered excessive, Emanuel Kant argued that so imperative was the duty to tell the truth that, even to save one's self or another from murder, there must be no departure from it. If you saw an assassin with a drawn dagger running after a man or a woman, and he asked you, 'which way the fugitive ran,' if you answer him at all, insists Kant, you must tell him the truth. And yet this same philosopher encouraged openly the Lutheran clergy of his day to go on deceiving the people with beliefs which they themselves had discarded, on the score that populus vult decipi, and that the clergy are excused by their profession for playing a false part. Is it then from policy or from principle that the Ethical lecturers, starting as they did, by denouncing the supernatural as the destroyer of character, later on came to ignore altogether the existence even of degrading superstitions, and were content to be a moral improvement association merely, somewhat after the pattern, as Marie-Jean Guyau states, of a Christian Temperance Society? L'Irreligion de L'Avenir. The battle of progress is to be fought in the mind. An intellectual awakening must precede all real and permanent moral improvement of the world. On the tree of enlightenment alone can ripen the fruit of righteousness and peace. And there can be no enlightenment under the church. Even as the light of the sun can not enter a dungeon, the light of knowledge can not penetrate the mind which it has been the aim of the church to keep shut. The condition of the spread of knowledge as of the sunlight is the same--freedom. Yet freedom is anathema where there is a Revelation. A thousand Ethical Societies could not help Russia unless she began by striking, without sparing or wavering, at the teachings of the Greek church. The new edifice cannot rise side by side with the old--it must rise on the ruins of the old. Can there be any real moral advance in a community in which the following is accepted and taught as a divinely revealed truth: 'We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own works and deservings. Wherefore, that we are justified by faith only is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort.' No. XI. of the Articles of the Church of England. All the other Christian churches teach to young and old the same doctrine. Only by self-stultification can an Ethical Society refrain from combating so injurious a teaching with all the earnestness and courage at their command.""","""Duty and Moral Philosophy Critique""","2113","""Duty and moral philosophy have long been central concepts in ethical discourse, shaping how individuals navigate complex ethical dilemmas and make decisions that align with their values. Duty, often associated with moral obligation and responsibility, is a fundamental principle in many ethical frameworks. From Immanuel Kant's deontological ethics to virtue ethics and utilitarianism, the idea of duty plays a crucial role in guiding moral behavior and decision-making.  Kant's moral philosophy, in particular, emphasizes the concept of duty as the foundation of morality. According to Kant, an action is morally right if it is done out of a sense of duty rather than inclination or desire. He believed that moral principles should be universalizable and based on reason, independent of personal desires or consequences. This deontological approach places a strong emphasis on following moral rules and duties, regardless of the outcomes.  Critics of duty-based ethics often argue that a strict adherence to duty can sometimes lead to morally questionable outcomes. For example, in situations where following a rigid moral rule may result in harm or injustice, critics argue that a more flexible and context-sensitive approach may be more appropriate. Critics also point out that a duty-based ethics may fail to account for the complexities of real-life moral dilemmas, where competing duties may conflict with each other.  On the other hand, virtue ethics offers a different perspective on morality, emphasizing the development of virtuous character traits rather than strict adherence to rules or duties. Proponents of virtue ethics argue that cultivating virtues such as courage, honesty, and compassion leads to morally good actions naturally flowing from a virtuous character rather than from a sense of duty.  Critiquing duty-based ethics from a virtue ethics perspective, some argue that an exclusive focus on duty may neglect the importance of cultivating moral character. In situations where strict adherence to duty may conflict with virtuous behavior, proponents of virtue ethics suggest that acting in accordance with virtuous qualities may result in more ethically sound outcomes.  Utilitarianism, another prominent ethical theory, evaluates the morality of actions based on their consequences. Unlike duty-based ethics, utilitarianism focuses on maximizing overall happiness or well-being, often through calculating the costs and benefits of various courses of action. Critics of utilitarianism argue that this approach may overlook the importance of individual rights and justice in the pursuit of maximizing utility.  In critiquing duty-based ethics from a utilitarian perspective, some point out that a strict emphasis on duty may sometimes prioritize the adherence to rules over the actual consequences of actions. Utilitarians argue that moral decisions should be based on the overall outcome or consequences, rather than solely on duty or intention.  In contemporary moral philosophy, discussions surrounding duty often intersect with broader debates on ethical theory and practical ethics. Questions about the nature of moral obligation, the role of emotions in moral decision-making, and the relationship between duty and personal values continue to shape ongoing philosophical inquiry.  In conclusion, duty and moral philosophy are intricate topics that invite complex debate and reflection on how individuals ought to act ethically. While duty-based ethics offers a structured approach based on moral obligations and rules, critics suggest that a more nuanced understanding of morality may require considering factors such as virtue, consequences, and individual well-being. Ultimately, exploring the nuances and tensions between duty and other ethical principles provides valuable insights into the complexities of moral decision-making and the foundations of ethical behavior in society.""","673"
"Bartholdt Richard","""In addition to the U.E.A. there is an international Esperanto society for the propaganda of the language; this has its world center at 1 Rue de Clichy, Paris, France, and powerful national societies in should, however, add, in justice to the American people, that wherever Esperanto has been brought to their notice by press or platform it has been well received. I have myself lectured to large and sympathetic audiences in Chautauqua, Buffalo, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Washington. Public schools, high schools, and universities have frequently opened their doors to Esperanto, and in my own case the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Columbia have shown their open-mindedness to the extent of engaging a paid lecturer for a prolonged course. So has the Department of Education of the city of New York. In the Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C., a considerable number of scientists have declared in favor of Esperanto, and are adepts of the language. My experience is that in this country the informed public warmly approves of Esperanto and the ideals it stands for, but expects the spread of the language to come through the schools. There is consequently in this country a special inertia in this matter, in spite of approval; this makes organised propaganda extremely difficult in such a vast territory. Accordingly the national organization, the E.A.N.A. (Esperanto Association of North America), central offices, Newton Center, Mass., has so far had but a checkered and precarious existence. A rival society, the U.S.E.A. (United States Esperanto Association) has its headquarters at Shaller, Iowa. If I were asked how Esperanto could best be introduced into the schools, I should suggest that a limited course of lecture lessons, say, from to 2, to the teachers would suffice to give them all that is necessary to enable them to practice the language until complete proficiency is attained. In many places there is even now a supply of local Esperantists ready to cooperate with the schools. After a month's study any teacher should be able to teach others and perfect himself in the process. At that I would teach the language only to the pupils in their last year of school; many of them could make immediate use of Esperanto on entering business; most of them would probably get enough of the language during the last session at school to engage them to keep up the practice afterwards according to local opportunities. Please do not judge of this probability by your experience with other languages, which most students drop as soon as possible. Their endless complications make the study and practice irksome and futile, while Esperanto is positively fascinating. In my opinion two lessons of 5/8 minutes a week would amply suffice to secure practical results never dreamed of in the French, German, or Spanish classes. After a very short course of study, the boys and girls would get an opportunity to correspond with scholars of their own age and station in many lands. There are even now hundreds of school boys and girls in France, Germany, Austria, Spain, and even in China and Japan eager for such interchange of thoughts by means of Esperanto. The hour or hour and a half spent weekly on this subject would be amply repaid by the increased intelligence and linguistic feeling of the pupils, and ultimately the subject could be taught with great benefit to the whole school, doing away with the necessity of ineffectual attempts at teaching foreign languages to all and sundry, regardless of taste and capacity. Perhaps a few remarks may be in place here to substantiate still more clearly the postulate that Esperanto fulfills absolutely the ideal requirement of a language that means to be introduced throughout the world as a secondary or auxiliary language: Facility of acquirement to all nations. There is not one difficult sound, such as our th, our obscure vowels, the French nasals, the German a, o, u, etc. The vowels are a, e, i, o, and u. Each has but one sound value, and that long and full, approximately as in the phrase: 'Pa may we go, too?' The tonic accent, an insuperable difficulty in English, on account of its irregularity and elusiveness, is in Esperanto invariably on the last vowel but one. The grammar is reduced to a minimum, the whole mechanism of Esperanto being compassed within 6 rules which any one can grasp and assimilate inside one hour. The vocabulary is extremely small, less than,00 roots, mostly common to every Aryan tongue, being sufficient for all ordinary purposes of language. This is due to the marvelously ingenious system of word building, which enables anyone to derive from a dozen to one hundred and more words from every root, there being to this derivation no limit but that of common sense. Of course, the vocabulary for science and technology is considerably larger, but equally flexible. There are no troublesome genders; sex is expressed by the insertion of 'in' before the 'o' ending of nouns, and of course only in the case of animate creation. For instance, 'viro' is man, 'virino' woman, 'frato' brother, 'fratino' sister, 'kuzo' male cousin, 'kuzino' female cousin, etc. And here Esperanto has over all other languages not only the signal advantage that there are no irregularities, but the far more important advantage that the scheme is applicable to all cases. For instance, although we have in English from 0 to 0 different ways of forming the feminine such as father, mother; brother, sister; uncle, aunt; bull, cow; stallion, mare; fox, vixen; etc., yet in most cases we possess no decent or sensible way to indicate the sex of the individuals; as, for instance, in the cases of teacher, doctor, friend, cousin, neighbor, witness, elephant, camel, goat, typist, stenographer, companion, president, chairman, etc. Last, but not least, every word parses itself by its distinctive ending. The stupendous flexibility of Esperanto will be still better understood if I state here that it possesses some 0 the possible rivals, past, present, or future, to Esperanto see closing remarks. To complete what I said on the verb during the hearing I give here the entire paradigm of the verb in Esperanto. Paroli, to speak; parolanta, speaking; parolata, spoken. Present, I speak, etc.: Mi parolas, vi parolas, li parolas, sxi parolas, ni parolas, vi parolas, ili parolas,,. There a thus only one ending 'as' for the present of every verb and the same for every person. In the past the ending is 'is': mi parolis, I spoke, etc. In the future 'os' mi parolos, I shall speak, etc. In the conditional 'us': mi parolus, I should speak, etc. In the subjunctive 'u': ke mi parolu, that I may or might speak, the tense being sufficiently indicated by the antecedent verb. For the imperative we use the subjunctive without conjunction and generally without subject. The participle has a most ingenious flexbility, it having three forms, anta, inta, onta for the active, and ata, ita, ota for the passive; parolanta, speaking now; parolinta, having spoken; parolonta, about to be speaking; parolata, being spoken now; parolita, spoken formerly; parolota, to be spoken later. Only practice can reveal the wonderful usefulness of this scheme, again, of course, applicable to all verbs. One interesting sequel is, that as every word can be turned into a noun--if sense demands it--by simply changing the ending into o, we therefore get: parolanto, the present speaker; parolinto, the past speaker; parolonto, the future speaker. Let no one say that such richness and possibility of precision is of no importance; many a life's jeopardy has turned on less. Nor can it be said that this unlimited capacity of expression makes the mechanism of the language cumbersome, for the whole scheme of Esperanto can be thoroughly mastered in a few hours.""","""Esperanto language promotion and education""","1705","""Esperanto, the world's most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language, holds a unique position in the realm of linguistic diversity and multicultural communication. Created by Dr. Ludwig Lazarus Zamenhof in the late 19th century with the noble vision of fostering global understanding and unity, Esperanto continues to captivate individuals worldwide with its simplicity, regular grammar, and inclusive ethos. Despite facing challenges in gaining mainstream recognition, the promotion and education of Esperanto remain vital endeavors that contribute to linguistic pluralism, intercultural dialogue, and cognitive benefits for learners.  Promoting Esperanto involves a multifaceted approach that leverages the language's inherent strengths and values. Advocates of Esperanto emphasize its neutrality, as it lacks cultural or national biases, making it an ideal medium for intercultural communication. The language's grammar, based on logical rules and suffixes that denote word function, offers a structured yet flexible framework that facilitates rapid learning and proficiency. Additionally, Esperanto's phonetic spelling and straightforward pronunciation make it accessible to speakers of various language backgrounds, removing barriers to communication and enabling inclusive interactions.  One of the central tenets of Esperanto promotion is its role in fostering linguistic diversity and preserving minority languages. By learning Esperanto, individuals can engage with a global community of speakers who share a common interest in linguistic exploration and cultural exchange. This interconnected network encourages cross-cultural friendships, educational collaborations, and intellectual exchanges that transcend national borders and linguistic divides. Moreover, Esperanto serves as a bridge language that can enhance communication between speakers of diverse mother tongues, paving the way for meaningful dialogue and mutual understanding.  Education plays a crucial role in promoting Esperanto and nurturing a new generation of speakers. Learning Esperanto benefits learners of all ages by enhancing cognitive abilities, such as memory retention, problem-solving skills, and multilingualism. Studies have shown that learning Esperanto can improve language learning strategies, boost linguistic confidence, and provide a solid foundation for acquiring additional languages. In educational settings, incorporating Esperanto into curricula can enrich language programs, promote cultural awareness, and cultivate a sense of global citizenship among students.  To expand the reach of Esperanto education, initiatives such as language courses, workshops, online resources, and immersion programs are essential tools for engaging learners and building proficiency. Language enthusiasts, educators, and organizations dedicated to Esperanto advocacy collaborate to develop learning materials, organize events, and support educational projects that promote the language's usage and relevance in today's interconnected world. By creating opportunities for interaction, practice, and collaboration, these initiatives empower individuals to embrace Esperanto as a practical tool for intercultural communication and intellectual engagement.  In addition to formal education, informal channels like social media platforms, language exchange programs, and cultural events play a crucial role in promoting Esperanto and nurturing a sense of community among speakers. Online forums, discussion groups, and virtual meet-ups provide avenues for dialogue, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among Esperanto enthusiasts worldwide. By leveraging digital technologies and multimedia platforms, advocates of Esperanto can reach a global audience, raise awareness about the language's benefits, and inspire individuals to embark on their journey of Esperanto learning and discovery.  In conclusion, the promotion and education of Esperanto represent a concerted effort to celebrate linguistic diversity, cultivate intercultural understanding, and empower individuals to engage in meaningful cross-border communication. By embracing Esperanto as a tool for inclusive dialogue, intellectual exploration, and cultural exchange, learners and speakers can contribute to a more harmonious and interconnected global society. Through collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and a shared commitment to linguistic pluralism, the Esperanto community continues to thrive and inspire a new generation of language enthusiasts dedicated to building bridges of communication and friendship across the world.""","741"
"Grant Madison","""The Congregationalists of the seaboard were not too hospitable to these Presbyterians, and forced them to move inland in almost every case, away from the long-settled territory over which the Boston theocracy attempted to maintain its rule, and mostly to New Hampshire and Connecticut. Londonderry recalls its origin by its name and the Scotch who settled it not only introduced their manufactures into New Hampshire but brought along with them a still more valuable importation, the so-called Irish potato, which, having been taken from South America to Ireland long before, had, in this round-about way, been brought back to its own hemisphere. Other groups went to Worcester, to Pelham, to Palmer, to Andover, and to other communities in small numbers; while many others went to Maine. The total numbers, however, were very small. Massachusetts had a definite policy at this time of encouraging, if not requiring, immigrants of this sort to settle on the frontiers. They furnished less competition in this way and played a useful part in keeping off the Indians. The emigration of the Scotch and North English who had been in Ulster for a generation or two or at the most for three generations, was due to discontent with their situation there. They had built up an important manufacture of woollens and linens which has ever since been famous throughout the world; but in 698 the jealousy of rival industrialists in England led to Parliamentary legislation which crippled the industries in Ulster and threw many men out of employment. In 704 and the following years a religious persecution of these Presbyterians was also carried on. These economic and religious handicaps were so great that after a few years of patient waiting the population gave up hope, and within half a century about half of the entire number had moved to the New World. The most important stream went into the middle and southern colonies and will be traced later. This exodus was a cause of alarm in the old country as well as in the new. 'The rumour has spread like a contagious distemper,' laments an Irish letter writer in 728; 'and the worst is that it affects only Protestants, and reigns chiefly in the North'; while another laments that 'there are now seven ships at Belfast, that are carrying off about 000 passengers thither; and if we knew how to stop them, as most of them can get neither victuals nor work at home, it would be cruel to do it.' Reference will recur frequently to this immigration of Ulster Scots. At this point it is necessary to emphasize in the first place that it was little different in racial background from the preceding English settlement, both groups being definitely Nordic in their make-up. In the second place it was a valuable addition to the colonies in the quality and energy of its members. In the third place it was always small in proportion to the English element. New England in 790, regardless of numerous non-English groups, many of them of good individual quality though insignificant in total numbers, is to be considered definitely as a transplanted English population, most of which had been settled in North America so long that its habits of thought and action had become differentiated--one might say definitely American rather than English. A third source of New England settlers during this period, small in numbers but valuable in quality, is represented by the French Huguenots who arrived for the most part in the decade or two following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The Huguenot migration to America falls in two general epochs. From 5/85/85/8, when Admiral Coligny had a vision of a Protestant France in the New World, to the Revocation in 685/8 of the Edict of Nantes, the French charter of Protestant liberty, is the first epoch, during which the immigration was scattering. From 685/8 up to about 75/80 is the second epoch, when the Huguenots, fleeing from oppression and death, sought refuge in many countries. During this period their immigration to North America reached considerable proportions. Providence and Boston were points of entry for many, though more went to the Southern colonies, and to them many an American family of the present day is proud to trace its ancestry. These French Huguenots seem to have come pre-dominantly from the middle class or artisan stratum of the population with a mixture of the lesser gentry. But their energy, ability, and character earned for them an important role in their adopted country, out of proportion to their small numbers. Unlike some of the other non-English groups they did not tend to establish colonies or settlements of their own, but scattered widely and merged freely into the general population. This was the less difficult in that they came from the most Nordic parts of France and in racial composition are scarcely to be distinguished from the English. In the same way those northern and eastern counties of England, which supplied a large part of the migration to America, had, during the preceding century, received a continuous infusion of continental Huguenots to a total sometimes estimated as high as 5/80,00, who there also became by admixture and hereditary similitude indistinguishable from their neighbors. The Indian population of New England though never great was largely exterminated by war, disease, whiskey, and the breaking up of their cultural and economic background. In the century before the settlement of Plymouth, smallpox, introduced from the Spanish Main, had flickered up and down the New England coast and had so decimated the natives that only a weakened remnant remained to oppose the Whites. In contrast, in the eleventh century the Norsemen who attempted to found settlements on the New England coast had met with savage resistance from the natives, whom they called Skrellings. Intermarriage between Whites and Indians was almost unknown save in the occasional case in which a colonist was carried into captivity. The antipathy of the English settlers to the Indians was far too great to lead to the sort of miscegenation which was encouraged by the French in their part of the continent, and to which reference will be made later. In the British colonies the half-breed was looked upon as an Indian, whereas in the French colonies, as generally in all Colonial countries that had the Roman imperial tradition and the Roman Catholic religion, the half-breed was assimilated to the European group. Some of the remaining Indians along the Atlantic coast mixed with the runaway Negro slaves, but few of them contributed to the white population, and the term 'half-breed' was in general a term of contempt. It was not until within the life-time of those now living that an infusion of Indian blood became a subject of pride, particularly in Oklahoma, unless one makes exception for such isolated tales as the somewhat grotesque Pocahontas tradition in Virginia. The predominant influence of Massachusetts at the time of the Revolution is easy to understand. It possessed, to an unusual degree, unity in the various fields in which unity is most valuable to a nation--unity of race, unity of language, unity of culture, unity of religion, unity of institutions--and, more than anywhere else in the United States, its unity was attained through a long-continued, independent growth on American soil. The French and Indian menace held back the rapidly multiplying population of New England for at least a generation. The agricultural areas were carrying more population than they could support, and they were waiting for a favorable opportunity to spread out. This opportunity came in the overthrow of Montcalm at Quebec in 75/89. The Peace of Paris in 763 left the road open, and the New England population began to push north, west, and south with a vigor that was reflected in the activity of the communities at home. The succeeding half-century is correctly regarded as the golden age of New England. Its country districts were more densely populated when the first census of the United States was taken in 790 than they have been since. The decline, which will be traced in the next section, then began and decade after decade thereafter the New England towns and villages are found in a surprisingly large percentage of cases either standing still or actually declining in number of inhabitants. The history of American colonization is usually written only in terms of the additions to population. The subtractions from it may be no less important. Subtractions by migration westward were less significant because in many cases the frontier merely proliferated itself by sending its surplus out without diminishing its own standards or numbers. The first national loss of population occurred after 640 when the changing political conditions in England, and the tyranny of the Massachusetts Bay authorities, drove many people out of Massachusetts. This loss, serious as it was, is insignificant compared with the tremendous loss of superior stock at the time of the Revolution. The Loyalists made up an undetermined part of the population, perhaps as much as one-third. Those who had been most conspicuous or most active were obliged in many cases to flee, and persecution with the confiscation of their property was carried on even after the war. Most of the Loyalists who left the colonies went either to Canada or to the West Indies. Altogether the loss from this source may have been as great as 00,00 people representing on the whole a superior selection of the population. It is comparable in the racial damage done the American population with the loss which France suffered from the expulsion of the Huguenots. By the Revolution, the colonizing impulse of New England had not merely begun to fill up western New York, as will be described shortly, but had led to the formation of speculative land companies for settlement in the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania, and even on the lower Mississippi.""","""New England Settlement and Immigration""","1982","""New England Settlement and Immigration  The settlement and immigration history of New England is a rich tapestry woven with stories of courage, hardship, resilience, and cultural diversity. From the early European settlers to the waves of newcomers from various parts of the world, New England's demographic landscape has been shaped by a continuous influx of people seeking new opportunities and a better life. Let's delve into the fascinating history of New England settlement and immigration, exploring the key moments, communities, and legacies that have defined this region.  The Early Settlement: The story of New England's settlement begins in the early 17th century when English pilgrims and Puritans sought refuge from religious persecution in Europe. The Mayflower Compact of 1620 established the Plymouth Colony, marking the beginning of European colonization in the region. These early settlers faced harsh conditions, forging alliances with Native American tribes for survival. The establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 further solidified English presence in New England, leading to the founding of towns like Boston, Salem, and Plymouth.  Immigration Waves: By the 18th and 19th centuries, New England experienced significant waves of immigration, transforming its demographic makeup. Irish immigrants escaping the Great Famine of the 1840s settled in cities like Boston, contributing to the region's cultural and economic vibrancy. The Industrial Revolution fueled immigration from Italy, Portugal, and Eastern Europe, as newcomers sought employment in growing industries like textiles, manufacturing, and shipping. These diverse immigrant communities added their traditions, languages, and cuisines to the New England melting pot, enriching the region's cultural fabric.  Cultural Enclaves: Over time, distinct ethnic enclaves emerged within New England's cities, creating vibrant communities that preserved their heritage while adapting to the American way of life. Boston's North End became synonymous with Italian culture, with its narrow streets lined with trattorias and espresso bars. In Providence, Rhode Island, the Federal Hill neighborhood became a hub of Italian-American life, known for its authentic cuisine and lively festivals. Similarly, Portuguese neighborhoods in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Irish communities in South Boston showcased the resilience and tenacity of immigrant groups shaping New England's identity.  Industrial Expansion: The industrialization of New England in the 19th and early 20th centuries attracted laborers from diverse backgrounds, further diversifying the region's population. Cities like Lowell, Massachusetts, became hubs of textile manufacturing, drawing young women from rural New England as well as French-Canadian immigrants seeking employment in the mills. The growth of urban centers like Hartford, Connecticut, and Manchester, New Hampshire, offered opportunities for newcomers from Germany, Sweden, and other European countries to build new lives in the bustling industrial landscape of New England.  Challenges and Contributions: While immigration brought vitality and dynamism to New England, it also posed challenges related to assimilation, discrimination, and economic disparities. Immigrant communities faced prejudice and hostility, especially during periods of economic downturn or social unrest. However, these challenges were met with resilience and perseverance, as generations of immigrants worked hard to achieve social mobility and contribute to the prosperity of their adopted homeland. From Greek diners to Polish heritage festivals, the contributions of immigrant communities are interwoven into the fabric of New England's cultural heritage.  Legacy and Diversity: Today, New England stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of immigration and settlement. The region's cities and towns bear the imprint of its diverse residents, from colonial-era descendants to recent newcomers from around the globe. The traditions, languages, and customs brought by successive waves of immigrants continue to enrich New England's cultural landscape, creating a mosaic of identities that reflect the region's complex history. Whether it's the Greek Orthodox churches of Worcester, the Vietnamese markets of Dorchester, or the Irish pubs of South Portland, New England's diversity is a source of strength and resilience.  In conclusion, the story of New England settlement and immigration is a story of hope, struggle, and transformation. From the early English colonists to the diverse immigrant communities of today, the region's history is a testament to the enduring human spirit and the power of diversity to shape a vibrant and inclusive society. As we celebrate the cultural tapestry of New England, let us honor the contributions of all those who have made this region their home, leaving a lasting legacy of resilience, creativity, and unity in the heart of America.""","883"
"Motley John Lothrop","""The first and very faulty editions of Lorenz are religiously preserved at Harlem.] Philip died in February, 467. The details of his life and career do not belong to our purpose. The practical tendency of his government was to repress the spirit of liberty, while especial privileges, extensive in nature, but limited in time, were frequently granted to corporations. Philip, in one day, conferred thirty charters upon as many different bodies of citizens. These were, however, grants of monopoly not concessions of rights. He also fixed the number of city councils or Vroedschappen in many Netherland cities, giving them permission to present a double list of candidates for burgomasters and judges, from which he himself made the appointments. He was certainly neither a good nor great prince, but he possessed much administrative ability. His military talents were considerable, and he was successful in his wars. He was an adroit dissembler, a practical politician. He had the sense to comprehend that the power of a prince, however absolute, must depend upon the prosperity of his subjects. He taxed severely the wealth, but he protected the commerce and the manufactures of Holland and Flanders. He encouraged art, science, and literature. The brothers, John and Hubert Van Eyck, were attracted by his generosity to Bruges, where they painted many pictures. John was even a member of the duke's council. The art of oil-painting was carried to great perfection by Hubert's scholar, John of Bruges. An incredible number of painters, of greater or less merit, flourished at this epoch in the Netherlands, heralds of that great school, which, at a subsequent period, was to astonish the world with brilliant colors; profound science, startling effects, and vigorous reproductions of Nature. Authors, too, like Olivier de la Marche and Philippe de Comines, who, in the words of the latter, 'wrote, not for the amusement of brutes, and people of low degree, but for princes and other persons of quality,' these and other writers, with aims as lofty, flourished at the court of Burgundy, and were rewarded by the Duke with princely generosity. Philip remodelled and befriended the university of Louvain. He founded at Brussels the Burgundian library, which became celebrated throughout Europe. He levied largely, spent profusely, but was yet so thrifty a housekeeper, as to leave four hundred thousand crowns of gold, a vast amount in those days, besides three million marks' worth of plate and furniture, to be wasted like water in the insane career of his son. The exploits of that son require but few words of illustration. Hardly a chapter of European history or romance is more familiar to the world than the one which records the meteoric course of Charles the Bold. The propriety of his title was never doubtful. No prince was ever bolder, but it is certain that no quality could be less desirable, at that particular moment in the history of his house. It was not the quality to confirm a usurping family in its ill-gotten possessions. Renewed aggressions upon the rights of others justified retaliation and invited attack. Justice, prudence, firmness, wisdom of internal administration were desirable in the son of Philip and the rival of Louis. These attributes the gladiator lacked entirely. His career might have been a brilliant one in the old days of chivalry. His image might have appeared as imposing as the romantic forms of Baldwin Bras de Fer or Godfrey of Bouillon, had he not been misplaced in history. Nevertheless, he imagined himself governed by a profound policy. He had one dominant idea, to make Burgundy a kingdom. From the moment when, with almost the first standing army known to history, and with coffers well filled by his cautious father's economy, he threw himself into the lists against the crafty Louis, down to the day when he was found dead, naked, deserted, and with his face frozen into a pool of blood and water, he faithfully pursued this thought. His ducal cap was to be exchanged for a kingly crown, while all the provinces which lay beneath the Mediterranean and the North Sea, and between France and Germany, were to be united under his sceptre. The Netherlands, with their wealth, had been already appropriated, and their freedom crushed. Another land of liberty remained; physically, the reverse of Holland, but stamped with the same courageous nationality, the same ardent love of human rights. Switzerland was to be conquered. Her eternal battlements of ice and granite were to constitute the great bulwark of his realm. The world knows well the result of the struggle between the lord of so many duchies and earldoms, and the Alpine mountaineers. With all his boldness, Charles was but an indifferent soldier. His only merit was physical courage. He imagined himself a consummate commander, and, in conversation with his jester, was fond of comparing himself to Hannibal. 'We are getting well Hannibalized to-day, my lord,' said the bitter fool, as they rode off together from the disastrous defeat of Gransen. Well 'Hannibalized' he was, too, at Gransen, at Murten, and at Nancy. He followed in the track of his prototype only to the base of the mountains. As a conqueror, he was signally unsuccessful; as a politician, he could out-wit none but himself; it was only as a tyrant within his own ground, that he could sustain the character which he chose to enact. He lost the crown, which he might have secured, because he thought the emperor's son unworthy the heiress of Burgundy; and yet, after his father's death, her marriage with that very Maximilian alone secured the possession of her paternal inheritance. Unsuccessful in schemes of conquest, and in political intrigue, as an oppressor of the Netherlands, he nearly carried out his plans. Those provinces he regarded merely as a bank to draw upon. His immediate intercourse with the country was confined to the extortion of vast requests. These were granted with ever-increasing reluctance, by the estates. The new taxes and excises, which the sanguinary extravagance of the duke rendered necessary, could seldom be collected in the various cities without tumults, sedition, and bloodshed. Few princes were ever a greater curse to the people whom they were allowed to hold as property. He nearly succeeded in establishing a centralized despotism upon the ruins of the provincial institutions. His sudden death alone deferred the catastrophe. His removal of the supreme court of Holland from the Hague to Mechlin, and his maintenance of a standing army, were the two great measures by which he prostrated the Netherlands. The tribunal had been remodelled by his father; the expanded authority which Philip had given to a bench of judges dependent upon himself, was an infraction of the rights of Holland. The court, however, still held its sessions in the country; and the sacred privilege--de non evocando--the right of every Hollander to be tried in his own land, was, at least, retained. Charles threw off the mask; he proclaimed that this council--composed of his creatures, holding office at his pleasure--should have supreme jurisdiction over all the charters of the provinces; that it was to follow his person, and derive all authority from his will. The usual seat of the court he transferred to Mechlin. It will be seen, in the sequel, that the attempt, under Philip the Second, to enforce its supreme authority was a collateral cause of the great revolution of the Netherlands. Charles, like his father, administered the country by stadholders. From the condition of flourishing self-ruled little republics, which they had, for a moment, almost attained, they became departments of an ill- assorted, ill-conditioned, ill-governed realm, which was neither commonwealth nor empire, neither kingdom nor duchy; and which had no homogeneousness of population, no affection between ruler and people, small sympathies of lineage or of language. His triumphs were but few, his fall ignominious. His father's treasure was squandered, the curse of a standing army fixed upon his people, the trade and manufactures of the country paralyzed by his extortions, and he accomplished nothing. He lost his life in the forty-fourth year of his age (477), leaving all the provinces, duchies, and lordships, which formed the miscellaneous realm of Burgundy, to his only child, the Lady Mary. Thus already the countries which Philip had wrested from the feeble hand of Jacqueline, had fallen to another female. Philip's own granddaughter, as young, fair, and unprotected as Jacqueline, was now sole mistress of those broad domains. VIII. A crisis, both for Burgundy and the Netherlands, succeeds. Within the provinces there is an elastic rebound, as soon as the pressure is removed from them by the tyrant's death. A sudden spasm of liberty gives the whole people gigantic strength. In an instant they recover all, and more than all, the rights which they had lost. The cities of Holland, Flanders, and other provinces call a convention at Ghent. Laying aside their musty feuds, men of all parties-Hooks and Kabbeljaws, patricians and people, move forward in phalanx to recover their national constitutions. On the other hand, Louis the Eleventh seizes Burgundy, claiming the territory for his crown, the heiress for his son. The situation is critical for the Lady Mary. As usual in such cases, appeals are made to the faithful commons. A prodigality of oaths and pledges is showered upon the people, that their loyalty may be refreshed and grow green. The congress meets at Ghent. The Lady Mary professes much, but she will keep her vow. The deputies are called upon to rally the country around the duchess, and to resist the fraud and force of Louis. The congress is willing to maintain the cause of its young mistress.""","""Burgundy and Netherlands political history""","2070","""Burgundy and the Netherlands have rich and intertwined political histories that have significantly shaped the development of Europe. The Burgundian Netherlands, a territory ruled by the Dukes of Burgundy, was a crucial political entity in the late Middle Ages and early modern period. This region encompassed parts of present-day Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France, playing a key role in European geopolitics. The union of these lands under the House of Burgundy led to a unique blend of cultures and influences, leaving a lasting impact on the political landscape of the region.  The rise of the Burgundian dynasty can be traced back to the 15th century when Philip the Good, the Duke of Burgundy, expanded his territories through strategic marriages, inheritances, and military conquests. Under his rule, the Burgundian Netherlands flourished economically, culturally, and politically. The Burgundian dukes promoted trade and commerce, establishing prosperous urban centers such as Bruges, Ghent, and Brussels. These cities became hubs of artistic and intellectual activity, attracting scholars, artists, and merchants from across Europe.  However, the Burgundian Netherlands faced internal challenges due to its diverse population, comprising Dutch, Walloons, and Flemish people with distinct linguistic and cultural identities. The imposition of centralizing policies by the Burgundian rulers led to tensions and occasional revolts among the local nobility and urban elites. Despite these internal divisions, the Burgundian Netherlands remained a powerful and influential entity in European affairs.  The political landscape of the region underwent significant changes with the decline of the Burgundian dynasty in the late 15th century. The death of Charles the Bold at the Battle of Nancy in 1477 marked the end of Burgundian territorial unity. The Burgundian inheritance was divided between the Habsburgs, who gained control over the Low Countries, and the French crown, which absorbed Burgundy proper. This division set the stage for the subsequent power struggles and conflicts that would shape the political history of the region.  The Habsburg Netherlands, comprising the territories controlled by the Habsburg monarchs, including Spain and Austria, faced challenges of their own. The Spanish Habsburgs, in particular, struggled to maintain control over the Dutch provinces due to religious, economic, and political tensions. The Dutch Revolt, also known as the Eighty Years' War, erupted in the late 16th century as the Dutch provinces rebelled against Spanish rule, seeking independence and religious freedom.  Led by figures such as William of Orange, the Dutch rebels waged a protracted struggle against the Spanish forces, culminating in the establishment of the Dutch Republic in 1588. The Republic of the Seven United Netherlands emerged as a bastion of political innovation, religious tolerance, and economic prosperity. Amsterdam, in particular, became a vibrant center of trade and finance, exerting significant influence on European commerce and culture.  The political landscape of the Netherlands continued to evolve in the following centuries, with power shifting between various European powers and internal factions. The Dutch Republic's Golden Age in the 17th century saw the flourishing of Dutch art, science, and trade, making it a prominent player on the world stage. However, internal divisions, external pressures, and economic challenges eventually led to the decline of Dutch power in the 18th century.  The Congress of Vienna in 1815 marked a turning point in the political history of the Netherlands, as the country was united with the Southern Netherlands (modern-day Belgium) under the rule of the House of Orange-Nassau. The Kingdom of the Netherlands was established, encompassing a territory that reflected the complex linguistic and cultural diversity of the region. The 19th century saw the consolidation of Dutch national identity, the expansion of industrialization, and the emergence of constitutional monarchy.  The 20th century brought further challenges and transformations to the political landscape of the Netherlands, marked by two world wars, decolonization, and the process of European integration. The Netherlands emerged as a prosperous and progressive democracy, known for its commitment to social welfare, human rights, and environmental sustainability. Today, the Netherlands stands as a leading European nation, with a rich cultural heritage, strong democratic institutions, and active participation in international affairs.  In conclusion, the intertwined political histories of Burgundy and the Netherlands have shaped the course of European history, influencing developments in art, trade, governance, and diplomacy. The legacy of the Burgundian Netherlands lives on in the vibrant cultures and resilient democracies of Belgium and the Netherlands, showcasing the enduring impact of historical legacies on contemporary societies.""","927"
"Cooper A  Ambrose ","""The first is, to prevent the Loss the Distiller would incur without that Precaution, and so prevent any Alteration in the Liquor procured by Distillation. This we shall illustrate by an Example. Suppose a Distiller should attempt to rectify Spirits of Wine, without putting Water in the Alembic. It is evident, that the Fire will consume Part of it, which is entirely loss, because the same Quantity of Spirit cannot be procured from it, which might, had there been any thing to moderate the Action of the Fire, which now preyed upon it. Secondly, If Liquors are impregnated with strong Ingredients, especially Seeds, and the Quantity be sufficient to absorb all the Phlegm, a great Quantity of Spirit must be left in the Still, or the Ingredients will burn, and the Spirits contract an empyreumatic Taste, which is the more detrimental to the Spirit, as it is increased by Age. Thirdly, If no Water be put into the Alembic with the Ingredients, the Spirit will be rendered finer by them, and the Fire, if ever so little too strong, will cause the Ingredients to burn, and the Spirits to contract an Empyreuma; a Misfortune easily prevented by this Precaution. Thus it is a Safe-guard against Accidents: But besides, Water being mixed with the Ingredients, they are at once prevented from burning, and the Spirit not weakened; for no sooner are the Ingredients put in Motion by the Fire, than the Spirits immediately ascend, and the Liquor loses nothing of its Quality, provided the Receiver be removed as soon as the Phlegm begins to ascend. The Water therefore prevents the Waste of the Spirits, and thus the Distiller loses nothing of his Goods; whereas, without Water, the Spirits by impregnating the Materials, their Quantity must be less. With regard to the Phlegm, there is no Difficulty in finding when it begins to ascend, the first Drop being cloudy, and when it has continued dropping for some time, it is perceived by a milky Cast at the Bottom of the Receiver. Lastly, The Distiller is no Loser with regard to the Quality of his Liquor, which is not at all weakened thereby. Thus it is attended with the two capital Advantages, the Profit of the Distiller, and the Perfection of the Liquor. Let us now proceed to the different Manners of Distillation. CHAP. XI. Of the particular Advantages attending every kind of Distillation. In the third Chapter we mentioned the several kinds of Distillation, we shall here enlarge on the particular Advantages of each, and in what Circumstances each is to be used. In order for Distillation, the Alembic must be charged with Materials, and placed on a Fire, or Substances capable of producing the same Effect. The Method of Distilling with the common refrigerant Alembic. This Method of Distilling is the most generally used, being one of the most speedy and profitable, as it requires fewer Preparatives, and less Time. To distil with the common Alembic, the Body of it must be thoroughly cleansed, that no Taste or Smell of any preceding Materials may remain. The Materials are then to be put into the Alembic; but care must be taken that the Alembic be not above half full, in order that the Materials may have sufficient Room to move, without choaking the Neck of the Alembic. The same Care must be taken with regard to the Head, it must be thoroughly cleansed and dried; for it often happens that some small Quantity of Water is left in the Rim, which renders the first Spirits foul, and, by endeavouring to separate it from the other, some, and that the most volatile Part of the Spirit, will be lost. After this the two Parts of the Alembic are to be carefully luted with strong brown Paper, well pasted on, and the Nose of the Alembic luted to the Worm; after which the Fire should be immediately made under the Still, lest too long an Infusion should prejudice the Liquor. This Alembic being worked on an open Fire, the Operation is quicker than any other; but the Degree of Fire requires a very close Attention; as a different Management is necessary to different Materials. The Water of the Refrigeratory must be changed from time to time, and if the Case requires it, the whole Head, but especially the Bec, must be kept cold. Of Distillation in Sand, and in what Cases it should be used. This Species of Distillation is performed in two different Manners. First, by covering the Fire with Sand or Ashes, and placing the Alembic upon it. This Method is very necessary in Digestion, and for the perfect Rectification of Spirits. Sand is absolutely necessary for moderating the Action of the Fire, when there is Reason to fear the Matter contained in the Bottom of the Alembic will burn. The second Method of Sand Distillation, is to take the finest River Sand, and after thoroughly washing it, put into the Alembic a Quantity sufficient to cover it three Fingers deep; after which the Still is to be charged with the Ingredients to be distilled. This serves instead of Water in certain Cases, where the Use of it would prejudice the Ingredients; as in the fine spirituous Waters impregnated with the aromatic Parts of Flowers; the Sand preventing the Ingredients from burning. It is also necessary in distilling rectified Spirits from Seeds. This Operation being finished, the Alembic must be thoroughly cleansed from the Sand, that the Taste or Smell contained therein, be not communicated to any other Charge of different Ingredients. Of Distilling in Balneum Mari, and its Advantages. This Method of Distillation is of great Use in several Cases. Its Operation is more perfect, and is subject to few, if any of those Accidents attending Distillations on an open Fire. In distilling sweet-scented Waters from Flowers, aromatic Plants, and others of that kind, where neither Water, nor Spirit ought to be mixed with them, there is an absolute Necessity for using the Balneum Mari; as by every other Distillation, on an open Fire, the Ingredients would infallibly burn. If Sand should be made use of, the Fire would melt the Tin from the Alembic, and the Contents be in the utmost Danger of being burnt. In distilling in Balneum Mari, a glass Alembic is generally used. This Alembic is to be placed in a Copper Vessel filled with Water. This Vessel ought at least to be of half the Height of the Alembic: at the Bottom of the Copper Vessel must be a Trivet on which the Alembic is to be placed, that it may not touch the Bottom of the Copper, because when the Water begins to boil, it disperses itself towards the Sides, and leaving the Bottom dry, the Ingredients would be in danger of burning. The Use of the Balneum Mari is excellent for those Ingredients which require little Spirit; but if a Copper Alembic be used, be sure to place Sand at the Bottom, that the distilled Liquor may not contract any ill Taste or Smell. This Method is also adviseable in the Rectification of Spirits, on Account of the Danger attending this Operation when performed on a naked Fire. Were this Method of Distillation as expeditious as that performed on a naked Fire, no other ought to be used, because it is subject to no Accidents, and at the same Time the Spirit, &c. distilled is much more fragrant and grateful. In what Cases glass, or earthen Alembics are to be used; their Advantages and Disadvantages. In the Chapter relating to Accidents, we have mentioned the earthen Alembic; we must now add, that it ought never to be used, except the Matter to be distilled have a strong and bad Smell, and then seldom above once, unless it be for Ingredients of the same or similar Qualities. This Alembic being very difficult to be managed, we can only recommend it in the Case above-mentioned. As a naked Fire is generally applied to this Alembic, it requires a Furnace where the Fire may be gradually increased, on account of the Accidents to which it is liable. The glass Alembic is more easily managed, as it is generally placed in a Balneum Mari. Its principal Use is for distilling Waters from Flowers, and making Quintessences; and were it not for the Length of the Operation, it would be preferable to any other Method. This Alembic hardly admitting of a Refrigerant, a wet linen Cloth must be placed on the Head, and often changed. The Receiver of this Alembic must not be very large, because of the Fragility of the Bec; but if it were ever so little bent into a Curve, the Largeness of the Receiver would be of no Prejudice; because then its whole Weight would be supported by its Stand. Advantages of Distillation performed by the Vapour Bath. This Method differs very little from the Balneum Mari, and is used nearly in the same Circumstances; but has greatly the Advantage of the Balneum Mari in the Quickness of the Operation. And Lemery, in the first Part of his Course of Chemistry, affirms its Operation to be more perfect. However that be, its Use is equal to that of the Balneum Mari; but in distilling sweet-scented Waters, or Flowers, Sand must be placed at the Bottom, that the Liquor may not contract a Taste from the Copper. Cases where Dung, Husks of Grapes, and Lime, are to be used. These Substances are rarely used except in Digestions; and therefore of no great Use to Distillers, they using only hot Ashes, or a Fire well covered for that Purpose. If Dung be used it must be of the hottest kind, viz. that of the Horse or Sheep, and the Quantity proportioned to the Heat intended. The Lime must be quick; and if the Heat required be moderate, Lime which has lain some time in the Air must be used. The same is to be observed with regard to the Husks of Grapes. But in whatever manner these are used, the Digestions must be performed in a close covered Vessel. CHAP. XII. Of Bodies proper for Distillation. This Chapter alone might make a Volume, were we to make a particular Enumeration of all its Parts; but, as we have already observed, we shall confine ourselves to the Distillation of simple and compound Waters, &c.""","""Distillation methods and precautions.""","2216","""Distillation is a widely used separation technique that plays a crucial role in various industries such as pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, food and beverage, and more. It is a process that involves the separation of components based on their differences in boiling points. By taking advantage of these differences, distillation allows for the isolation of pure components from complex mixtures. There are several distillation methods employed to achieve this, each with its unique applications and considerations. Additionally, ensuring safety measures and precautions are vital during distillation processes to prevent accidents and ensure efficiency in the operation.  The most common distillation methods include simple distillation, fractional distillation, steam distillation, vacuum distillation, and molecular distillation. Each of these methods is suited for different scenarios depending on factors such as the properties of the components to be separated, the desired purity level, and the efficiency of the process.  Simple distillation is often used when the difference in boiling points between the components is significant. It is a straightforward process where a liquid mixture is heated, and the component with the lower boiling point vaporizes first, allowing for separation. This method is useful for separating volatile compounds from non-volatile ones, such as purifying water or isolating essential oils.  Fractional distillation is employed when the boiling point difference between the components is less pronounced. It involves the use of a fractionating column to increase the number of theoretical plates for better separation. Fractional distillation is commonly used in the petroleum industry for the separation of crude oil into its various fractions like gasoline, diesel, and kerosene.  Steam distillation is particularly useful for isolating heat-sensitive compounds, such as essential oils from plants. In this method, steam is passed through the plant material, carrying the volatile compounds with it. The steam is then condensed, resulting in a mixture of essential oil and water, which can be separated due to their immiscibility.  Vacuum distillation is employed when distilling under reduced pressure is necessary to prevent the decomposition of heat-sensitive compounds at high temperatures. By lowering the pressure, the boiling points of the components are reduced, allowing for separation at lower temperatures. Vacuum distillation is commonly used in the production of beverages like whiskey and in the purification of high-boiling-point compounds.  Molecular distillation is a specialized form of distillation used for the separation of compounds with high boiling points or those that are thermally sensitive. It operates under high vacuum conditions, where the distance between the evaporator and the condenser is minimized to reduce the travel time of the vapor, resulting in efficient separation.  When performing distillation, several precautions must be taken to ensure the safety of the process and the operators involved. Firstly, proper equipment selection is imperative. Using high-quality glassware or corrosion-resistant metals is essential to prevent breaks or leaks, which can lead to accidents or contamination of the distillate.  Additionally, maintaining a clean and clutter-free workspace is crucial to prevent accidents caused by spills or misplaced items. Proper ventilation is also necessary to prevent the buildup of volatile vapors, which could be hazardous to health or combustible.  Safety gear such as protective eyewear, gloves, and lab coats should always be worn when working with hot materials or chemicals to prevent burns or skin irritation. In the case of steam distillation, handling hot steam requires extra precautions to prevent burns.  Monitoring the distillation process closely is vital to prevent overheating or boil-over, which can result in equipment damage or loss of product. Moreover, ensuring a stable and controlled heating source is essential to maintain consistent temperatures throughout the process.  Proper labeling of all containers and materials used in the distillation process is necessary to avoid confusion and accidental mixing of chemicals. Clear labeling also helps in tracking the components being distilled and the stages of the process.  Regular maintenance and calibration of distillation equipment are important to ensure accurate results and prevent breakdowns during operation. Any signs of wear or damage should be addressed promptly to prevent accidents and maintain efficiency in the distillation process.  In conclusion, distillation is a powerful technique for separating components based on their boiling point differences, with various methods available depending on the specific requirements of the separation. By understanding the principles behind each distillation method and following safety precautions diligently, operators can perform distillation processes efficiently and safely. Adhering to best practices in equipment handling, workspace organization, safety protocols, and maintenance procedures is essential for successful distillation operations across different industries.""","889"
"Knight Charles","""But it would do more. It would have its population increasing with the increase of those productions; and that population employed in those labours alone which could not be carried on without that great power of man by which he subdues all other power to his use,--his reason. But it is not only science which has determined, and is more and more determining, the condition of the great body of operatives, but the organization of industry upon the factory principle, so universal and so powerful, has rendered it impossible for the future that the larger amount of the labour of a country should be regarded as an insulated force. It must work in conjunction with higher and more powerful forces. In France, which, as a commercial and manufacturing country, was considerably behind the advance of England, it was a common practice, in many villages and small towns, not very long ago, for the weavers to make the looms and other implements of their trade. In the fifteenth century, in the same country, before an apprentice could be admitted to the privilege of a master-weaver, it was not only necessary for him to prove that he understood his trade as a weaver, but that he was able to construct all the machines and tools with which he carried on his craft. Those who know anything of the business of weaving will very readily come to the conclusion that the apprentice of the fifteenth century, whose skill was put to such a proof, was both an indifferent weaver and an indifferent mechanician;--that in the attempt to unite two such opposite trades, he must have excelled in neither;--and that in fact the regulation was one of those monstrous violations of the freedom of industry, which our ancestors chose to devise for the support of industry. Carrying the principle of a division of labour to the other extreme point, we have seen that a vast number of persons are engaged in the manufacture of a piece of cloth, who, if individually set to carry the workmanship of that piece of cloth through all its stages, would be utterly incompetent to produce it at all, much less to produce it as durable and beautiful as the cloth which we all daily consume. How would the sorter of the wool, for example, know how to perform the business of the scourer, or of the dyer, or of the carder? or the carder that of the spinner or the weaver? or the weaver that of the miller, or boiler, or dyer, or brusher, or cutter, or presser? We must be quite sure that, if any arbitrary power or regulation, such as compelled the weaver of the fifteenth century to make his own loom, were, on the other hand, to compel a man engaged in any one branch of the manufacture of woollen cloth to carry that manufacture through all its stages, the production of cloth would be utterly suspended; and that the workmen being incompetent to go on, the wages of the workmen could no longer be paid;--for the wages of labour are paid by the consumer of the produce of labour, and here there would be nothing to consume. The great principle, therefore, which keeps the division of labour in full activity is, that the principle is necessary to production upon a scale that will maintain the number of labourers engaged in working in the cheapest, because most economical manner, through the application of that mode of working. The labourers, even if the principle were injurious to their individual prosperity and happiness, which we think it is not, could not dispense with the principle, because it is essential to economical production; and if dear production were to take the place of economical production, there would be a proportionately diminished demand for products, and a proportionate diminution of the number of producers. The same laws of necessity which render it impossible for the working men to contend against the operation of the division of labour,--even if it were desirable that they should contend against it, as far as their individual interests are concerned,--render it equally impossible that they should contend against the operation of accumulation of knowledge in the direction of their labour. The mode in which accumulation of knowledge influences the direction of their labour is, that it furnishes mechanical and chemical aids to the capitalist for carrying on the business of production. The abandonment of those mechanical and chemical aids would suspend production, and not in the slightest degree increase, but greatly diminish, and ultimately destroy, the power of manual labour, seeking to work without those mechanical and chemical aids. The abandonment of the division of labour would work the same effects. There would be incomparably less produced on all sides; and the workmen on all sides, experiencing in their fullest extent the evils which result from diminished production, would all fall back in their condition, and day by day have less command of the necessaries and comforts of life, till they sank into utter destitution. We dwell principally on the effects of accumulation of knowledge and division of labour on the working man as a consumer, because it is the more immediate object of this volume to consider such questions with reference to production. But the condition of the working man as a producer is, taking the average of all ranks of producers, greatly advanced by the direction which capital gives to labour, by calling in accumulation of knowledge and division of labour. If the freedom of labour were not established upon the same imperishable basis as the security of property, we might, indeed, think that it was a pitiable thing for a man to labour through life at one occupation, and believe that it was debasing to the human intellect and morals to make for ever the eye of a needle, or raise a nap upon woollen cloth. The Hindoos, when they instituted their castes, which compelled a man to follow, without a possibility of emerging from it, the trade of his fathers, saw the general advantage of the division of labour; but they destroyed the principle which could make it endurable to the individual. They destroyed the Freedom of Industry. 'To limit industry or genius, and narrow the field of individual exertion by any artificial means, is an injury to human nature of the same kind as that brought on by a community of possessions. Where there is no stimulus to industry, things are worst; where industry is circumscribed, they cannot prosper; and are then only in a healthy state, when every avenue to personal advantage is open to every talent and disposition. A state of equality is an instance of the first case; the division of the people into castes, as among the Ancient Egyptians, and still among the Hindoos, of the second. This division has been considered by all intelligent travellers as one powerful cause of the stationary character of the inhabitants of that country: and the effect would have been still more pernicious, if time or necessity had not introduced some relaxation into the rigorous restrictions originally established, and so ancient as to be attributed to Siva. As long, however, as the rule is generally adhered to, that a man of a lower class is restricted from the business of a higher class, so long, we may safely predict, India will continue what it is in point of civilization. An approach to the same effect may be witnessed in the limitation of honours, privileges, and immunities in some countries of Europe.' In those manufactures and trades where the division of labour is carried to the greatest extent, such as the cotton and silk trades, workmen readily change from one branch to the other, without molestation, and without any great difficulty of adapting themselves to a new occupation. The simpler the process in which a workman has been engaged--and every process is rendered more simple by the division of labour--the easier the transition: and the principal quality which is required to make the transition is, that stock of general knowledge which the division of labour enables a man to attain: and which, in point of fact, is attained in much higher perfection in a large manufactory, than in that rude state where one man is more or less compelled to do everything for his body, and therefore has no leisure to do anything for his mind. There are evils, undoubtedly, in carrying the division of labour to an extreme point; but we think that those very evils correct themselves, because they destroy the great object of the principle, and give imperfect instead of perfect production. The moral evils which some have dreaded may assuredly be corrected by general education, and in fact are corrected by the union of numbers in one employment. What sharpens the intellect ought, undoubtedly, to elevate the morals; and, indeed, it is only false knowledge which debases the morals. Knowledge and virtue, we believe, are the closest allies; and wisdom is the fruit of knowledge and virtue. The same principles as to the course which the division of labour should lead the labourer to pursue, apply to the higher occupations of industry. No man of learning has ever very greatly added to the stock of human knowledge, without devoting himself, if not exclusively, with something like an especial dedication of his time and talents, to one branch of science or literature. In the study of nature we have the mathematician, the astronomer, the chemist, the botanist, the zoologist, and the physician engaged, each in his different department. In the exposition of moral and political truths, we have the metaphysician, the theologian, the statesman, the lawyer, occupied each in his peculiar study or profession.""","""Division of labor and productivity""","1921","""Division of labor is a fundamental concept that has played a crucial role in shaping economies, industries, and societies throughout history. This concept, famously introduced by Adam Smith in his seminal work """"The Wealth of Nations,"""" refers to the specialization of tasks within a production process. By dividing the production process into smaller, more specialized tasks, individuals or groups can focus on specific aspects of production, thereby increasing efficiency and overall productivity.  One of the key advantages of division of labor is its impact on productivity. When tasks are divided among specialized workers, each individual can become highly skilled and efficient at their specific job. Specialization allows workers to develop expertise and experience in their assigned tasks, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. For example, in a manufacturing setting, dividing the production process into specialized tasks such as assembly, welding, and quality control can streamline operations and improve overall output.  Moreover, division of labor often leads to time savings. With each worker focusing on a specific task, there is less time wasted on transitioning between different tasks or reorienting oneself to new responsibilities. This results in smoother workflows, reduced downtime, and ultimately, higher productivity levels. Additionally, repetition of specialized tasks can lead to increased speed and accuracy in completing those tasks, further contributing to productivity gains.  Furthermore, the division of labor can also foster innovation and technological advancements. Specialization allows workers to hone their skills and knowledge in specific areas, enabling them to develop new techniques, processes, or technologies that can enhance productivity. As workers become more proficient in their specialized tasks, they may identify opportunities for improvement or innovation, leading to enhancements in production methods and overall efficiency.  It is important to note that while division of labor can significantly boost productivity, there are also potential drawbacks associated with this concept. One common concern is the risk of creating monotonous and repetitive work environments for workers. Performing the same task repeatedly can lead to boredom, job dissatisfaction, and decreased motivation among employees, which can ultimately impact productivity levels. To mitigate this risk, employers can consider implementing job rotation strategies or offering opportunities for skill development and career advancement to keep employees engaged and motivated.  Another challenge of division of labor is the potential for dependency within the production process. When tasks are highly specialized, the flow of production can be disrupted if one worker or group fails to perform their assigned tasks effectively. This dependency on individual roles can create vulnerabilities in the production process and pose risks to overall productivity. To address this issue, companies can implement cross-training programs or redundancy measures to ensure that operations can continue smoothly even in the absence of a specific worker or team.  In conclusion, division of labor is a powerful concept that has a profound impact on productivity in various industries and sectors. By dividing tasks among specialized workers, organizations can achieve higher levels of efficiency, time savings, and innovation in their production processes. While there are challenges associated with division of labor, such as the risk of monotony and dependency, proactive measures can be taken to mitigate these issues and maximize the benefits of specialization. Overall, a thoughtful approach to division of labor can lead to significant productivity gains and competitiveness in today's dynamic business environment.""","622"
"Lardner Dionysius","""HERO OF, 20 B. C. (.) The discovery of the fact, that a mechanical force is produced when water is evaporated by the application of heat, must be considered as the first capital step in the invention of the steam engine. It is recorded in a work entitled Spiritalia seu Pneumatica, that Hero of Alexandria contrived a machine, 20 years before the Christian era, which was moved by the mechanical force of the vapour of water. The principle of this machine admits of easy explanation: When a fluid issues from any vessel in which it is confined, that vessel suffers a force equal to that with which the fluid escapes from it, and in the opposite direction. If water issues from an orifice, a pressure is produced behind the orifice corresponding to the force with which the water escapes. If a man discharge a gun, the gases produced by the explosion of the powder issue with a certain force from the muzzle, and his shoulder is driven backwards by the recoil with a corresponding force. If the muzzle, instead of being presented forwards, were turned at right angles to the length of the gun, then, as the gases of explosion would escape sideways, the recoil would likewise take place sideways, and the shooter, instead of being driven backward, would be made to spin round as a dancer pirouettes. This was the principle of Hero's steam engine. A small globe or ball was placed on pivots at A and B (fig..), on which it was capable of revolving: steam was supplied through one of these pivots from one of the tubes D C E F, which communicated with the boiler. This steam filled the globe A I B K, and also the arms I H and K G. A lateral orifice, represented at G, near the end of these arms, allowed the steam to escape in a jet, and the reaction, producing a recoil, had a tendency to drive the arm round. A small orifice at H, on the other side of the tube, produced a like effect. In the same manner, any convenient number of arms might be provided, surrounding the globe and communicating with its interior like the spokes of a wheel. Thus these arms, having lateral orifices for the escape of the steam, all placed so that the recoil may tend to turn the globe in the same direction, a rotatory motion might be communicated to any machinery which it was desired to move. After having been allowed to slumber for nearly two thousand years, this machine has recently been revived, and engines constructed similar to it are now working in these countries. In the proper place we shall describe Avery's Rotatory Engine, which it will be seen is, not only in its principle, but almost in its details, the machine of HERO OF. Although the elastic force of steam was not reduced to numerical measure by the ancients, nor brought under control, nor applied to any useful purpose, yet it appears to have been recognised in vague and general terms. Aristotle, Seneca, and other ancient writers, accounted for earthquakes by the sudden conversion of water into steam within the earth. This change, according to them, was effected by subterranean heat. Such tremendous effects being ascribed to steam, it can scarcely be doubted that the Greeks and Romans were acquainted with the fact, that water in passing into vapour exercises considerable mechanical power. They were aware that the earthquakes, which they ascribed to this cause, exerted forces sufficiently powerful to extend the natural limits of the ocean; to overturn from their foundations the most massive monuments of human labour; to raise islands in the midst of seas; and to heave up the surface of the land of level continents so as to form lofty mountains. Such notions, however, resulted not as consequences of any exact or scientific principles, but from vague analogies derived from effects which could not fail to have been manifested in the arts, such as those which commonly occurred in the process of casting in metal the splendid statues which adorned the temples, gardens, and public places of Rome and Athens. The artisan was liable to the same accidents to which modern founders are exposed, produced by the casual presence of a little water in the mould into which the molten metal is poured. Under such circumstances, the sudden formation of steam of an extreme pressure produces, as is well known, explosions attended with destructive effects. The Grecian and Roman artisans were subject to such accidents; and the philosopher, generalising such a fact, would arrive at a solution of the grander class of phenomena of earthquakes and volcanoes. Before natural phenomena are rendered subservient to purposes of utility, they are often made to minister to the objects of superstition. The power of steam is not an exception to this rule. It is recorded in the Chronicles, that upon the banks of the Weser the ancient Teutonic gods sometimes marked their displeasure by a sort of thunderbolt, which was immediately succeeded by a cloud that filled the temple. An image of the god Busterich, which was found in some excavations, clearly explains the manner in which this prodigy was accomplished by the priests. The head of the metal god was hollow, and contained within it a pot of water: the mouth, and another hole, above the forehead, were stopped by wooden plugs; a small stove, adroitly placed in a cavity of the head under the pot, contained charcoal, which, being lighted, gradually heated the liquid contained in the head. The vapour produced from the water, having acquired sufficient pressure, forced out the wooden plugs with a loud report, and they were immediately followed by two jets of steam, which formed a dense cloud round the god, and concealed him from his astonished worshippers. Among other amusing anecdotes showing the knowledge which the ancients had of the mechanical force of steam, it is related that Anthemius, the architect of Saint Sophia, occupied a house next door to that of Zeno, between whom and Anthemius there existed a feud. To annoy his neighbour, Anthemius placed on the ground floor of his own house several close digesters, or boilers, containing water. A flexible tube proceeded from the top of each of these, which was conducted through a hole made in the wall between the houses, and which communicated with the space under the floors of the rooms in the house of Zeno. When Anthemius desired to annoy his neighbour, he lighted fires under his boilers, and the steam produced by them rushed in such quantity and with such force under Zeno's floors, that they were made to heave with all the usual symptoms of an earthquake. DE, A. D. 5/843. (.) In the year 826, M. de Navarrete published, in Zach's Astronomical Correspondence, a communication from Thomas Gonzales, Director of the royal archives of Simancas, giving an account of an experiment reported to have been made in the year 5/843, in which a vessel was propelled by a machine having the appearance of a steam engine. Blasco de Garay, a sea captain, proposed in that year to the Emperor Charles V. to propel vessels by a machine which he had invented, even in time of calm, without oars or sails. Notwithstanding the apparent improbability attending this project, the Emperor ordered the experiment to be made in the port of Barcelona, and the 7th of June, 5/843, was the day appointed for its trial. The commissioners appointed by Charles V. to attend and witness the experiment were Don Henry of Toledo, Don Pedro of Cardona, the treasurer Ravago, the vice chancellor and intendant of Catalonia, and others. The vessel on which the experiment was made was the Trinity, 00 tons burthen, which had just discharged a cargo of corn at Barcelona. Garay concealed the nature of his machinery, even from the commissioners. All that could be discovered during the trial was, that it consisted of a large boiler containing water, and that wheels were attached to each side of the vessel, by the revolution of which it was propelled. The commissioners having witnessed the experiment, made a report to the king, approving generally of the invention, particularly on account of the ease and promptitude with which the vessel could be put about by it. The treasurer Ravago, who was himself hostile to the project, reported that the machine was capable of propelling a vessel at the rate of two leagues in three hours; but the other commissioners stated that it made a league an hour at the least, and that it put the vessel about as speedily as would be accomplished with a galley worked according to the common method. Ravago reported that the machinery was too complicated and expensive, and that it was subject to the danger of the boiler bursting. After the experiment was made, Garay took away all the machinery, leaving nothing but the framing of wood in the arsenals of Barcelona. Notwithstanding the opposition of Ravago, the invention was approved, and the inventor was promoted and received a pecuniary reward, besides having all his expenses paid. From the circumstance of the nature of the machinery having been concealed, it is impossible to say in what this machine consisted; but as a boiler was used, it is probable, though not certain, that steam was the agent. There have been various machines proposed, of which a furnace and boiler form a part, and in which the agency of steam is not used. The machine of Amontons furnishes an example of this. It is most probable that the contrivance of Garay was identical with that of Hero. The low state of the arts in Spain in the sixteenth century would be incompatible with the construction of any machine requiring great precision of execution. But the simplicity of Hero's contrivance would have rendered its construction and operation quite practicable.""","""History of the steam engine""","1998","""During the Industrial Revolution, the steam engine played a pivotal role in transforming society, revolutionizing transportation, industry, and agriculture. The history of the steam engine dates back to ancient times, but it was during the 18th and 19th centuries that significant advancements were made, leading to its widespread adoption and impact on the world.  The earliest known steam-powered device was the aeolipile, a simple steam turbine invented by the ancient Greek engineer Hero of Alexandria around the 1st century AD. However, it wasn't until the 17th century that significant progress was made with the development of practical steam engines. In 1698, Thomas Savery patented the first commercially viable steam engine, known as the """"Miner's Friend,"""" which was used to pump water out of mines.  The real breakthrough came in the 18th century with the inventions of Thomas Newcomen and James Watt. Newcomen's atmospheric steam engine, patented in 1712, was the first to harness the power of steam to perform mechanical work. Watt, inspired by Newcomen's design, improved the efficiency of the steam engine by introducing a separate condenser, significantly increasing its power and fuel efficiency. Watt's innovations, patented in 1769, laid the foundation for the modern steam engine.  The steam engine's impact was felt across various industries. In mining, steam engines were used to pump water and lift ore to the surface, increasing productivity and enabling deeper mining operations. In transportation, steam engines powered locomotives, ships, and even early automobiles, revolutionizing travel and trade.  One of the most iconic applications of the steam engine was in railroads. The development of steam locomotives in the early 19th century transformed transportation, making travel faster, more reliable, and more accessible to the masses. The """"Rocket,"""" built by George Stephenson in 1829, is considered a landmark in the history of steam locomotives, showcasing the potential of steam power in revolutionizing transportation.  In the maritime industry, steam-powered ships replaced sailing vessels, making sea travel faster and more predictable. The SS Great Western, launched in 1837, was one of the first steamships to offer transatlantic service, reducing the travel time between Europe and North America significantly.  The impact of the steam engine on agriculture was no less significant. Steam-powered tractors and threshing machines revolutionized farming practices, increasing productivity and allowing farmers to cultivate larger fields more efficiently.  By the late 19th century, the steam engine had reached its peak, powering the industrial revolution and transforming society. However, advancements in internal combustion engines and electric motors eventually led to the decline of steam power in the 20th century. Today, steam engines are mostly used in heritage railways, steamships, and industrial heritage sites as a reminder of their crucial role in shaping the modern world.  In conclusion, the history of the steam engine is a testament to human ingenuity and innovation. From its humble beginnings as a simple device in ancient times to its peak during the Industrial Revolution, the steam engine changed the course of history, driving progress and shaping the world we live in today. Its legacy lives on in the form of modern technology and serves as a reminder of the power of human creativity to transform societies and industries.""","663"
"Napheys George H  George Henry ","""Hence it is well, for hygienic reasons, to consider its laws. The too frequent repetition of the reproductive act is known to be followed by consequences injurious to the general health. Too rigid continence is not unattended, in many constitutions, with danger, for the victory over passion may be dearly bought. Science recommends the adoption of a wise mean between two extremes equally destructive. By following her counsel, women may escape from the hysterical and other disorders which often wait as well upon excess as upon too great denial of that passion, which claims satisfaction as a natural right. As men have made laws upon all subjects, we need not be surprised to learn that they have legislated upon this. History informs us that the legislators of ancient times have not failed to occupy themselves with this grave question of conjugal economy. The ordinances of Solon required that the married should acquit themselves of their duties at least three times a month; those of Zoroaster prescribed once a week. Mohammed ordered that any wife neglected by her husband longer than a week could demand and obtain a divorce. It is not, however, in these, and other enactments which might be quoted, that guidance is to be sought. The principles derived from nature and experience are more valuable than human laws, however venerable; for these too often serve only to reflect the profound ignorance of their makers. Moderation should here prevail. Health is thus preserved and strengthened, and the gratification doubled. The art of seasoning pleasures in general, consists in being avaricious with them. To abstain from enjoyment, is the philosophy of the sage, the epicurism of reason. Proper self-denial in the gratification of the wants of physical love is a source of good, not only to the individual practising it, but to the community, as we shall show hereafter. It may be observed for one's own profit only, or for the benefit of another. The latter is in the end more conducive to self-interest than the former. A double advantage is derived therefrom,--gratitude and sympathy returned, and increase of appetite and of power for future enjoyment. Excess of indulgence results in the pain of surfeit and the extinction of affection. Earnest love, satisfying itself with small gratifications, is a more copious source of happiness than that frequently quenched by full gratification. What, then, is this moderation which both Hygeia and Venus command? Here, again, invariable rules are not possible. Science rarely lays down laws so inflexible as those of the Medes and Persians. She designates limits. The passage between Scylla and Charybdis is often a wide one. The folly of the ancient statutes which have been referred to, consists mainly in their failure to recognise the diverse influence of age, temperament, seasons, etc. It almost appears as if there were but one season for generation, that in which the sun re-warms and vivifies the earth, trees dress in verdure, and animals respire the soft breath of spring. Then every living thing reanimates itself. The impulse of reproduction is excited. Now, also, its gratification is most beneficial to the individual and to the species. Children conceived in the spring time have greater vitality, are less apt to die during infancy, than those conceived at any other time of the year. The statistics of many thousand cases, recently carefully collated in England, prove this beyond peradventure. It is well known that a late calf, or one born at the end of the summer, is not likely to become a well-developed and healthy animal. This has been attributed to the chilling influence of approaching winter; but it is capable of another and, perhaps, a truer explanation. Nature's impulses, therefore, in the spring of the year are for the good of the race, and may then be more frequently indulged without prejudice to the individual. Summer is the season which agrees the least with the exercise of the generative functions. The autumn months are the most unfruitful. Then, also, derangements of the economy are readily excited by marital intemperance. The temperaments exert over reproduction, as over all the other functions of the body, a powerful influence. Love is said to be the ruling passion in the sanguine temperament, as ambition is in the bilious. There is also in some cases a peculiar condition of the nervous system which impels to, or diverts from, sexual indulgence. In some women, even in moderation, it acts as a poison, being followed by headache and prostration, lasting for days. With advancing years, the fading of sexual desire calls attention to the general law, that animals and plants, when they become old, are dead to reproduction. What in early life is followed by temporary languor, in matured years is succeeded by a train of symptoms much graver and more durable. Those who are in feeble health, and particularly those who have delicate chests, ought to be sober in the gratification of love. Sexual intercourse has proved mortal after severe hmorrhages. All organized beings are powerfully affected by propagation. Animals become depressed and dejected after it. The flower which shines so brilliantly at the moment of its amours, after the consummation of that act, withers and falls. It is wise, therefore, in imparting life, to have a care not to shorten one's own existence. Nothing is more certain than that animals and plants lessen the duration of their lives by multiplied sexual enjoyments. The abuse of these pleasures produces lassitude and weakness. Beauty of feature and grace of movement are sacrificed. When the excess is long continued, it occasions spasmodic and convulsive affections, enfeeblement of the senses, particularly that of sight, deprivation of the mental functions, loss of memory, pulmonary consumption and death. One of the most eminent of living physiologists has asserted that 'development of the individual and the reproduction of the species stand in a reverse ratio to each other,' and that 'the highest degree of bodily rigor is inconsistent with more than a very modest indulgence in sexual intercourse.' The general principles we have just enunciated are of great importance in the regulation of the health. They are more suggestive and useful than the precise rules which have from time to time been laid down on this subject. WHEN BE. There are times at which marital relations are eminently improper. We are told, I Cor. vii.,, that neither husband nor wife has the power to refuse the conjugal obligation when the debt is demanded. But there are certain legitimate causes for denial by the wife. A condition of intoxication in the husband is a proper ground for refusal. Fecundation taking place while either parent has been in this state has produced idiots and epileptics. This has happened again and again. The cases on record are so numerous and well-authenticated, as to admit of no doubt in regard to the fatal effect upon the mind of the offspring of conception under such circumstances. Physical degeneracy is also often a consequence of procreation during the alcoholic intoxication of one or both parents. A peculiar arrest of growth and development of body and mind takes place, and, in some instances, the unfortunate children, although living to years of manhood, remain permanent infants, just able to stand by the side of a chair, to utter a few simple sounds, and to be amused with childish toys. During convalescence from a severe sickness, or when there is any local or constitutional disease which would be aggravated by sexual intercourse, it should be abstained from. There is reason for believing that a being procreated at a period of ill-humour, bodily indisposition, or nervous debility, may carry with it, during its whole existence, some small particles of these evils. When there exists any contagious disease, refusals are of course valid, and often a duty to the unborn. Poverty, or the wish to have no more children, can only be exceptionally allowed as a reason for the denial of all conjugal privileges. The opinion that sexual relations practised during the time of the menses engender children liable to scrofulous disease, is a mere popular prejudice. But there are other and better-founded reasons for continence during these periods. The question of intercourse during pregnancy and suckling will come up for consideration when speaking of these conditions hereafter. WHEN ARE. Nature has not designed that a function of great moment to the human race--one involving its very existence--should be attended with pain. The presence of pleasure is indicative of health, its absence of disease. But to a woman who has systematically displaced her womb by years of imprudence in conduct or dress, this act, which should be a physiological one, and free from any hurtful tendencies becomes a source of distress and even of illness. The diseases of the womb which sometimes follow matrimony are not to be traced to excessive indulgence in many cases, but to indulgence to any extent by those who have altered the natural relation of the parts before marriage. A prominent physician, Prof. T. Gaillard Thomas, of New York, has said that 'upon a woman who has enfeebled her system by habits of indulgence and luxury, pressed her uterus entirely out of its normal place, and who perhaps comes to the nuptial bed with some marked uterine disorder, the result of imprudence at menstrual epochs, sexual intercourse has a poisonous influence. The taking of food into the stomach exerts no hurtful influence on the digestive system; but the taking of food by a dyspeptic, who has abused and injured that organ, does so.'""","""Moderation in sexual health practices""","1980","""Sexual health is a pivotal aspect of overall well-being, encompassing a range of physical, emotional, and social elements. Within the realm of sexual health, the principle of moderation plays a crucial role in promoting a balanced and healthy approach to sexual practices. Understanding the significance of moderation in sexual health practices involves recognizing the importance of safety, consent, communication, and self-care.  One of the key aspects of practicing moderation in sexual health is ensuring safety. This includes using protection such as condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies. Regular testing for STIs, discussing sexual health history with partners, and being aware of one's own and partners' sexual health status are essential components of responsible sexual behavior. By adopting safe practices consistently, individuals can safeguard their own well-being and that of their partners.  Consent is another cornerstone of healthy sexual interactions. Respecting boundaries, seeking explicit consent, and communicating openly with partners are essential for maintaining a healthy and respectful sexual relationship. Understanding that consent is ongoing, freely given, enthusiastic, and specific is key to fostering a culture of mutual respect and understanding in sexual encounters. Practicing moderation in sexual health involves always prioritizing consent and ensuring that all parties involved are comfortable and enthusiastic about the sexual activity.  Moreover, communication plays a vital role in promoting moderation in sexual health practices. Open and honest discussions about desires, boundaries, and expectations with sexual partners foster a deeper connection and understanding, leading to more fulfilling and respectful sexual encounters. Effective communication helps in navigating complex topics such as sexual preferences, relationship dynamics, and sexual health concerns, ultimately contributing to a more positive and satisfying sexual experience for all parties involved.  Self-care is an integral component of practicing moderation in sexual health. This includes prioritizing mental, emotional, and physical well-being before, during, and after sexual encounters. Taking care of one's sexual health through regular check-ups, practicing self-love, setting boundaries, and seeking support when needed are fundamental aspects of maintaining a healthy relationship with oneself and one's partners. By practicing self-care, individuals can enhance their overall well-being and ensure that their sexual experiences are positive and empowering.  Embracing diversity and inclusivity is paramount in promoting moderation in sexual health practices. Recognizing and respecting the myriad ways in which individuals express their sexuality fosters a more inclusive and supportive environment for all. Celebrating sexual diversity, advocating for sexual rights, and challenging stigma and discrimination are vital steps in creating a society where everyone feels safe, valued, and empowered to make their own choices regarding their sexual health and well-being.  In conclusion, moderation in sexual health practices is about finding a balance that promotes safety, respect, communication, and self-care. By prioritizing these principles, individuals can cultivate healthy and fulfilling sexual relationships while safeguarding their own and their partners' well-being. Embracing diversity and inclusivity, respecting boundaries, and seeking consent are foundational pillars of practicing moderation in sexual health. Ultimately, by fostering a culture of moderation in sexual practices, we can create a world where sexual health is approached with understanding, empathy, and responsibility.""","618"
"Sinks Perry Wayland","""Speaking of the monks' contribution to civilization, Professor Emerton gives this estimate: 'They opened up vast tracts of land to civilized culture; they helped by their lives of self-denial to keep in the minds of men a standard of morals somewhat higher than their own; they furnished a safe retreat where the spark of learning, beaten out by the violence of the time, might find a quiet corner in which to smoulder at first, and then to flicker up slowly and feebly, yet steadily into a brilliant flame.' Similar is the witness of Professor Harding: 'Each monastery was a settlement complete in itself, surrounded by a wall; and the monks were not allowed to wander at will. New monasteries were often located on waste ground, in swamps, and in dense forests; and by reclaiming such lands and teaching better methods of agriculture the monks rendered a great service to society. Schools were also maintained in connection with the monasteries. The monks were encouraged to copy and read books.' Professor Duruy claims that 'the Benedictines added agriculture to preaching, and copying manuscripts to prayer. Schools were usually annexed to their convents, and contributed toward the saving of letters from complete ruin.' Says another: 'Only with the revival of learning did literature and art issue out to the world in general; and then the end of the reign of the manuscript was at hand. So, before the decline of monasticism was accomplished, its special work as the exclusive guardian of literature was done; and the secular world was ready to take into its own keeping the heritage of learning which the monks had been so largely instrumental in handing down to it.' And says Mr. Putnam: 'The fall of Constantinople in 45/83,' (at the very time when Gutenberg was engaged in printing the first book) 'and the introduction into Europe of the Turks, was unquestionably a great injury to Europe and to civilization, and the destruction of the collections of manuscripts existing in the capital itself and in the monasteries and libraries in other cities of the Empire, was an irreparable loss for literature. For the educational interests and the literary development of Europe there were, however, considerations to offset this serious disaster. Great as was the destruction of manuscripts, a number were preserved by individual scholars and in the hidden recesses of certain convents and monasteries. Many of these were at once taken to Italy, Germany, and France by the scholars flying from the barbarous conquerors of their land, and the works were thus brought to the knowledge and made available for the use of European students. Others were secured from their hiding places years after the capture of the City, by Greek scholars sent back for the purpose on behalf of the publishers of Italy and France, or of the universities of Bologna, Padua, and Paris, while some few valuable parchments were hidden so safely that they have been forgotten for centuries and are only to-day being brought to light from the vaults and attics of old monasteries, so as again to be included in literature accessible for the world.' The monasteries, as the tangible and permanent accretion of monasticism, then, may be justly regarded as the centers of learning and sources for the making of books--and by the slow and laborious process of hand-writing. And it was a slow and laborious process even though many copies were made at the same time from the dictation of a single reader. The monasteries became also the depositories wherein the Scriptures, together with other literature, including often the classical writings, were preserved from destruction which the vandal hordes that often devastated large sections of Europe occasioned. The larger ancient libraries, except that at Constantinople, were destroyed through the fanaticism and ruthlessness of Saracen and savage, as these forces swept across northern Africa, overran Europe, and dominated all Bible lands. But in consequence of the previous wide diffusion of books into the monasteries and religious houses of the Roman Empire and beyond--in fact, into all parts of Europe and western Asia--the destruction by vandal, savage, and Saracen was far less sweeping, undoubtedly, than these successive invasions and revolutions--these changes and upheavals in society and government--would otherwise have occasioned. While cities were sacked and burned, castles, palaces, strongholds, and many churches were pillaged and overthrown, and whole countries were laid waste, a measure of immunity from attack was accorded to these religious houses--the homes of the monks and the Orders. This immunity from attack, secured by the monasteries, was due often, and perhaps chiefly, to the fact of their secluded situations and to the strong defenses of resisting masonry which made subjection and pillage difficult and profitless. The convent of St. Catharine, where Dr. Tischendorf discovered the peerless Sinaitic Manuscript of the Bible in 85/89, is an example and illustration. This monastery was perched, as it were, on the precipitous slopes of Mt. Sinai at an altitude of full,00 feet above the level of the sea; and, until recently, the only manner of access beyond its solid, massive, and centuries-old masonry, was by means of a crude and primitive 'lift' consisting of a chair and rope, controlled by the inmates and operated by a windlass and drum within and above. By this appliance all visitors were 'elevated' some twenty or twenty-five feet from its base to the main entrance of the monastery. This arrangement safeguarded the occupants and the contents of this religious stronghold from risk of robbery and violence. These religious houses furnished even greater security by their position and isolation and were generally respected by the fiercest invaders. The safety of the monks--of peaceful occupation and mien--and of their possessions--almost wholly literary, even in the periods of disorder and violence--was often due to the supposed sacredness of the roofs under which they were sheltered. And even when these asylums were not respected but seized and plundered, the books which they treasured had little or no value in the eyes of the ignorant and hostile invaders, or were hidden away in recesses of the monasteries beyond the reach of prying eyes. And even when the manuscripts of a single monastery, or the monasteries of a given region, were all destroyed, untold numbers of copies--and largely duplicate copies--by reason of their previous extensive dispersion throughout wide areas and secluded regions, were preserved elsewhere to be again brought to light in more favored times, and, finally, at the revival of learning, which awaited the coming of the printing-press. The thirteenth century has been called 'the greatest of centuries,' and, mainly, because it was the beginning period of emergence from the 'Dark Ages' and because the hearts of men were beginning to be thrilled with the anticipatory birth-throes of the coming revival of letters. 'There is,' says Goldwin Smith, 'no more romantic period in the history of the human intellect than the thirteenth century.' The Italian renaissance in the fourteenth century brought a deepening interest for the old Latin writings, and this, in turn, revived attention to the Greek classics--the fountain-head of the world's pagan literature. The awakening concern for classic literature led the Humanists in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to ransack the libraries of the monasteries and religious houses in even out-of-the-way places of Europe for all kinds of old manuscripts. Statesmen as well as students gave themselves up to the recovering of the literary and art treasures of Greece and Rome. The Greek empire, the Levant, and all western Europe were ransacked in every nook and corner; and the treasures of the Indies and the libraries of the Levant were bought, says one, 'with impartial interest and equal delight.' This was a new and more fruitful kind of crusade, of which Symonds declares, 'As the Franks deemed themselves thrice blessed if they returned with relics from Jerusalem, so these new Knights of the Holy Ghost, seeking not the sepulchre of a risen Lord, but the tomb wherein the genius of the ancient world awaited resurrection, felt holy transport when a brown, begrimed and crabbed scrap of some Greek or Latin author rewarded their patient search.' And of Petrarch, one of the most enthusiastic searchers for these ancient writings, Myers says: 'He made many a long and wearisome journey, with the object of collecting manuscripts. The precious documents were found covered with mold in damp cellars, or loaded with dust in the attics of monasteries. This late search for these remains of classical authors saved to the world hundreds of valuable manuscripts which, a little longer neglected, would have been lost forever.' And he says, further, 'Libraries were founded where the new treasures might be stored, and copies of the manuscripts were made and distributed among all who could appreciate them.' For it was a specific outgrowth of these new intellectual and literary impulses which heralded the passing of the 'Dark Ages' that came the beginnings of the Vatican Library at Rome. This renowned library was established by Pope Nicholas V. at about the same date as the invention of printing and concurred with that invention to make effective for all time to come the revival of learning and of letters.""","""Monastic contributions to civilization and learning""","1913","""Monastic Contributions to Civilization and Learning  Monasticism, a way of life centered on religious devotion and communal living, has significantly shaped civilizations and learning throughout history. The contributions of monastic communities, both in the East and the West, have left a lasting impact on various aspects of society, including education, art, science, and social welfare. From preserving knowledge in times of turmoil to advancing technological innovations, the influence of monasticism is profound and multifaceted.  One of the primary contributions of monasticism to civilization and learning is the preservation of knowledge. During the Dark Ages in Europe, when chaos and upheaval threatened to erase the cultural achievements of antiquity, monasteries served as repositories of wisdom. Monks painstakingly copied and preserved ancient texts, including religious scriptures, philosophical works, and scientific treatises. Without their dedication to safeguarding knowledge, many priceless works would have been lost to history.  Moreover, monastic communities played a crucial role in the development of education. Monasteries were often centers of learning, where monks and scholars engaged in intellectual pursuits. Monastic schools provided education not only to novices but also to students from the surrounding communities. The emphasis on literacy and scholarship within monastic life helped cultivate a tradition of learning that laid the foundation for the educational institutions we have today.  In addition to preserving and disseminating knowledge, monastic contributions to civilization extended to the realm of art and architecture. Monasteries were instrumental in the patronage of the arts, commissioning beautiful manuscripts, intricate sculptures, and awe-inspiring architecture. The intricate illuminated manuscripts created by monks not only served as religious texts but also showcased exquisite craftsmanship and artistic skill. The stunning cathedrals and monastic buildings stand as testaments to the creativity and devotion of those who built them.  Beyond intellectual and artistic pursuits, monastic communities also made significant contributions to science and technology. Monks were often skilled in various practical disciplines, such as metallurgy, agriculture, and brewing. Their experiments and innovations in these fields not only improved the quality of life within the monastery but also contributed to advancements in broader society. Monastic gardens, for example, were centers of botanical knowledge and experimentation, leading to the cultivation of new crops and the development of herbal medicine.  Furthermore, monasticism played a vital role in promoting social welfare and compassion. Monasteries served as centers of charity, providing food, shelter, and medical care to the poor and sick. Monks and nuns actively engaged in acts of mercy and charity, embodying the teachings of humility and service. The monastic commitment to serving others and alleviating suffering inspired many to follow their example, leading to the establishment of hospitals, orphanages, and other charitable institutions.  In conclusion, the contributions of monastic communities to civilization and learning are immeasurable. Through their dedication to preserving knowledge, fostering education, promoting the arts, advancing science, and practicing compassion, monks and nuns have left an indelible mark on human history. Their legacy continues to inspire and enrich society, serving as a testament to the enduring impact of a life dedicated to faith, scholarship, and service.""","633"
"Joly John","""For this involves that there will always be some bite, however cold the ice may be. That is, the narrow strip of ice which first receives the skater's weight must partially liquefy however cold the ice. It must have happened to many here to be on ice which was too cold to skate on with comfort. The 80 skater in this case speaks of the ice as too hard. In the Engadine, the ice on the large lakes gets so cold that skaters complain of this. On the rinks, which are chiefly used there, the ice is frequently renewed by flooding with water at the close of the day. It thus never gets so very cold as on the lakes. I have been on ice in North France, which, in the early morning, was too hard to afford sufficient bite for comfort. The cause of this is easily understood from what we have been considering. We may now return to the experimental results which we obtained early in the lecture. The heavy weights slip off the ice at a low angle because just at the points of contact with the ice the latter melts, and they, in fact, slip not on ice but on water. The light weights on cold, dry ice do not lower the melting point below the temperature of the ice, i.e. below -0 C., and so they slip on dry ice. They therefore give us the true coefficient of friction of metal on ice. This subject has, more recently been investigated by H. Morphy, of Trinity College, Dublin. The refinement of a closed vessel at uniform temperature, in which the ice is formed and the experiment carried out, is introduced. Thermocouples give the temperatures, not only of the ice but of the aluminium sleigh which slips upon it under various loads. In this way we may be certain that the metal runners are truly at the temperature of the ice. I now quote from Morphy's paper 81 'The angle of friction was found to remain constant until a certain stage of the loading, when it suddenly fell to about half of its original value. It then remained constant for further increases in the load. 'These results, which confirmed those obtained previously with less satisfactory apparatus, are shown in the table below. In the first column is shown the load, i.e. the weight of sleigh weight of shot added. In the second and third columns are shown, respectively, the coefficient and angle of friction, whilst the fourth gives the temperature of the ice as determined from the galvanometer deflexions. Load. Tan y. y. Temp..8 grams..6.' -.5/8 C. 0.9 -.6 -.4 -.3 -.1 -.0 grams..7..0' 0' -.7 -.1 -.2 -.8 grams..6.' -.0 'These experiments were repeated on another occasion with the same result and similar results had been obtained with different apparatus. 'As a result of the investigation the following points are clearly shown:-- 82 ' The coefficient of friction for ice at constant temperature may have either of two constant values according to the pressure per unit surface of contact. ' For small pressures, and up to a certain well defined limit of pressure, the coefficient is fairly large, having the value.6.1 in the case investigated. ' For pressures greater than the above limit the coefficient is relatively small, having the value.7.1 in the case investigated.' It will be seen that Morphy's results are similar to those arrived at in the first experimental consideration of our subject; but from the manner in which the experiments have been carried out, they are more accurate and reliable. A great deal more might be said about skating, and the allied sports of tobogganing, sleighing, curling, ice yachting, and last, but by no means least, sliding--that unpretentious pastime of the million. Happy the boy who has nails in his boots when Jack-Frost appears in his white garment, and congeals the neighbouring pond. But I must turn away at the threshold of the humorous aspect of my pass to other and graver subjects intimately connected with skating. James Thomson pointed out that if we apply compressional stress to an ice crystal contained in a vessel 83 which also contains other ice crystals, and water at C., then the stressed crystal will melt and become water, but its counterpart or equivalent quantity of ice will reappear elsewhere in the vessel. This is, obviously, but a deduction from the principles we have been examining. The phenomenon is commonly called 'regelation.' I have already made the usual regelation experiment before you when I compressed broken ice in this mould. The result was a clear, hard and almost flawless lens of ice. Now in this operation we must figure to ourselves the pieces of ice when pressed against one another melting away where compressed, and the water produced escaping into the spaces between the fragments, and there solidifying in virtue of its temperature being below the freezing point of unstressed water. The final result is the uniform lens of ice. The same process goes on in a less perfect manner when you make--or shall I better say--when you made snowballs. We now come to theories of glacier motion; of which there are two. The one refers it mainly to regelation; the other to a real viscosity of the ice. The late J. C. M'Connel established the fact that ice possesses viscosity; that is, it will slowly yield and change its shape under long continued stresses. His observations, indeed, raise a difficulty in applying this viscosity to explain glacier motion, for he showed that an ice crystal is only viscous in a certain structural 84 direction. A complex mixture of crystals such, as we know glacier ice to be, ought, we would imagine, to display a nett or resultant rigidity. A mass of glacier ice when distorted by application of a force must, however, undergo precisely the transformations which took place in forming the lens from the fragments of ice. In fact, regelation will confer upon it all the appearance of viscosity. Let us picture to ourselves a glacier pressing its enormous mass down a Swiss valley. At any point suppose it to be hindered in its downward path by a rocky obstacle. At that point the ice turns to water just as it does beneath the skate. The cold water escapes and solidifies elsewhere. But note this, only where there is freedom from pressure. In escaping, it carries away its latent heat of liquefaction, and this we must assume, is lost to the region of ice lately under pressure. This region will, however, again warm up by conduction of heat from the surrounding ice, or by the circulation of water from the suxface. Meanwhile, the pressure at that point has been relieved. The mechanical resistance is transferred elsewhere. At this new point there is again melting and relief of pressure. In this manner the glacier may be supposed to move down. There is continual flux of conducted heat and converted latent heat, hither and thither, to and from the points of resistance. The final motion of the whole mass is necessarily slow; a few feet in the day or, in winter, 85/8 even only a few inches. And as we might expect, perfect silence attends the downward slipping of the gigantic mass. The motion is, I believe, sufficiently explained as a skating motion. The skate is, however, fixed, the ice moves. The great Aletsch Glacier collects its snows among the highest summits of the Oberland. Thence, the consolidated ice makes its way into the Rhone Valley, travelling a distance of some 0 miles. The ice now melting into the youthful Rhone fell upon the Monch, the Jungfrau or the Eiger in the days when Elizabeth ruled in England and Shakespeare lived. The ice-fall is a common sight on the glacier. In great lumps and broken pinnacles it topples over some rocky obstacle and falls shattered on to the glacier below. But a little further down the wound is healed again, and regelation has restored the smooth surface of the glacier. All such phenomena are explained on James Thomson's exposition of the behaviour of a substance which expands on passing from the liquid to the solid state. We thus have arrived at very far-reaching considerations arising out of skating and its science. The tendency for snow to accumulate on the highest regions of the Earth depends on principles which we cannot stop to consider. We know it collects above a certain level even at the Equator. We may consider, then, that but for the operation of the laws which James Thomson brought to light, and which his illustrious brother, 86 Lord Kelvin, made manifest, the uplands of the Earth could not have freed themselves of the burthen of ice. The geological history of the Earth must have been profoundly modified. The higher levels must have been depressed; the general level of the ocean relatively to the land thereby raised, and, it is even possible, that such a mean level might have been attained as would result in general submergence. During the last great glacial period, we may say the fate of the world hung on the operation of those laws which have concerned us throughout this lecture. It is believed the ice was piled up to a height of some,00 feet over the region of Scandinavia. Under the influence of the pressure and fusion at points of resistance, the accumulation was stayed, and it flowed southwards the accumulation was stayed, and it flowed southwards over Northern Europe. The Highlands of Scotland were covered with, perhaps, three or four thousand feet of ice. Ireland was covered from north to south, and mighty ice-bergs floated from our western and southern shores. The transported or erratic stones, often of great size, which are found in many parts of Ireland, are records of these long past events: events which happened before Man, as a rational being, appeared upon the Earth. 87 A AS TO A""","""Ice, Friction, and Glacier Motion""","2026","""Ice, Friction, and Glacier Motion  Glaciers are mesmerizing rivers of ice that flow slowly across the Earth's surface, shaping landscapes and carving out valleys over millions of years. Understanding the interplay between ice, friction, and glacier motion is crucial for grasping the dynamic nature of these icy behemoths and their significant impact on the environment. Let's delve into the fascinating world of glaciers and explore how ice, friction, and other factors contribute to the intricate dance of glacier motion.  Ice forms the foundational core of glaciers, comprising compacted snowflakes that have accumulated over time. Due to the immense pressure exerted by layers of accumulating snow, the lower portions of the glacier undergo a transformation, where individual snowflakes merge into a dense mass of ice. This metamorphosis results in the formation of distinct layers within the glacier, each representing a snapshot of the climatic conditions prevalent during that period. By studying these layers, known as annual rings or varves, scientists can unravel the history of the Earth's climate and glean insights into past environmental changes.  The movement of glaciers is driven by a combination of factors, with gravity playing a primary role in initiating glacier motion. As snow accumulates in mountainous regions or polar areas, the sheer weight of the overlying snowpack pushes the lower layers of ice downslope. This gravitational force propels the glacier forward, causing it to slowly flow like a viscous river of ice. The angle of the slope also influences the speed of glacier motion, with steeper inclines accelerating the flow of ice downhill.  Friction, a force that opposes motion, presents a significant obstacle to the smooth movement of glaciers. As a glacier advances, its underside comes into contact with the bedrock or underlying terrain, leading to the development of basal shear stress. This stress arises from the resistance encountered by the glacier as it slides over irregularities in the landscape, such as rocks and sediments. The interaction between the glacier and the underlying surface generates frictional forces that impede the forward progress of the glacier, exerting a braking effect on its motion.  Understanding the role of friction in glacier dynamics is essential for predicting how glaciers will respond to changes in temperature and other environmental variables. For instance, an increase in temperature can lead to the melting of the glacier's base, reducing the frictional resistance and potentially accelerating glacier flow. Conversely, a decrease in temperature may enhance basal freezing, increasing the friction between the glacier and its bed and slowing down glacier motion. These complex interactions underscore the delicate balance between external factors and internal processes that govern glacier behavior.  In addition to gravity and friction, other factors such as ice deformation, meltwater production, and glacier geometry exert a profound influence on glacier motion. Ice deformation refers to the process by which glacial ice flows and deforms under pressure, causing internal layers to stretch and compress. This internal deformation contributes to the overall flow of the glacier, with ice moving faster in the center of the glacier and slower along the margins.  Meltwater production plays a dual role in glacier motion, acting as both a lubricant and a source of additional mass. During warmer seasons, melting at the glacier's surface generates water that percolates through crevasses and moulins, reaching the glacier base. This water acts as a lubricant, reducing basal friction and facilitating faster glacier movement. However, excessive meltwater influx can also lead to the creation of subglacial channels and cavities, weakening the glacier's structural integrity and potentially triggering sudden surges in glacier speed.  The geometry of a glacier, including its width, thickness, and slope, profoundly influences its motion characteristics. Thicker glaciers tend to flow more slowly due to increased basal resistance, while narrower glaciers experience higher velocities as their mass is concentrated in a confined space. The slope of the glacier's surface also plays a critical role, with gentle slopes promoting slower flow rates and steep gradients accelerating glacier movement. These geometric factors interact with external forces such as gravity and friction to shape the overall behavior of the glacier and determine its flow dynamics.  The study of glacier motion has far-reaching implications for understanding climate change, geomorphology, and the water cycle. By monitoring the movement of glaciers worldwide, scientists can track shifts in mass balance, ice volume, and glacier extent, providing valuable insights into the impacts of global warming and other environmental stressors. Changes in glacier motion patterns can signal broader transformations in the Earth's climate system, highlighting the interconnected nature of our planet's delicate equilibrium.  In conclusion, the intricate interplay between ice, friction, and various environmental factors governs the mesmerizing motion of glaciers across the Earth's surface. From the relentless pull of gravity to the resistance of frictional forces, glaciers embody the delicate balance between opposing influences that shape our planet's landscapes. By unraveling the mechanisms driving glacier motion, we gain a deeper appreciation for the profound impact of these icy giants on our planet's past, present, and future.""","996"

I, too, pouring out of my limitless stores limitless streams of rejoicing. I, too, an equal maker and sustainer of undoubted life. I, too, smiling back order into any chaos. I, too, always merry and rejuvenescent. I who am so glad I was born. I'm so glad I was born. I like to tell about that.

Glad to be born even if born to sickness. (Though no one is born to sickness.) And gladness is forever the footway of dreams. I can go to the injustices of the world with my joy. I am not afraid that the injustices can refute my joy. For injustice never can refute justice. My jubilant rhapsodies will prevail. They will go where nothing else will go. They will go where arguments will not go and figures will not go. They will go where logic will not go and law will not go. They will go where the pride of faith will not go and the humility of faith will not go. They will go where the sun will not go and the rains will not go. I say I'm glad I was born. I am good seed for any ground. No soil could be so bad my seed is not good for it. I am good will for any life. No life could be so poor my seed is not rich for it. I am the victorious day that comes after every other day has come and failed. I am the courage that comes after every other resolution has come and failed. I am everything true that comes after everything false has come and failed. I am the conquering work of your brains and your hands that comes after all other work has come and failed. I'm so glad I was born. Glad for the universe. What luck it was to the universe the day I was born. I feel that the universe was full paid all old credits that day. I came.

I never fall short. You cant take your position in society to your heart. You cant take your overcapitalized name to your heart. You cant take your riches to your heart. Oh, you cant take your riches, all your thousands, all your houses, all your swell possessions, to your heart: and they cost you much. But you can take me to your heart, you can take my eyes that see and ears that hear to your heart, you can take my announcements of immortal life to your heart: they never default, never fall short: and they cost you nothing. I guess I have said all I can say about that. I have got so far in my raptures now I have got beyond words. You must get the rest without words. I'm so glad I was born. And so I have come to sing life: I have come to bring that which is hidden to the surface: And so I have been set apart to deal honestly with man and woman and sex and suffer for it: And so I have been chosen from all the rest as the one who can say what the rest think and desire and dare not justify: And so I declare for them: for the discredited dreams: for the obscured purposes: declare for them and invite those who are angry to take it out of me: And so I stand about where the most people are and issue my challenge and wait for the result:""","""The joy of existence and creation.""","2329","""Existence and creation are intertwined in a dance of beauty and wonder, shaping the essence of our being and the fabric of the world around us. The joy derived from both our existence and the act of creation is a profound and transformative experience that resonates deep within our souls. From the smallest act of creation to the grandeur of our existence, these elements intertwine to bring forth a sense of purpose, fulfillment, and awe.  The mere fact that we exist, that we are here in this vast universe, is in itself a miracle that fills us with wonder and gratitude. Our very being, with all its complexities and intricacies, is a testament to the beauty of existence. From the beating of our hearts to the firing of neurons in our brains, every moment we exist is a testament to the miracle of life. The joy of existence lies in the awareness that we are a part of something greater, that we are interconnected with all living beings and the universe itself.  Creativity is a manifestation of our existence, a reflection of our innermost desires, thoughts, and emotions. Whether we are painting a masterpiece, composing a symphony, writing poetry, or simply arranging flowers in a vase, the act of creation allows us to express ourselves fully and authentically. It is a channel through which we can channel our emotions, ideas, and experiences, giving them form and substance in the world.  The joy of creation stems from the act of bringing something new into being, of shaping raw materials into a work of art, a piece of music, a story, or a technological innovation. It is a process of discovery and exploration, a journey into the unknown where we can push the boundaries of our imagination and capabilities. The satisfaction that comes from creating something out of nothing, from seeing our vision come to life, is unparalleled.  In the act of creation, we tap into a wellspring of creativity that lies within each of us, waiting to be unleashed. Whether we are painting, writing, dancing, or inventing, the creative process is a deeply fulfilling and enriching experience that allows us to connect with our inner selves and the world around us. It is a way of making sense of the world, of exploring our thoughts and emotions, and of leaving a mark on the world that will outlive us.  The joy of existence and creation is not just limited to the individual experience but extends to the collective human experience as well. Throughout history, humans have come together to create magnificent works of art, literature, music, architecture, and scientific discoveries that have shaped the course of civilization. The collective act of creation is a testament to the power of human collaboration and ingenuity, showing us what is possible when we join forces to create something greater than ourselves.  At the core of both existence and creation is a sense of purpose and meaning that gives our lives direction and fulfillment. Whether we are creating art, raising a family, building a career, or simply enjoying the beauty of nature, the act of existing and creating provides us with a sense of purpose that drives us forward and gives meaning to our lives. It is through our existence and our creations that we leave a legacy for future generations, a testament to our time on this earth.  In conclusion, the joy of existence and creation is a profound and transformative experience that enriches our lives in countless ways. From the simple act of being alive to the complex process of creating something new, these elements are intertwined in a tapestry of beauty and wonder that defines the human experience. By embracing both our existence and our creative potential, we can tap into a wellspring of joy and fulfillment that will sustain us throughout our journey in this world.""","737"
"Machen J Gresham John Gresham ",""". IN At Tyre and at Csarea, Paul received warnings against visiting Jerusalem. These warnings came through the Spirit, Acts 1:,1, but not in the sense that the Holy Spirit commanded Paul not to go. The meaning is that the Spirit warned him of the dangers that were to befall him. In meeting these dangers bravely he was acting in full accordance with the divine will. At Acts 1:8 the use of the first person plural ceases, because Luke had no immediate part in the events that followed. It is natural to suppose, however, that he remained in Palestine, for he joined Paul again in Csarea, at the beginning of the journey to Rome. For the events of Paul's imprisonment in Jerusalem and in Csarea he had first-hand information. The vow in which Paul took part at the request of James was at least similar to the Nazirite vow described in Num.:-1. Not all the details of such vows are perfectly clear. Paul himself, on his own account, had assumed a similar vow on his second missionary journey, Acts 8:8--unless indeed, as is grammatically possible, the words in that passage refer to Aquila rather than to Paul. It was not true, as the Christians of Judea had been led to think, that Paul taught the Jewish Christians of the dispersion to forsake the law of Moses, though he was insistent that the Gentile Christians must not adopt that law. It was not even true that he himself had altogether given up keeping the law, though the exigencies of his Gentile work required him to give it up very often, and though he regarded himself as inwardly free from the law. His willingness to take part in a Jewish vow in Jerusalem is therefore not surprising. His action on this occasion was fully justified by the principles of his conduct as described in I Cor.:0,1. The keeping of the law was not for Paul a means of obtaining salvation. Salvation was a free gift of God, through the death of Christ. But for the present the general relinquishment of the law and abandonment of the distinctive customs of Judaism on the part of Jewish Christians was not required. Paul was willing to leave that question to the future guidance of God. It is somewhat surprising that the Book of The Acts mentions the great collection for the Jerusalem church only incidentally, in the report of a speech of Paul. Acts 4:7. The interest of Luke in this part of the narrative is absorbed in the relations between Paul and the non-Christian Jews and the Roman authorities. The internal affairs of the Church are left for the most part out of account. The Acts and the Pauline Epistles, here as so often, must be allowed to supplement each other. Luke gives a vivid picture of the external events, and a clear view of the relations of Christianity to the outside world; while Paul affords us a deeper insight, in some respects at least, into the inward development of the Church's life.. PAUL The famous reply of Agrippa to Paul, Acts 6:8, is exceedingly difficult to translate and to interpret. The translation in the Revised Version is by no means certainly correct. The words may mean, 'A little more of this persuasion will make me a Christian!' or else, 'You seem to think that the little persuasion you have used is sufficient to make me a Christian.' In any case, the sentence displays a certain perplexity on the part of the king. He certainly does not mean that he is on the point of accepting Christianity--his words have a half-ironical tone--but on the other hand his interest is aroused. The same thing is probably to be said for Festus. He said, 'Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning is turning thee mad,' but he said it with a loud voice as though he were agitated. There was something uncanny about this prisoner!. THE OF The dates of many events in the apostolic age have usually been fixed by counting from the accession of Festus. Unfortunately, however, that event itself cannot be dated with certainty. Some put it as late as A. D. 1, others as early as A. D. 5/8. If the date A. D. 0 be provisionally adopted, then Paul's arrest in Jerusalem occurred in A. D. 8, and his arrival in Rome in A. D. 1. The conclusion of the narrative in The Acts would then fall in the year A. D. 3. It will be remembered that the proconsulship of Gallio now affords an additional starting point for a chronology of the apostolic age.. OF THE After the meeting between Paul and James, which is narrated in Acts 1:7-6, the Jerusalem church, at least so far as any direct narrative is concerned, disappears from the pages of the New Testament. It will be observed that in the account of Paul's last visit, only James, the brother of the Lord, and 'the elders' are mentioned as representatives of the church. Possibly some of the twelve apostles may be included under the term 'elders,' but it is also perfectly possible that the apostles were all out of the city. James, the brother of the Lord, continued to be the head of the Jerusalem church until he was martyred--in A. D. 2, or, as others suppose, in A. D. 6. Before the war which culminated in the capture of Jerusalem in A. D. 0, the Christians of the city fled to Pella beyond the Jordan. From that time, on, though the Christians returned after the war, Jewish Christianity was quite uninfluential. The supremacy of the Jerusalem church was gone. But that church had already rendered a priceless service. It had laid the foundations of Christendom. It had sent forth the first missionaries. And it had preserved the record of Jesus' life. The Synoptic Gospels, in substance at least, are a product of the Jerusalem church. IN THE.--Purves, 'Christianity in the Apostolic Age,' pp. 60-66, 31-39.

THE OF THE With the lesson for to-day, we are introduced to the third group among the epistles of Paul. The epistles of the second group, which were written during the third missionary journey, are concerned with the problem of sin and salvation; the epistles of the third group are interesting especially for their teaching about the person of Christ and about the Church. A period of about three or four years separates the last epistle of the second group from the first epistle of the third. Most of this interval had been spent by Paul in captivity. Undoubtedly, during this period of enforced leisure, there had been development in Paul's thinking, but it is very difficult to determine exactly wherein that development consisted. The differences of the third group of epistles from the second are due to the difference in the readers at least as much as to a difference in Paul himself. It is hard to say just how much of Colossians and Ephesians Paul would have been incapable of writing during the third missionary journey. At any rate, the epistles of the captivity differ from those of the former group in being for the most part quieter in tone. During the third journey Paul had had to continue the great battles of his career against various forms of Judaizing error. Christianity at one time seemed to be in danger of being reduced to a mere form of Judaism; the free grace of God was being deserted for a law religion; faith was being deserted for works. In Galatia, the question of principle had been uppermost; in Corinth, the personal attack upon Paul. Everywhere, moreover, the gospel of salvation by faith was exposed to misconception. Pagan license was threatening to creep into the Church. Unless it could be kept out, the legalists would have some apparent show of reason on their side. Taking it all in all, it had been a hard battle. But it had been gloriously fought, and it had been won. Now Paul was able to turn his attention to new fields of labor and to new problems.. THE OF The Epistle to the Colossians is peculiarly 'Christological.' More fully and more expressly than in any other of his letters Paul here develops his view about the person of Christ. Even here, however, this teaching is incidental; it was simply Paul's way of refuting certain errors that had crept into the Colossian church. Except for those errors Paul would perhaps never have written at length, as he does in Col.:4-3, about the relation of Christ to God and to the world. Yet in that case his own views would have been the same, and they would have been just as fundamental to his whole religious life. In the epistles, which are written to Christians, Paul takes many things for granted. Some of the things which are most fundamental appear only incidentally. Just because they were fundamental, just because they were accepted by everyone, they did not need to be discussed at length. So it is especially with the person of Christ. From the first epistle to the last, Paul presupposes essentially the same view of that great subject. Practically everything that he says in Colossians could have been inferred from scattered hints in the earlier epistles. From the beginning Paul regarded Jesus Christ as a man, who had a real human life and died a real death on the cross. From the beginning, on the other hand, he separated Christ sharply from men and placed him clearly on the side of God.""","""Paul's Mission and Early Christianity""","2180","""Paul, also known as Saint Paul the Apostle, is one of the most influential figures in the history of Christianity. His mission and teachings played a pivotal role in shaping early Christianity and spreading the message of Jesus Christ. Paul's conversion from a fierce persecutor of Christians to a dedicated follower of Christ is a powerful testament to the transformative power of faith. His missionary journeys, epistles, and theological insights continue to resonate with Christians around the world today, cementing his legacy as a key architect of the early Christian Church.  Paul's early life was marked by zealotry and persecution of Christians. Born as Saul in Tarsus, a prominent city in the Roman province of Cilicia (modern-day Turkey), he was a devout Pharisee who actively persecuted early followers of Jesus. His encounter with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus, where he was temporarily blinded and heard the voice of Jesus, transformed his life and beliefs. This dramatic event led to his conversion to Christianity and set him on a new path as an apostle to the Gentiles.  Following his conversion, Paul devoted himself wholeheartedly to spreading the gospel message of Jesus Christ. He embarked on several missionary journeys throughout the eastern Mediterranean, establishing Christian communities and churches in various cities such as Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome. Paul's travels were instrumental in expanding the reach of Christianity beyond its Jewish origins and welcoming non-Jews, or Gentiles, into the faith.  One of Paul's most significant contributions to early Christianity was his letters, or epistles, written to the nascent Christian communities he founded or supported. These epistles form a substantial portion of the New Testament and provide valuable insights into Paul's theology, pastoral care, and understanding of Christian living. His letters address a wide range of topics, including theology, ethics, church governance, and eschatology, offering guidance and encouragement to believers facing various challenges.  In his theological writings, Paul elaborated on key Christian doctrines such as salvation, grace, faith, and the role of Christ in redemption. He emphasized the central importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the source of salvation and eternal life, arguing that righteousness comes through faith rather than observance of the Jewish law. Paul's teachings on grace underscored the idea that salvation is a gift from God, freely given to all who believe, regardless of their background or past actions.  Paul also played a crucial role in resolving early theological debates within the Christian community, particularly concerning the inclusion of Gentiles in the church. He advocated for a more inclusive approach, arguing that faith in Christ, rather than adherence to Jewish customs, was the defining criterion for membership in the Christian community. This stance helped shape the early Church's identity as a diverse and inclusive community of believers united by their common faith in Jesus Christ.  Despite facing numerous challenges, including persecution, imprisonment, and conflict within the church, Paul remained steadfast in his mission to spread the gospel. His enduring legacy lies not only in his theological writings and missionary efforts but also in his personal dedication to living out the principles of love, humility, and self-sacrifice that he preached to others. Paul's life exemplified the transformative power of faith and the ability of individuals to change course, embrace grace, and work tirelessly for the Kingdom of God.  In conclusion, Paul's mission and early Christianity are intertwined in a rich tapestry of faith, courage, and perseverance. His journey from persecutor to apostle reflects the radical transformation that can occur through encountering the living Christ. Through his missionary zeal, theological insights, and pastoral care, Paul left an indelible mark on the early Christian Church, shaping its beliefs, practices, and identity for centuries to come. The legacy of Saint Paul serves as an enduring inspiration for Christians to live out their faith boldly, compassionately, and faithfully in a world hungry for love, justice, and redemption.""","781"
"Morgan Lewis Henry","""This is attended with a very good effect, for by this means every living creature is properly taken care of.' I do not understand what Heckewelder means by the remark that 'the principle of community of goods prevails in the state,' unless it be that the rule of hospitality was so all-pervading that it was tantamount to a community of goods, while individual property was everywhere recognized until it was freely surrendered. This may be the just view of the result of their communism and hospitality, but it is a higher one than I have been able to take. The household of the Mandans consisting of from twenty to forty persons, the households of the Columbian tribes of about the same number, the Shoshone household of seven families, the households of the Sauks, of the Iroquois, and of the Creeks each composed of several families, are fair types of the households of the Northern Indians at the epoch of their discovery. The fact is also established that these tribes constructed as a rule large joint tenement houses, each of which was occupied by a large household composed of several families, among whom provisions were in common, and who practiced communism in living in the household. Among the Village Indians of New Mexico a more advanced form of house architecture appears, and their joint tenement character is even more pronounced. They live in large houses, two, three, and four stories high, constructed of adobe brick, and of stone imbedded in adobe mortar, and containing fifty, a hundred, two hundred, and in some cases five hundred apartments in a house. They are built in the terraced form, with fireplaces and chimneys added since their discovery, the first story closed up solid, and is entered by ladders, which ascend to the platform-roof of the first story. These houses are fortresses, and were erected as strongholds to resist the attacks of the more barbarous tribes by whom they were perpetually assailed. Each house was probably occupied by a number of household groups, whose apartments were doubtless separated from each other by partition walls. In a subsequent chapter the character of these houses will be more fully shown. Our knowledge of the plan of life in these houses in the aboriginal period is still very imperfect. They still practice the old hospitality, own their lands in common, but with allotments to individuals and to families, and are governed by a cacique or sachem and certain other officers annually elected. An American missionary to the Laguna Village Indians, Rev. Samuel Gorman, in an address before the Historical Society of New Mexico in 869, remarks as follows: 'They generally marry very young, and the son-in-law becomes the servant of the father-in-law, and very often they all live together in one family for years, even if there be several sons-in-law; and this clannish mode of living is often, if not generally, a fruitful source of evil among this people. Their women generally have control over the granary, and they are more provident than their Spanish neighbors about the future. Ordinarily they try to have one year's provisions on hand. It is only when they have two years of scarcity succeeding each other that pueblos as a community suffer hunger.' The usages of these Indians have doubtless modified in the last two hundred years under Spanish influence; they have decreased in numbers, and the family group is probably smaller than formerly. But it is not too late to recover the aboriginal plan of life among them if the subject were intelligently investigated. It is to be hoped that some one will undertake this work. The Spanish writers do not mention the practice of communism in living as existing among the Village Indians of Mexico or Central America. They are barren of practical information concerning their mode of life; but we have the same picture of large households composed of several families, whose communism in the household may reasonably be inferred. We have also the striking illustration of 'Montezuma's Dinner,' hereafter to be noticed, which was plainly a dinner in common by a communal household. Beside these facts we have the ownership of lands in common by communities of persons. Moreover, the ruins of ancient houses in Central and South America, and in parts of Mexico, show very plainly their joint tenement character. From the plans of these houses the communism of the people by households may be deduced theoretically with reasonable certainty. Yucatan, when discovered, was occupied by a number of tribes of Maya Indians. The Maya language spread beyond the limits of Yucatan. This region, with Chiapas, Guatemala, and a part of Honduras, contained and still contains evidence, in the ruins of ancient structures, of a higher advancement in the arts of life than any other part of North America. The present Maya Indians of Yucatan are the descendants of the people who occupied the country at the period of the Spanish conquest, and who occupied the massive stone houses now in ruins, from which they were forced by Spanish oppression. We have a notable illustration of communism in living among the present Maya Indians, as late as the year 840, through the work of John L Stephens. At Nohcacab, a few miles east of the ruins of Uxmal, Mr. Stephens, having occasion to employ laborers, went to a settlement of Maya Indians, of whom he gives the following account: 'Their community consists of a hundred labradores, or working men; their lands are held and wrought in common, and the products are shared by all. Their food is prepared at one hut, and every family sends for its portion, which explains a singular spectacle we had seen on our arrival, a procession of women and children, each carrying an earthen bowl containing a quantity of smoking hot broth, all coming down the same road, and disappearing among the different huts. Every member belonging to the community, down to the smallest pappoose, contributing in turn a hog. From our ignorance of the language, and the number of other and more pressing matters claiming our attention, we could not learn all the details of their internal economy, but it seemed to approximate that improved state of association which is sometimes heard of among us; and as theirs has existed for an unknown length of time, and can no longer be considered merely experimental, Owen on Fourier might perhaps take lessons from them with advantage.' A hundred working men indicate a total of five hundred persons, who were then depending for their daily food upon a single fire, the provisions being supplied from common stores, and divided from the caldron. It is, not unlikely, a truthful picture of the mode of life of their forefathers in the 'House of the Nuns,' and in the 'Governor's House' at Uxmal, at the epoch of the Spanish conquest. It is well known that Spanish adventurers captured these pueblos, one after the other, and attempted to enforce the labor of the Indians for personal ends, and that the Indians abandoned their pueblos and retreated into the inaccessible forests to escape enslavement, after which their houses of stone fell into decay, the ruins of which, and all there ever was of them, still remain in all parts of these countries. It is hardly supposable that the communism here described by Mr. Stephens was a new thing to the Mayas; but far more probable that it was a part of their ancient mode of life, to which these ruined houses were eminently adapted. The subject of the adaptation of the old pueblo houses in Yucatan and Central America to communism in living will be elsewhere considered. When Columbus first landed on the island of Cuba, he sent two men into the interior, who reported that 'they traveled twenty-two leagues, and found a village of fifty houses, built like those before spoken of, and they contained about one thousand persons, because a whole generation lived in a house; and the prime men came out to meet them, led them by the arms, and lodged them in one of these new houses, causing them to sit down on seats. and they gave them boiled roots to eat, which tasted like chestnuts.' One of the first expeditions which touched the main land on the coast of Venezuela in South America found much larger houses than these last described. 'The houses they dwelt in were common to all, and so spacious that they contained one hundred and sixty persons, strongly built, though covered with palm-tree leaves, and shaped like a bell.' Herrera further remarks of the same tribe, that 'they observed no law or rule in matrimony, but took as many wives as they would, and they as many husbands, quitting one another at pleasure, without reckoning any wrong done on either part. There was no such thing as jealousy among them, all living as best pleased them, without taking offense at one another.' This shows communism in husbands as well as wives, and rendered communism in food a necessity of their condition. Elsewhere the same author speaks of the habitations of the tribes on the coast of Carthagena. 'Their houses were like long arbors, with several apartments, and they had no beds but hammocks.' Many similar statements are scattered through his work. Among the more advanced tribes of Peru the lands were divided, and allotted to different uses; one part was for the support of the government, another for the support of religion, and another for the support of individuals. The first two parts were cultivated by the people under established regulations, and the crops were placed in public storehouses. This is the statement of Garcilasso. Herrera, however, says generally that the people lived from common stores.""","""Indigenous communal living practices""","1957","""Indigenous communal living practices have long been an integral part of many cultures around the world. These practices encompass a deep sense of community, shared values, and a strong bond with nature. From North America to Africa, Asia to Australia, Indigenous communities have thrived for centuries through their communal living arrangements. This article delves into the significance, principles, and benefits of Indigenous communal living practices.  The cornerstone of Indigenous communal living is the idea of interconnectedness. Members of the community are deeply connected to each other, the land, and all living beings. This connection forms the basis of their social structure, where decisions are made collectively, considering the well-being of all members and the environment. Elders play a crucial role in guiding the community, passing down traditional knowledge, and fostering harmony within the group.  One of the key principles of Indigenous communal living is reciprocity. This concept emphasizes the importance of giving back to the community and the earth. In Indigenous cultures, sharing resources, knowledge, and skills is a fundamental aspect of communal living. This reciprocity fosters a sense of unity and ensures that everyone's needs are met, creating a more equitable and sustainable way of life.  Another vital aspect of Indigenous communal living is respect for the natural world. Indigenous communities view the earth as a living entity that must be revered and protected. Traditional ecological knowledge is passed down through generations, guiding sustainable practices that maintain a balance between human needs and the health of the environment. This deep respect for nature is reflected in Indigenous rituals, ceremonies, and daily interactions with the land.  Collaboration and cooperation are also central to Indigenous communal living practices. Working together towards common goals strengthens the community and promotes a sense of shared responsibility. Whether it's building shelters, harvesting crops, or celebrating cultural events, collective action is prioritized over individual pursuits. This spirit of cooperation fosters strong social bonds and a collective identity that transcends individual differences.  The benefits of Indigenous communal living are manifold. By sharing resources and responsibilities, communities ensure that no individual is left behind. This fosters a sense of security and belonging among members, reducing social inequalities and promoting inclusivity. Additionally, communal living promotes resilience in the face of challenges, as communities come together to support each other during difficult times.  Furthermore, Indigenous communal living practices offer valuable lessons in sustainability and environmental stewardship. By living in harmony with nature and utilizing traditional ecological knowledge, Indigenous communities exemplify a way of life that respects the earth's limits and promotes long-term well-being. In a world facing environmental crises, these practices serve as a source of inspiration for sustainable living.  In conclusion, Indigenous communal living practices embody a holistic approach to community life, guided by principles of interconnectedness, reciprocity, respect for nature, collaboration, and sustainability. These practices offer valuable insights into building resilient, inclusive, and environmentally conscious societies. By learning from Indigenous wisdom and incorporating these principles into modern life, we can create more harmonious communities that prioritize the well-being of all beings and the planet.""","601"

THE OF Habit in its simplest form is the tendency to do, think, or act as one has done, thought, or acted in the past. It is the tendency to repeat activities of all kinds. It is the tendency which makes one inclined to do the familiar action rather than a new one. In a broader sense, habit formation means learning. It is a statement of the fact that conduct is modifiable and that such modifications may become permanent. The fact of learning depends physiologically on the plasticity of the nervous system. The neurones, particularly those concerned with intellectual life, are not only sensitive to nerve currents but are modified by them. The point where the greatest change seems to take place is at the synapses, but what this modification is, no one knows. There are several theories offered as explanations of what happens, but no one of them has been generally accepted, although the theory of chemical change seems to be receiving the strongest support at present. There can be no disagreement, however, as to the effects of this change, whatever it may be. Currents originally passing with difficulty over a certain conduction unit later pass with greater and greater ease. The resistance which seems at first to be present gradually disappears, and to that extent is the conduct modified. This same element of plasticity accounts for the breaking of habits. In this case the action is double, for it implies the disuse of certain connections which have been made and the forming of others; for the breaking of a bad habit means the beginning of a good one. The plasticity of neurone groups seems to vary in two respects--as to modifiability and as to power to hold modifications. The neurone groups controlling the reflex and physiological operations are least easily modified, while those controlling the higher mental processes are most easily modified. The neurone groups controlling the instincts hold a middle place. So far as permanence goes, connections between sensorimotor neurone groups seem to hold modifications longer than do connections between either associative-motor or associative-association. It is probably because of this fact that habit in the minds of so many people refers to some physical activity. Of course this is a misconception. Wherever the nervous system is employed, habits are formed. There are intellectual, moral, emotional, temperamental habits, just as truly as physical habits. In the intellectual field every operation that involves association or memory also involves habits. Good temper, or the reverse, truthfulness, patriotism, thoughtfulness for others, open-mindedness, are as much matters of learning and of habit as talking or skating or sewing. Habit is found in all three lines of mental development: intellect, character, and skill. Not only does the law of habit operate in all fields of mental activity, but the characteristics which mark its operation are the same. Two of these are important. In the first place, habit formation results in a lessening of attention to the process. Any process that is habitual can be taken care of by a minimum of attention. In other words, it need no longer be in the focal point, but can be relegated to the fringe. At the beginning of the modification of the neurone tract focal attention is often necessary, but as it progresses less and less attention is needed until the activity becomes automatic, apparently running by itself. Not all habits reach this stage of perfection, but this is the general tendency. This lessening of the need for attention means that less energy is used by the activity, and the individual doing the work is less likely to be fatigued. In the second place, habit tends to make the process more and more sure in its results. As the resistance is removed from the synapses, and the one particular series of units come to act more and more as a unit, the current shoots along the path with no sidetracking, and the act is performed or the thought reached unwaveringly with very little chance of error. If the habit being formed is that of writing, the appropriate movements are made with no hesitation, and the chances that certain ones will be made the first time increase in probability. This means a saving of time and an increase in confidence as to the results. A consideration of these characteristics of habits makes clear its dangers as well as its values. The fact that habit is based on actual changes which take place in the nervous system, that its foundation is physical, emphasizes its binding power. Most people in talking and thinking of habit regard it as something primarily mental in nature and therefore believe all that is necessary to break any habit is the sufficient exercise of will power. But will power, however strong, cannot break actual physical connections, and it is such connections that bind us to a certain line of activity instead of any other, when once the habit is formed. It is just as logical to expect a car which is started on its own track to suddenly go off on to another track where there is no switch, as to expect a nerve current traveling along its habitual conduction unit to run off on some other line of nervous discharge. Habit once formed binds that particular line of thought to action, either good or bad. Of course habits may be broken, but it is a work of time and must result from definite physical changes. Every habit formed lessens the likelihood of any other response coming in that particular situation. Every interest formed, every act of skill perfected, every method of work adopted, every principle or ideal accepted, limits the recognition of any other possible line of action in that situation. Habit binds to one particular response and at the same time blinds the individual to any other alternative. The danger of this is obvious. If the habits formed are bad or wasteful ones, the individual is handicapped in his growth until new ones can be formed. On the other hand, habit makes for limitation. Despite these dangers, habit is of inestimable value in the development of both the individual and the human race. It is through it that all learning is possible. It makes possible the preservation of our social inheritance. As James says, 'Habit is the enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious conservative agent.' Because of its power of limitation it is sometimes considered the foe of independence and originality, but in reality it is the only road to progress. Other things being equal, the more good habits a person has, the greater the probability of his doing original work. The genius in science or in art or in statesmanship is the man who has made habitual many of the activities demanded by his particular field and who therefore has time and energy left for the kind of work that demands thinking. Habit won't make a genius, but all men of exceptional ability excel others in the number and quality of their habits in the field in which they show power. As the little child differs from the adult in the number and quality of his habits, so the ordinary layman differs from the expert. It is scarcity, not abundance, of habits that forces a man into a rut and keeps him mediocre. Just as the three year old, having taken four or five times as long as the adult to dress himself, is tired out at the end of the task, so the amateur in literature or music or morals as compared with the expert. The more habits any one has in any line, the better for him, both from the standpoint of efficiency and productivity, provided that the habits are good and that among them is found the habit of breaking habits. The two great laws of habit formation are the laws of exercise and effect. These laws apply in all cases of habit formation, whether they be the purposeless habits of children or the purposive habits of maturity. The law of exercise says that the oftener and the more emphatically a certain response is connected with a certain situation, the more likely is it to be made to that situation. The two factors of repetition and intensity are involved. It is a common observance that the oftener one does a thing, other things being equal, the better he does it, whether it be good or bad. Drill is the usual method adopted by all classes of people for habit formation. It is because of the recognition of the value of repetition that the old maxim of 'Practice makes Perfect' has been so blindly adhered to. Practice may make perfect, but it also may make imperfect. All that practice can do is to make more sure and automatic the activity, whatever it is. It cannot alone make for improvement. A child becomes more and more proficient in bad writing or posture, in incorrect work in arithmetic and spelling, with practice just as truly as under other conditions he improves in the same activities. Evidence from school experiments, which shows that as many as 0 per cent of the children examined did poorer work along such lines in a second test than in the first which had been given several months earlier, bears witness to the inability of mere repetition to get 'perfect' results. To get such results the repetition must be only of the improvements. There must be a constant variation towards the ideal, and a selection of just those variations for practice, if perfect as well as invariable results are to be obtained. The amount of repetition necessary in the formation of any given habit is not known.""","""Habit formation and learning dynamics.""","1939","""Habit formation and learning dynamics are essential components of human behavior and play a significant role in shaping our lives. Understanding how habits are formed and the dynamics of learning can help individuals make positive changes, break detrimental patterns, and cultivate personal growth. Whether in the realm of education, personal development, or professional success, harnessing the power of habits and learning dynamics can lead to transformative outcomes.  To delve into habit formation, it is crucial to first understand the underlying mechanisms that drive this process. Habits are essentially automatic behaviors that are triggered by cues in our environment, leading to a routine response. The habit loop consists of three key elements: cue, routine, and reward. The cue serves as a trigger that initiates the behavior, the routine is the behavior itself, and the reward provides positive reinforcement for the behavior, reinforcing its repetition.  Learning dynamics, on the other hand, encompass the processes through which individuals acquire new knowledge, skills, or behaviors. Learning is a complex and dynamic process influenced by various factors such as cognition, motivation, environment, and previous experiences. Understanding how individuals learn can help educators tailor their teaching methods to optimize learning outcomes for their students.  In the context of habit formation, learning dynamics play a crucial role in shaping our behaviors and routines. When we repeatedly engage in a behavior, we strengthen the neural pathways associated with that behavior, making it more automatic and ingrained. This process, known as neuroplasticity, highlights the brain's ability to reorganize itself based on experience, demonstrating the malleability of our habits and behaviors.  Changing habits or acquiring new ones requires a conscious effort to rewire our neural pathways through consistent practice and reinforcement. This process of habit modification involves identifying triggers that prompt unwanted behaviors, replacing them with healthier alternatives, and reinforcing these new behaviors through rewards. By understanding the interconnected nature of habits and learning, individuals can leverage this knowledge to break harmful patterns and cultivate positive habits that align with their goals.  Moreover, the concept of self-regulation plays a vital role in habit formation and learning dynamics. Self-regulation involves the ability to monitor, control, and adapt one's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in accordance with internal standards and external demands. Individuals with strong self-regulatory skills are better equipped to overcome temptations, delay gratification, and stay focused on their long-term goals, making them more adept at forming positive habits and maximizing their learning potential.  Furthermore, the role of reinforcement in habit formation and learning dynamics cannot be understated. Positive reinforcement involves rewarding desirable behaviors to increase the likelihood of their recurrence, while negative reinforcement entails removing aversive stimuli to strengthen desired behaviors. By implementing effective reinforcement strategies, individuals can accelerate the habit-forming process and enhance their learning outcomes through consistent feedback and encouragement.  In addition to understanding the mechanisms behind habit formation and learning dynamics, it is essential to recognize the impact of environmental cues and social influences on behavior. Our surroundings, social interactions, and culture can significantly shape our habits and learning experiences, highlighting the interconnectedness between individual behaviors and external factors.  Moreover, the concept of habit stacking can be a useful strategy in building new habits or enhancing existing ones. Habit stacking involves attaching a new behavior to an existing habit, leveraging the momentum of the established routine to facilitate the adoption of the new habit. By connecting desired behaviors to pre-existing cues or routines, individuals can streamline the habit formation process and increase the likelihood of successful implementation.  Furthermore, the power of mindset and beliefs in shaping habits and learning outcomes should not be overlooked. A growth mindset, characterized by the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and effort, can foster resilience, motivation, and a willingness to embrace challenges. By cultivating a growth mindset, individuals can overcome setbacks, learn from failures, and persist in their pursuit of mastery, ultimately facilitating the formation of positive habits and continuous learning.  In conclusion, habit formation and learning dynamics are intricately interconnected processes that influence our behaviors, choices, and outcomes. By understanding the underlying mechanisms driving habit formation, learning dynamics, and self-regulation, individuals can harness these insights to cultivate positive habits, enhance their learning experiences, and drive personal growth. Through conscious effort, effective reinforcement strategies, environmental awareness, and a growth mindset, individuals can unlock their potential, embrace change, and navigate their journey towards self-improvement and success in various aspects of life.""","869"
"Dos Passos John","""Oh to think of it! And Spain could be the richest country in Europe, if we had energy, organization, culture! Think of the exports: iron, coal, copper, silver, oranges, hides, mules, olives, food products, woolens, cotton cloth, sugarcane, raw cotton. couplets, dancers, gipsy girls.' The universal agent had quite lost his breath. He coughed for a long time into his crimson handkerchief, then looked about him over the rolling dun slopes to which the young grain sprouting gave a sheen of vivid green like the patina on a Pompeian bronze vase, and shrugged his shoulders. ' Que vida! What a life!' For some time a spire had been poking up into the sky at the road's end; now yellow-tiled roofs were just visible humped out of the wheatland, with the church standing guard over them, it's buttresses as bowed as the legs of a bulldog. At the sight of the village a certain spring came back to Telemachus's fatigue-sodden legs. He noticed with envy that Lyaeus took little skips as he walked. 'If we properly exploited our exports we should be the richest people in Europe,' the universal agent kept shouting with far-flung gestures of despair. And the last they heard from him as they left him to turn into the manure-littered, chicken-noisy courtyard of the Posada de la Luna was, ' Que pueblo indecente. What a beastly town. yet if they exploited with energy, with modern energy, their exports.' IX: An Inverted Midas Every age must have had choice spirits whose golden fingers turned everything they touched to commonplace. Since we know our own literature best it seems unreasonably well equipped with these inverted Midases--though the fact that all Anglo-American writing during the last century has been so exclusively of the middle classes, by the middle classes and for the middle classes must count for something. Still Rome had her Marcus Aurelius, and we may be sure that platitudes would have obscured the slanting sides of the pyramids had stone-cutting in the reign of Cheops been as disastrously easy as is printing to-day. The addition of the typewriter to the printing-press has given a new and horrible impetus to the spread of half-baked thought. The labor of graving on stone or of baking tablets of brick or even of scrawling letters on paper with a pen is no longer a curb on the dangerous fluency of the inverted Midas. He now lolls in a Morris chair, sipping iced tea, dictating to four blonde and two dark-haired stenographers; three novels, a couple of books of travel and a short story written at once are nothing to a really enterprising universal genius. Poor Julius Caesar with his letters! We complain that we have no supermen nowadays, that we can't live as much or as widely or as fervently or get through so much work as could Pico della Mirandola or Erasmus or Politian, that the race drifts towards mental and physical anmia. I deny it. With the typewriter all these things shall be added unto us. This age too has its great universal geniuses. They overrun the seven continents and their respective seas. Accompanied by mnadic bands of stenographers, and a music of typewriters deliriously clicking, they go about the world, catching all the butterflies, rubbing the bloom off all the plums, tunneling mountains, bridging seas, smoothing the facets off ideas so that they may be swallowed harmlessly like pills. With true Anglo-Saxon conceit we had thought that our own Mr. Wells was the most universal of these universal geniuses. He has so diligently brought science, ethics, sex, marriage, sociology, God, and everything else--properly deodorized, of course--to the desk of the ordinary man, that he may lean back in his swivel-chair and receive faint susuration from the sense of progress and the complexity of life, without even having to go to the window to look at the sparrows sitting in rows on the telephone-wires, so that really it seemed inconceivable that anyone should be more universal. It was rumored that there lay the ultimate proof of Anglo-Saxon ascendancy. What other race had produced a great universal genius? But all that was before the discovery of Blasco Ibanez. On the backs of certain of Blasco Ibanez's novels published by the Casa Prometeo in Valencia is this significant advertisement: Obras de Vulgarizacion Popular ('Works of Popular Vulgarization'). Under it is an astounding list of volumes, all either translated or edited or arranged, if not written from cover to cover, by one tireless pen,--I mean typewriter. Ten volumes of universal history, three volumes of the French Revolution translated from Michelet, a universal geography, a social history, works on science, cookery and house-cleaning, nine volumes of Blasco Ibanez's own history of the European war, and a translation of the Arabian Nights, a thousand and one of them without an hour missing. 'Works of Popular Vulgarization.' I admit that in Spanish the word vulgarizacion has not yet sunk to its inevitable meaning, but can it long stand such a strain? Add to that list a round two dozen novels and some books of travel, and who can deny that Blasco Ibanez is a great universal genius? Read his novels and you will find that he has looked at the stars and knows Lord Kelvin's theory of vortices and the nebular hypothesis and the direction of ocean currents and the qualities of kelp and the direction the codfish go in Iceland waters when the northeast wind blows; that he knows about Gothic architecture and Byzantine painting, the social movement in Jerez and the exports of Patagonia, the wall-paper of Paris apartment houses and the red paste with which countesses polish their fingernails in Monte Carlo. The very pattern of a modern major-general. And, like the great universal geniuses of the Renaissance, he has lived as well as thought and written. He is said to have been thirty times in prison, six times deputy; he has been a cowboy in the pampas of Argentina; he has founded a city in Patagonia with a bullring and a bust of Cervantes in the middle of it; he has rounded the Horn on a sailing-ship in a hurricane, and it is whispered that like Victor Hugo he eats lobsters with the shells on. He hobnobs with the universe. One must admit, too, that Blasco Ibanez's universe is a bulkier, burlier universe than Mr. Wells's. One is strangely certain that the axle of Mr. Wells's universe is fixed in some suburb of London, say Putney, where each house has a bit of garden where waddles an asthmatic pet dog, where people drink tea weak, with milk in it, before a gas-log, where every bookcase makes a futile effort to impinge on infinity through the encyclopedia, where life is a monotonous going and coming, swathed in clothes that must above all be respectable, to business and from business. But who can say where Blasco Ibanez's universe centers? It is in constant progression. Starting, as Walt Whitman from fish-shaped Paumonauk, from the fierce green fertility of Valencia, city of another great Spanish conqueror, the Cid, he had marched on the world in battle array. The whole history comes out in the series of novels at this moment being translated in such feverish haste for the edification of the American public. The beginnings are stories of the peasants of the fertile plain round about Valencia, of the fishermen and sailors of El Grao, the port, a sturdy violent people living amid a snappy fury of vegetation unexampled in Europe. His method is inspired to a certain extent by Zola, taking from him a little of the newspaper-horror mode of realism, with inevitable murder and sudden death in the last chapters. Yet he expresses that life vividly, although even then more given to grand vague ideas than to a careful scrutiny of men and things. He is at home in the strong communal feeling, in the individual anarchism, in the passionate worship of the water that runs through the fields to give life and of the blades of wheat that give bread and of the wine that gives joy, which is the moral make-up of the Valencian peasant. He is sincerely indignant about the agrarian system, about social inequality, and is full of the revolutionary bravado of his race. A typical novel of this period is La Barraca, a story of a peasant family that takes up land which has lain vacant for years under the curse of the community, since the eviction of the tenants, who had held it for generations, by a landlord who was murdered as a result, on a lonely road by the father of the family he had turned out. The struggle of these peasants against their neighbours is told with a good deal of feeling, and the culmination in a rifle fight in an irrigation ditch is a splendid bit of blood and thunder. There are many descriptions of local customs, such as the Tribunal of Water that sits once a week under one of the portals of Valencia cathedral to settle conflicts of irrigation rights, a little dragged in by the heels, to be sure, but still worth reading. Yet even in these early novels one feels over and over again the force of that phrase 'popular vulgarization.' Valencia is being vulgarized for the benefit of the universe. The proletariat is being vulgarized for the benefit of the people who buy novels. From Valencia raids seem to have been made on other parts of Spain. Sonnica la Cortesana gives you antique Saguntum and the usual 'Aves,' wreaths, flute-players and other claptrap of costume novels. In La Catedral you have Toledo, the church, socialism and the modern world in the shadow of Gothic spires. La Bodega takes you into the genial air of the wine vaults of Jerez-de-la-Frontera, with smugglers, processions blessing the vineyards and agrarian revolt in the background. Up to now they have been Spanish novels written for Spaniards; it is only with Sangre y Arena that the virus of a European reputation shows results.""","""Spain's potential as a rich nation""","2147","""Spain, a country rich in history, culture, and natural beauty, holds significant potential to further prosper as a wealthy nation. From its vibrant cities to picturesque coastlines and diverse landscapes, Spain offers a blend of tradition and modernity that attracts millions of tourists each year. With a strong agricultural sector, a growing industrial base, and a focus on renewable energy, Spain has the foundations to continue its economic development and enhance its position as a prosperous nation. By leveraging its strengths and addressing challenges, Spain can unlock its full potential and build a sustainable future for generations to come.  One of Spain's key assets is its strategic geographic location at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and the Atlantic Ocean. This location has historically played a vital role in trade and commerce, facilitating interactions with diverse cultures and economies. Today, Spain benefits from this position by serving as a gateway to Europe for businesses looking to expand into the European market. Its well-developed transportation infrastructure, including modern ports and airports, further enhances its connectivity and accessibility, making it an attractive hub for international trade and investment. By capitalizing on its geographical advantages, Spain can strengthen its economic ties with global partners and foster growth in key sectors.  The Spanish economy is characterized by a diverse range of industries that contribute to its overall prosperity. Agriculture has long been a significant sector in Spain, with the country being a leading producer of fruits, vegetables, and olive oil. The fertile lands and favorable climate support agricultural activities, while innovative practices and technologies have helped increase productivity and efficiency. Spain's agricultural exports play a crucial role in generating revenue and supporting rural livelihoods, highlighting the importance of this sector to the country's economy.  In addition to agriculture, Spain has a strong industrial base that includes sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and renewable energy. The automotive industry, in particular, is a key contributor to Spain's economy, with major manufacturers operating in the country and producing a significant number of vehicles for both domestic and international markets. The aerospace sector is another area of strength, with Spain being home to several leading companies involved in aircraft manufacturing and space technology. By capitalizing on its industrial capabilities and fostering innovation, Spain can further enhance its competitiveness and capture opportunities in emerging markets.  Renewable energy is an increasingly important sector for Spain, given its commitment to sustainability and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The country has made significant investments in wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, leading to a substantial increase in renewable energy production in recent years. Spain's transition to a low-carbon economy not only contributes to mitigating climate change but also creates new opportunities for growth and employment. By continuing to invest in clean energy technologies and infrastructure, Spain can position itself as a leader in the global shift towards sustainable energy sources.  Tourism is another major driver of Spain's economy, drawing visitors from around the world to its historic cities, beautiful beaches, and cultural landmarks. The tourism sector provides jobs for millions of people and generates significant revenue for the country. By promoting sustainable tourism practices, preserving cultural heritage, and diversifying offerings beyond traditional hotspots, Spain can further capitalize on its appeal as a top tourist destination and create lasting economic benefits for local communities.  Despite its strengths, Spain faces challenges that must be addressed to fully realize its potential as a wealthy nation. One such challenge is the issue of unemployment, particularly among young people. High youth unemployment rates have been a persistent problem in Spain, leading to social and economic consequences. By investing in education and training programs, promoting entrepreneurship, and creating more opportunities for youth employment, Spain can harness the potential of its young workforce and drive economic growth.  Another challenge for Spain is the need to address regional disparities and promote inclusive development. While major cities like Madrid and Barcelona thrive, other regions struggle with economic stagnation and high levels of poverty. By implementing policies that prioritize regional development, invest in infrastructure, and support small businesses in rural areas, Spain can create a more balanced and equitable economy that benefits all its citizens.  In conclusion, Spain's potential as a rich nation is grounded in its diverse economy, strategic location, and cultural heritage. By building on its strengths, fostering innovation, and addressing challenges, Spain can pave the way for sustained economic growth and prosperity. Through strategic investments in key sectors, promotion of sustainable practices, and inclusive development policies, Spain can unlock its full potential and emerge as a leading global player in the 21st century.""","883"
"Engel Sigmund","""All political parties consider the public elementary school to be extremely important, and each one of them wishes to use this institution for its own purposes. They all recognise that the future belongs to the young, that the public elementary school plays the leading part in the education of the young; and each party sees that its special aims can be attained only by the education of individuals to consider that these aims are sacred and desirable. The adherents of a particular political tendency therefore oppose the inculcation in the public elementary schools of any tendency adverse to their own, but they regard it as self-evident that their own views ought to be inculcated in the elementary school. Instruction versus Education.--Many persons contend that the aim of the school is not so much education as instruction. They consider that the main factor in education is not the school, but the family. But this is certain, that even in the school which thinks only of instructing its pupils, education in the wider sense is effected. In school life, in school friendships, in the sense of solidarity, in the friendly competition between schoolfellows, in the necessity to learn, are embodied powerful educative influences. It is, in fact, essential that the school should educate as well as instruct. The public elementary school of to-day makes therefore a very great mistake if it insists on intellectual rather than on moral education, and upon instruction rather than upon education. Moral Instruction.--According to the views of educationalists, it is the aim of the public elementary school to educate children to be, religious, patriotic, obedient, humble, subordinate citizens. The elementary school of to-day does in fact mainly subserve these ends. Religious instruction and the inculcation of the fear of God are no proper part of the work of the public elementary school. Among all the factors of education, it is certainly not the public elementary school which should undertake this branch of instruction. The public elementary school has to teach children to love their country; but this should on no account be done in such a way as to inspire hatred for other countries. The old elementary schools taught obedience and subordination. But to-day, when the conditions are quite different from those of the Middle Ages, the public elementary school should do nothing of the kind, but should rather teach independent judgment, promptness of action, and soundness of decision. The public elementary school is a public institution like and the post office, and compulsory school attendance is a civic duty analogous to the duty of military service. But it is necessary to protest most energetically against the inference sometimes drawn from the analogy between the two last-named duties, that the elementary school should be the preparatory school to the barrack, and the barrack a sort of continuation school to the elementary school--against the doctrine that children should be disciplined to a blind obedience. We must carefully avoid overestimating the importance of discipline. The school must and does use compulsion. Discipline is an important means of elementary school education, and such education is unthinkable without discipline. But children are sufficiently disciplined by mere attendance at school for a certain time. The following idea is very generally diffused, that it is the aim of the school to prepare children for the life they will have to lead when they are grown up. Most of the children attending the public elementary schools will become proletarians, wage-workers. Since the proletarian must be diligent, thrifty, humble, disciplined, it is regarded as the duty of the elementary school to inculcate these virtues. But these so-called virtues are not virtues at all. The greatest obstacle to any improvement in the lot of the average wage-earner is that he should be content with things as they are. The labourers wage represents the minimum that he finds requisite to the satisfaction of his needs; when his needs increase, his wages rise. Every friend of social progress should endeavour to secure that the elementary school should arouse in the children certain needs and desires. Many persons wish to utilise the public elementary school to turn children away from socialist ideas. This is to be done by making the children acquainted with the dangers which the realisation of socialist theories would involve, and in addition by inculcating in the children the afore-mentioned virtues. But the attainment of this end is less easy than such persons imagine. The public elementary school exercises a certain influence. The workman who has received at school education and instruction of the suggested type will doubtless less readily become an enthusiastic adherent of the socialist party than the workman who has never attended an elementary school, and who was an illiterate until he first came under the influence of his trade union. But the notions inculcated in the public elementary school in respect of obedience, humility, and the like are readily eradicated by a short experience of socialist comradeship, and replaced by social-democratic ideas. General Culture.--It is by no means one of the aims of the public elementary school to provide general culture. Even less is this the aim of education than it is the aim of the public elementary school--and the provision of general culture by the latter would appear to be entirely out of the question. During the few years a child spends at the public elementary school, it is impossible to attempt to impart all that is included in the wide field of general culture. Individuality.--A large proportion of those pupils with a well-marked individuality can develop their personality even in the school. The tendency of the school is in many cases to rub off the edges and corners of individuality. But it is impossible to approve of the extent to which, in the public elementary school of to-day, the childrens individuality is repressed. Our present elementary schools do not individualise enough. Their principal aim is, not so much to provide a sound education, as to force all the pupils through the same rigid curriculum, without making any allowance for their various special aptitudes. (For what good end is it that the modern educational authority should regulate every detail of school-life, down to the quality and price of the articles used in class, and even to the colour of the manuscript books and the precise number of pages they are to contain?) In the elementary school of to-day, owing to the large size of the classes and the small number and defective training of the teachers, individualisation is impossible. Beauty.--The school must not indeed attempt to make all the children into artists; but the children must most certainly be taught to understand and appreciate beauty--that is, the arts. Our present public elementary schools are extremely defective from this point of view. Knowledge.--Knowledge gives the individual power, and provides him with a powerful weapon in the struggle for existence. The dominant classes, for the protection of their own egoistic interests, keep knowledge for themselves, and refuse to provide the lower classes with the means and weapons for their liberation. The State insists upon a minimal quantity of knowledge for every one of its members, because this is to the interest of the community and of the upper classes. But since to impart to the common people anything beyond this minimum of knowledge would threaten the dominance of the upper classes, or would at any rate involve pecuniary sacrifices on the part of the latter, and since it might even lead to the liberation of the lower classes, the functional activity of the public elementary schools is kept at as low a level as possible, and is limited as much as possible both intrinsically and extrinsically. The State and the upper classes devote to popular education only such an amount as is found to be absolutely essential. They are well aware that much more could be done than is done in the way of popular education; but since they know also that this would redound chiefly to the advantage of the lower classes, they propose no advance upon the present system. This affords a satisfactory explanation of the fact that the modern State spends so much less upon elementary schools than upon middle or high schools--that is, upon institutions for the upper classes, and why the State spends so much less upon education in general than upon other things. The budget of any modern State would exemplify the fact that the individualist State spends at least five times as much for military purposes as upon elementary education. The more complete the division of labour, the more do employers tend to utilise the services of unskilled labourers--that is, the services of those whose work is of such a character that all they need know to enable them to perform it is at most a little reading, writing, and arithmetic. The capitalists have no use for workmen with more knowledge than this, for the unskilled workers are cheaper. The owning class are not inclined to make sacrifices to enable the children of workpeople to learn more in the elementary school. They know very well that to do this would merely be to do themselves harm, for the more the workman knows the more readily does he think independently, the more critical is he, and the more readily does he recognise the defects of the existing social order.""","""Role of Public Elementary Education""","1819","""Public elementary education plays a crucial role in shaping the future of individuals and society as a whole. It serves as the foundation for a child's academic, social, and emotional development, setting the stage for lifelong learning and success. By providing a structured and accessible educational platform, public elementary schools help level the playing field for all students, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.  At the core of public elementary education is the mission to provide quality education to every child, ensuring that they acquire essential knowledge and skills to thrive in an ever-changing world. In addition to academics, elementary schools also focus on fostering social skills, critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. These formative years are crucial for building a strong educational base that will benefit students throughout their lives.  One of the key advantages of public elementary education is its universal accessibility. By being free and open to all children in the community, regardless of their economic status, public schools promote inclusivity and diversity. This inclusive environment helps children learn to interact with peers from different backgrounds, fostering a sense of empathy, understanding, and respect for diversity from a young age.  Furthermore, public elementary schools play a vital role in addressing educational inequalities. By providing a standard curriculum and qualified teachers, these schools aim to bridge the gap between students from different socio-economic backgrounds, offering equal opportunities for all children to succeed academically. Through various programs and initiatives, public schools strive to support students who may face challenges outside the classroom, ensuring that their academic needs are met.  In addition to academic education, public elementary schools also offer support services that address the holistic development of students. This may include counseling, special education programs, extracurricular activities, and access to resources for students with diverse learning needs. By providing a supportive and nurturing environment, public schools help students build resilience, self-confidence, and a sense of belonging.  Public elementary education also plays a role in promoting civic values and community engagement. By instilling a sense of responsibility, ethics, and citizenship in students, schools contribute to the development of socially responsible individuals who are committed to contributing positively to society. Through community service projects, partnerships with local organizations, and experiential learning opportunities, public schools encourage students to become active participants in their communities.  Moreover, public elementary education serves as a vital tool for promoting social mobility and reducing societal inequalities. By offering a high-quality education to all children, regardless of their background, public schools empower students to break the cycle of poverty and achieve their full potential. This not only benefits the individual students but also society as a whole by fostering a skilled and knowledgeable workforce that drives economic growth and innovation.  In conclusion, public elementary education is a cornerstone of a thriving society, providing children with the knowledge, skills, and values they need to succeed in the modern world. By offering a comprehensive and inclusive educational experience, public schools play a pivotal role in shaping the future generation and building a more equitable and prosperous society for all.""","590"
"Redway Jacques W  Jacques Wardlaw ","""After about sixty years of strained relations between the two sections there occurred the Civil War which wiped out nearly one million lives, and rolled up a debt, direct and indirect, of nearly six billions of dollars. The world's cotton-crop aggregates from twelve million to fifteen million bales yearly, of which the United States produces, as a rule, a little more than three-fourths. Egypt is rapidly taking an important place among cotton-producing countries, and, with the completion of the various irrigating canals, will very soon rank next to the United States. India ranks about third; China and Korea produce about the same quantity. There are a few cotton-cloth mills in these states, but in Japan the manufacture is increasing, the mills being equipped with the best of modern machinery. Brazil has a small product, and Russia in Asia needs transportation facilities only to increase largely its growing output. The cotton-crop of the United States is quite evenly distributed; one-third is manufactured at home; one-third is purchased by Great Britain; and the remaining third goes mainly to western Europe. In the past few years China has become a constantly increasing purchaser of American cotton. New Orleans, Galveston, Savannah, and New York are the chief ports of shipment. The imported Egyptian and Peruvian cotton is landed mainly at New York. Most of the cotton manufacture is carried on in the New England States, but there is a very rapid extension of cotton manufacture in the South. =Wool.=--The wool of commerce is a term applied to the fleece of the common sheep, to that of certain species of goat, and to that of the camel and its kind. There is no hard-and-fast distinction between hair and wool, but, in general, wool fibres have rough edges, much resembling overlapping scales which interlock with one another; hair, as a rule, has a hard, smooth surface. If a mass of loose wool be spread out and beaten, or if it be pressed between rollers, the fibres interlock so closely that there results a thick, strong cloth which has been made without either spinning or weaving. This property, known as 'felting,' gives to wool a great part of its value, and is its chief distinction from hair. Some kinds of hair, however, have a slight felting property, and if sufficiently fine may be spun and woven. The hair of the common goat is worthless for this purpose, but that of the Cashmere and Angora species have the properties of wool. The hair of the Bactrian camel, and also that of the llama, alpaca, and vicuna is soft and fine, possessing felting qualities that make it very superior as a textile. The quality of wool varies greatly according to the conditions of soil, climate, and the character of the food of the animal. In commerce, however, the fleeces are commonly graded as 'long-staple,' 'short-staple,' 'merino,' and 'coarse.' In long-staple wools the fibres are from four to eight inches long; they are more easily separated by a process much like combing, and are therefore called 'combing' wools. The cotswold, cheviot, and most of the wools of the British Isles are of this kind; indeed, in fairly moist lowland regions such as Canada and the United States, there is a tendency toward the development of a long-staple product. The English long-staple wools are largely made into worsted cloth, the Scotch cheviot into tweeds, and the French into the best dress cloth. If the fibres are materially less than four inches in length, the product is classed as a short-staple or 'carding' wool. By far the greater part of the wool of the United States, Canada, and Europe is of this class. It is disposed of according to its fineness or fitness for special purposes, the greater part being made into cloths for the medium grades of men's clothing. The finest and softest wool as a rule is grown in arid, plateau regions, and of this kind of staple the merino is an example. The fibres are fine as silk, and the goods made from them are softer. The Mission wool of California is the product of merino sheep, and, indeed, the conditions of climate in southern California and Australia are such as to produce the best merino wool. The famous Electoral wool of Saxony is a merino, the sheep having been introduced into that country from Spain about three hundred years ago. The merino wools, as a rule, are used in the most highly finished dress and fancy goods. The coarse-staple wools are very largely used for American carpets, coarse blankets, and certain kinds of heavy outer clothing. The Russian Donskoi wool, some of the Argentine fleeces, such as the Cordoban, and many of those grown in wet lowlands are very coarse and harsh. The quality is due more to climatic conditions and food than to the species of sheep; indeed, sheep that in other regions produce a fine wool, when introduced to this locality, after a few generations produce coarse wool. The rug wools grown in Persia, Turkestan, Turkey in Asia, and the Caucasus Mountains are also characteristic. They vary in fineness, and because they do not readily felt they are the best in the world for rug stock. The 'pile' or surface of the rug remains elastic and stands upright even after a hundred years of wear. This quality is due mainly to conditions of climate and soil. In some instances the wool is obtained by a daily combing of the half-grown lambs. This process, however, is employed in the rug-making districts only; in general, the fleeces are clipped either with shears or machine clippers. In the United States the latter are generally employed, and but little attempt is made either to sort the fleeces or to separate the various qualities of wool in the same fleece. The raw wool always contains foreign matter such as burs and dirt; it is also saturated with a natural oil which prevents felting. The oil, commonly called 'grease,' or 'yolk,' is an important article of commerce; under the name of 'lanolin' (adeps lan) it is used in medicine and pharmacy as a basis for ointments. The world's yearly clip is a little more than two and one-half billion pounds, of which the United States produces about one-eighth. In Europe and the United States, owing to the increasing value of the land, the area of production is decreasing; in Australia, South Africa, and Argentina, where land is cheap, it is increasing. From these three regions wool is exported; most European countries and the United States buy it. In the latter country the consumption is about six pounds for each person. The wools of the Mediterranean countries--France, Spain, Italy, Algiers, Egypt, etc.--are the best for fine cloths; those of central Asia for rugs and shawls; the others are used mainly in medium and low grade textiles. =Other Wools.=--The Angora goat, originally grown in the natural food of the insect, and silk-growing cannot be carried on in regions where this tree does not thrive. Not all areas that produce the mulberry-tree, however, will also grow the silk-worm; the latter cannot exist in regions having very cold winters, and therefore the industry is restricted by climate. The moth, shortly after emerging from the chrysalis stage, lays from two or three hundred to seven hundred eggs. These are 'hardy'--that is, they will remain fertile for a long time if kept in a cool, dry place; moisture will cause them to putrify, and heat to germinate. If well protected, they may be transported for distances. In rearing the silk-worm, as soon as the latter is hatched, it is placed on mulberry-leaves, and for five weeks it does nothing but eat, in that time consuming many times its weight of food. Then it begins to spin the material that forms its chrysalis case or cocoon.""","""Cotton and wool production history""","1685","""Cotton and wool have played significant roles in the history of human civilization, dating back thousands of years. The production of these natural fibers has shaped economies, cultures, and even technology. Let's dive into the fascinating history of cotton and wool production.  Cotton production has ancient origins, with evidence of cotton cultivation dating back to as early as 6000 BC in the Indus Valley Civilization. Over time, cotton cultivation spread to various regions, including Egypt, China, and the Americas. The invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in the late 18th century revolutionized cotton production by automating the process of separating seeds from the cotton fibers. This invention led to the rapid expansion of cotton plantations in the southern United States but also perpetuated the brutal system of slavery.  The Industrial Revolution further transformed cotton production, with the invention of mechanized spinning and weaving machines. This mechanization significantly increased the efficiency of cotton production, leading to the growth of textile industries in countries like England, India, and the United States. Cotton became known as """"white gold"""" due to its economic importance and the wealth it generated for nations and individuals involved in its production.  Wool production, on the other hand, has a rich history dating back to ancient times. Sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated for their wool, meat, and milk. The production of wool was integral to the economies of civilizations such as ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The quality of wool was highly prized, with fine wool varieties like Merino becoming sought after for their softness and warmth.  During the Middle Ages, wool production boomed in Europe, particularly in England. The wool trade became a cornerstone of the English economy, leading to the accumulation of wealth among wool merchants and the establishment of trade guilds. The Industrial Revolution brought mechanization to the wool industry as well, with the invention of spinning jennies and power looms revolutionizing the production process.  Both cotton and wool production have faced challenges and controversies throughout history. The use of child labor and harsh working conditions in textile mills during the Industrial Revolution sparked social reform movements advocating for labor rights and better working conditions. In more recent times, concerns have been raised about the environmental impact of cotton production, particularly the use of pesticides and water-intensive cultivation practices.  Despite these challenges, cotton and wool continue to be vital components of the global textile industry. Sustainable practices such as organic cotton farming and ethical wool production are gaining traction as consumers become more conscious of the origins of their clothing. The development of new technologies in textile production, such as recycled cotton and wool fibers, highlights efforts to make the industry more eco-friendly and socially responsible.  In conclusion, the histories of cotton and wool production are intricately woven into the fabric of human civilization. From ancient civilizations to modern industrial complexes, these natural fibers have shaped economies, societies, and cultures around the world. As we continue to innovate and evolve in the way we produce and consume textiles, it is essential to remember the rich heritage and impact of cotton and wool in our shared history.""","620"
"Hale Edward Everett","""My only distinct recollection of the matter is, that Charles lost his head.' Now you see it is of no sort of consequence how Mr. Lincoln got his thoroughly sound knowledge of the history of England,--in which, by the way, he was entirely at home,--and he had a perfect right to pay the compliment he did to Mr. Seward; but it was of great importance to him that he should not be haunted with the fear that the other man did know, really, of some important piece of negotiation of which he was ignorant. It was important to him to know that, so that he might be sure that his joke was--as it was--exactly the fitting answer. Fourth, it is necessary that every intelligent American or Englishman should have read carefully most of Shakespeare's plays. Most people would have named them before the history, but I do not. I do not care, however, how early you read them in life, and, as we shall see, they will be among your best guides for the history of England. Lastly, it is a disgrace to read even the newspaper, without knowing where the places are which are spoken of. You need, therefore, the very best atlas you can provide yourself with. The atlas you had when you studied geography at school is better than none. But if you can compass any more precise and full, so much the better. Colton's American Atlas is good. The large cheap maps, published two on one roller by Lloyd, are good; if you can give but five dollars for your maps, perhaps this is the best investment. Mr. Fay's beautiful atlas costs but three and a half dollars. For the other hemisphere, Black's Atlas is good. Rogers's, published in Edinburgh, is very complete in its American maps. Stieler's is cheap and reliable. When people talk of the 'books which no gentleman's library should be without,' the list may be boiled down, I think--if in any stress we should be reduced to the bread-and-water diet--to such books as will cover these five fundamental necessities. If you cannot buy the Bible, the agent of the County Bible Society will give you one. You can buy the whole of Shakespeare for fifty cents in Dicks's edition. And, within two miles of the place where you live, there are books enough for all the historical study I have prescribed. So, in what I now go on to say, I shall take it for granted that we have all of us made thus much preparation, or can make it. These are the central stores of the picnic, which we can fall back upon, after our explorations in our various lines of literature. Now for our several courses of reading. How am I to know what are your several tastes, or the several lines of your genius? Here are, as I learn from Mr. Osgood, some seventy-six thousand five hundred and forty-three Young Folks, be the same more or less, who are reading this paper. How am I to tell what are their seventy-six thousand five hundred and forty-three tastes, dispositions, or lines of genius? I cannot tell. Perhaps they could not tell themselves, not being skilled in self-analysis; and it is by no means necessary that they should be able to tell. Perhaps we can set down on paper what will be much better, the rules or the system by which each of them may read well in the line of his own genius, and so find out, before he has done with this life, what the line of that genius is, as far as there is any occasion. Do Not Try To Read Everything. That is the first rule. Do not think you must be a Universal Genius. Do not 'read all Reviews,' as an old code I had bade young men do. And give up, as early as you can, the passion, with which all young people naturally begin, of 'keeping up with the literature of the time.' As for the literature of the time, if one were to adopt any extreme rule, Mr. Emerson's would be the better of the two possible extremes. He says it is wise to read no book till it has been printed a year; that, before the year is well over, many of those books drift out of sight, which just now all the newspapers are telling you to read. But then, seriously, I do not suppose he acts on that rule himself. Nor need you and I. Only, we will not try to read them all. Here I must warn my young friend Jamie not to go on talking about renouncing 'nineteenth century trash.' It will not do to use such words about a century in which have written Goethe, Fichte, Cuvier, Schleiermacher, Martineau, Scott, Tennyson, Thackeray, Browning, and Dickens, not to mention a hundred others whom Jamie likes to read as much as I do. No. We will trust to conversation with the others, who have had their different paths in this picnic party of ours, to learn from them just the brightest and best things that they have seen and heard. And we will try to be able to tell them, simply and truly, the best things we find on our own paths. Now, for selecting the path, what shall we do,--since one cannot in one little life attempt them all? You can select for yourself, if you will only keep a cool head, and have your eyes open. First of all, remember that what you want from books is the information in them, and the stimulus they give to you, and the amusement for your recreation. You do not read for the poor pleasure of saying you have read them. You are reading for the subject, much more than for the particular book, and if you find that you have exhausted all the book has on your subject, then you are to leave that book, whether you have read it through or not. In some cases you read because the author's own mind is worth knowing; and then the more you read the better you know him. But these cases do not affect the rule. You read for what is in the books, not that you may mark such a book off from a 'course of reading,' or say at the next meeting of the 'Philogabblian Society' that you 'have just been reading Kant' or 'Godwin.' What is the subject, then, which you want to read upon? Half the boys and girls who read this have been so well trained that they know. They know what they want to know. One is sure that she wants to know more about Mary Queen of Scots; another, that he wants to know more about fly-fishing; another, that she wants to know more about the Egyptian hieroglyphics; another, that he wants to know more about propagating new varieties of pansies; another, that she wants to know more about 'The Ring and the Book'; another, that he wants to know more about the 'Tenure of Office bill' Happy is this half. To know your ignorance is the great first step to its relief. To confess it, as has been said before, is the second. In a minute I will be ready to say what I can to this happy half; but one minute first for the less happy half, who know they want to read something because it is so nice to read a pleasant book, but who do not know what that something is. They come to us, as their ancestors came to a relative of mine who was librarian of a town library sixty years ago: 'Please, sir, mother wants a sermon book, and another book.' To these undecided ones I simply say, now has the time come for decision. Your school studies have undoubtedly opened up so many subjects to you that you very naturally find it hard to select between them. Shall you keep up your drawing, or your music, or your history, or your botany, or your chemistry? Very well in the schools, my dear Alice, to have started you in these things, but now you are coming to be a woman, it is for you to decide which shall go forward; it is not for Miss Winstanley, far less for me, who never saw your face, and know nothing of what you can or cannot do. Now you can decide in this way. Tell me, or tell yourself, what is the passage in your reading or in your life for the last week which rests on your memory. Let us see if we thoroughly understand that passage. If we do not, we will see if we cannot learn to. That will give us a 'course of reading' for the next twelve months, or if we choose, for the rest of our lives. There is no end, you will see, to a true course of reading; and, on the other hand, you may about as well begin at one place as another. Remember that you have infinite lives before you, so you need not hurry in the details for fear the work should be never done. Now I must show you how to go to work, by supposing you have been interested in some particular passage. Let us take a passage from Macaulay, which I marked in the Edinburgh Review for Sydney to speak, twenty-nine years ago,--I think before I had ever heard Macaulay's name. A great many of you boys have spoken it at school since then, and many of you girls have heard scraps from it. It is a brilliant passage, rather too ornate for daily food, but not amiss for a luxury, more than candied orange is after a state dinner. He is speaking of the worldly wisdom and skilful human policy of the method of organization of the Roman Catholic Church. He says:-- 'The history of that Church joins together the two great ages of human civilization. No other institution is left standing which carries the mind back to the times when the smoke of sacrifice rose from the Pantheon, when camelopards and tigers bounded in the Flavian amphitheatre. The proudest royal houses are but of yesterday, when compared with the line of the Supreme Pontiffs. That line we trace back in an unbroken series, from the Pope who crowned Napoleon in the nineteenth century, to the Pope who crowned Pepin in the eighth; and far beyond the time of Pepin the august dynasty extends, till it is lost in the twilight of fable. The Republic of Venice came next in antiquity. But the Republic of Venice was modern when compared to the Papacy; and the Republic of Venice is gone, and the Papacy remains. The Papacy remains, not in decay, not a mere antique, but full of life and youthful vigor.""","""Reading and Historical Knowledge Strategies""","2196","""Reading is not just about consuming words; it is a gateway to historical knowledge, offering insights into the past, shaping the present, and guiding the future. In today's fast-paced world, where information bombardment is common, developing effective reading strategies that enhance our understanding of history is paramount. By delving into the realms of historical literature, primary sources, and academic texts, readers can unlock a treasure trove of wisdom that expands their perspectives and enriches their intellectual horizons.  Historical knowledge provides us with a context to understand the world around us. By immersing ourselves in historical readings, we gain a deeper appreciation of how societies have evolved, cultures have intermingled, and events have unfolded over time. Through the lens of history, we can analyze past decisions, decipher their consequences, and draw parallels to current issues. Moreover, historical knowledge equips us with critical thinking skills, enabling us to question assumptions, challenge narratives, and form informed opinions based on evidence and analysis.  To make the most of historical readings, it is essential to adopt effective strategies that enhance comprehension, retention, and application of knowledge. One key strategy is active reading, which involves engaging with the text proactively rather than passively. This can be achieved by previewing the material, annotating key points, asking questions, and making connections with prior knowledge. By actively reading historical texts, readers can extract deeper meanings, identify patterns, and grasp the underlying themes that shape historical events.  Another crucial strategy is to diversify reading materials to gain a well-rounded understanding of history. While textbooks provide a foundational overview, delving into primary sources such as diaries, letters, speeches, and archival documents offers a firsthand glimpse into the past. Reading historical fiction can also add a humanistic touch to factual accounts, immersing readers in personal narratives that bring history to life. Moreover, exploring academic journals, research papers, and scholarly articles can provide a nuanced perspective on complex historical topics, offering insights from experts in the field.  Furthermore, cultivating strong analytical skills is essential for interpreting historical readings effectively. Readers should learn to evaluate sources critically, considering the author's credibility, biases, and intentions. By cross-referencing multiple sources and examining differing viewpoints, readers can construct a more comprehensive understanding of historical events. Additionally, honing the ability to discern between primary and secondary sources, distinguishing between fact and interpretation, and recognizing historical context is vital for extracting meaningful insights from readings.  Incorporating interdisciplinary approaches can also enhance the depth of historical knowledge gained from readings. Drawing connections between history and other disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics can offer a holistic perspective on historical events. By exploring the intersections between different fields of study, readers can unearth multidimensional interpretations of historical phenomena, shedding light on the intricate web of factors that have shaped human history.  Moreover, reflecting on the relevance of historical knowledge to contemporary issues is crucial for applying insights gained from readings. By linking historical events to present-day challenges, readers can draw parallels, draw lessons, and make informed decisions informed by the past. Understanding the historical roots of societal problems, political conflicts, and cultural dynamics can provide valuable insights into navigating current complexities and shaping a more informed future.  In addition to individual reading strategies, engaging in discussions, joining study groups, and participating in historical forums can enrich the reading experience by fostering dialogue, exchange of ideas, and collaborative learning. By sharing perspectives with fellow enthusiasts, readers can gain new insights, challenge assumptions, and deepen their appreciation of historical narratives through diverse viewpoints.  Embracing technology as a tool for historical exploration can also enhance the reading experience. Online archives, digital libraries, and historical databases offer a vast repository of resources that make accessing primary sources, scholarly articles, and historical documents more convenient. Virtual tours of historical sites, interactive timelines, and multimedia presentations can complement traditional readings, providing a multi-sensory approach to understanding history.  Furthermore, adopting a mindful approach to reading can significantly impact the way historical knowledge is absorbed and retained. Practicing mindfulness while engaging with historical texts involves being fully present, focused, and attentive to the material at hand. By immersing oneself in the narrative, connecting emotionally with historical figures, and visualizing past events, readers can forge a deeper connection with history, fostering empathy, understanding, and appreciation for the complexities of the human experience.  In conclusion, reading is a powerful tool for gaining historical knowledge that transcends time, enriches perspectives, and shapes our understanding of the world. By employing effective reading strategies, such as active reading, diversifying materials, analyzing sources critically, and embracing interdisciplinary approaches, readers can unlock the depths of historical wisdom contained in texts. By reflecting on the relevance of historical knowledge to contemporary issues, engaging in dialogue with others, leveraging technology for exploration, and practicing mindfulness while reading, individuals can enrich their historical understanding and cultivate a profound appreciation for the lessons of the past that illuminate the path to the future.""","990"
"Lincoln Frederick Charles","""A few of these movements reoccur year after year with calendar-like regularity. Each species, or group of species, migrates at a particular time of the year and some at a particular time of the day. In this section some of the interesting differences will be discussed as to when birds migrate. Time of Year Some species begin their fall migrations early in July, and in other species distinct southward movements can be detected late into the winter. While some migrants are still traveling south, some early spring migrants can be observed returning north through the same locality. For example, many shorebirds start south in the early part of July, while the goshawks, snowy owls, redpolls, and Bohemian waxwings do not leave the North until forced to do so by the advent of severe winter weather or a lack of customary food. Thus an observer in the northern part of the United States may record an almost unbroken southward procession of birds from midsummer to winter and note some of the returning migrants as early as the middle of February. While on their way north, purple martins have been known to arrive in Florida late in January, and, among late migrants, the northern movement may continue well into June. In some species the migration is so prolonged that the first arrivals in the southern part of the breeding range will have performed their parental duties and may actually start south while others of the species are still on their way north. A study of these facts indicates the existence of northern and southern populations of the same species that have quite different migration schedules. In fall, migratory populations that nest farthest south migrate first to the winter range because they finish nesting first. For example, the breeding range of the black-and-white warbler covers much of the eastern United States and southern Canada northwest through the prairies to Great Bear Lake in, if 0 days are required to cross the breeding range, and if 0 days are allowed for reproductive activities and molting, they would not be ready to start southward before the middle of July. Then with a return 0-day trip south, the earliest migrants from the northern areas would reach the Gulf Coast in September. Since adults and young have been observed on the northern coast of South America by August 1, it is very likely that they must have come from the southern part of the nesting area. Many similar cases might be mentioned, such as the black-throated blue warblers still observed in the mountains of Haiti during the middle of May when others of this species are en route through North Carolina to New England breeding grounds. Redstarts and yellow warblers, evidently the more southern breeders, are seen returning southward on the northern coast of South America just about the time the earliest of those breeding in the North reach Florida on their way to winter quarters. Examples of the Alaska race of the yellow warbler have been collected in Mississippi, Florida, and the District of Columbia as late as October. Students of migration know that birds generally travel in waves, the magnitude of which varies with populations, species, weather, and time of year. Characteristically, one will observe a few early individuals come into an area followed by a much larger volume of migrants. This peak will then gradually taper off to a few lingering stragglers. If we plot numbers observed against time, the rising and receding curve takes the form of a bell. In the northern part of the United States there are two general migration waves. The first one in early spring consists of 'hardy' birds including many of our common seed eaters like the finches, sparrows, and others. The second wave occurs about a month later and consists primarily of insect-eating birds, such as flycatchers, vireos, warblers, and the like. Each of these species in turn has its own 'curve' of migration in the major wave. Time of Day Because most birds appear to be creatures of daylight, it seems remarkable that many should select the night for extended travel. Among the many nocturnal migrants are the smaller birds such as rails, flycatchers, orioles, most of the sparrows, the warblers, vireos, thrushes, and shorebirds. It is common to find woods and fields on one day almost barren of bird life and on the following day filled with sparrows, warblers, and thrushes, which indicates the arrival of migrants during the night. Waterfowl hunters sitting in their 'blinds' frequently observe the passage of flocks of ducks and geese, but great numbers of these birds also pass through at night; the calls of Canada geese or the conversational gabbling of a flock of ducks are common night sounds in spring and fall in many parts of the country. Observations made with telescopes focused on the full moon have shown processions of birds, and one observer estimated their passage over his area at the rate of,00 per hour. This gives some indication of the numbers of birds in the air at night during peaks of migration. At such times radar observations have shown that nocturnal migration begins about an hour after sundown, reaches a peak shortly before midnight, and then gradually tapers off until daybreak. Unless special circuits are installed in radar sets, bird echoes during peak migration periods may cover a radar screen. It has been suggested that small birds migrate by night to avoid their enemies. To a certain extent this may be true because the group includes not only weak fliers, such as the rails, but also the small song and insectivorous birds, such as wrens, small woodland flycatchers, and other species that habitually live more or less in concealment. These birds are probably much safer making their flights under the protecting cloak of darkness. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that night migrants include also the snipe, sandpipers, and plovers. Most shorebirds are usually found in the open and are among the more powerful fliers, as some of them make annual migratory flights over,00 miles nonstop across the ocean. Night travel is probably best for the majority of birds chiefly from the standpoint of feeding. Digestion is very rapid in birds and yet the stomach of one killed during the day almost always contains food. To replace the energy required for long flight, it is essential that either food be obtained at comparatively short intervals or stores of fat be laid on prior to migration. If the smaller migrants were to make protracted flights by day they would arrive at their destination at nightfall almost exhausted, but since they are entirely daylight feeders, they would be unable to obtain food until the following morning. Unless reserve energy was carried in the form of fat, the inability to feed would delay further flights and result in great exhaustion or possibly even death should their evening arrival coincide with cold or stormy weather. By traveling at night, they can pause at daybreak and devote the entire period of daylight to alternate feeding and resting. This schedule permits complete recuperation and resumption of the journey on a subsequent evening after sufficient energy has been restored. The day migrants include, in addition to some of the ducks and geese, the loons, cranes, gulls, pelicans, hawks, swallows, nighthawks, and swifts. Soaring birds, including broad-winged hawks, storks, and vultures, can only migrate during the day because their mode of flight makes them dependent on up-drafts created by heat from the sun for their long distance travels. On the other hand, swifts and swallows feed entirely on diurnal flying insects. The circling flocks are frequently seen in late summer feeding as they travel while working gradually southward. Formerly, great flocks of red-tailed, Swainson's, and rough-legged hawks could be seen wheeling majestically across the sky in the Plains States. In the East, good flights of broad-winged, Cooper's, and sharp-shinned hawks are still often seen, particularly along the Appalachian ridges. Because many species of wading and swimming birds are able to feed at all hours, they migrate either by day or night and are not accustomed to seek safety in concealment. Some diving birds, including ducks that submerge when in danger, often travel over water by day and over land at night. Strong fliers like the snow geese can make the entire trip from their staging area in James Bay, Canada, to the wintering grounds on the Louisiana Gulf coast in one continuous flight. These birds are seldom shot by hunters en route between these two points but are often observed, when migrating, by aircraft pilots. Graham Cooch of the Canadian Wildlife Service tracked a flight of the blue phase of this species in 95/85/8.""","""Bird Migration Patterns and Behavior""","1785","""Bird Migration Patterns and Behavior  Bird migration is a fascinating natural phenomenon that showcases the incredible abilities and instincts of birds to travel vast distances on a seasonal basis. This behavior is driven by a combination of factors such as food availability, breeding cycles, and climate changes. Throughout history, scientists and bird enthusiasts have been captivated by the intricate patterns and behaviors displayed by migratory birds. Understanding the mechanisms behind bird migration not only sheds light on the remarkable adaptability of these creatures but also highlights the interconnectedness of ecosystems on a global scale.  Migration Routes and Timing  Birds migrate along established routes known as flyways, which are essentially highways in the skies that birds follow during their seasonal journeys. There are four main flyways: the Pacific Flyway, Central Flyway, Mississippi Flyway, and Atlantic Flyway. Birds follow these routes to take advantage of favorable conditions such as wind patterns and food sources. The timing of migration is crucial for birds to ensure they arrive at their destinations when resources are abundant. Most birds migrate either during the day or at night, depending on their species and the distance they need to cover.  Migration Distances  The distances covered by migratory birds vary greatly depending on the species. While some birds travel relatively short distances, others undertake incredible journeys spanning thousands of miles. Arctic Terns, for example, hold the record for the longest migration of any bird, flying from their breeding grounds in the Arctic to their wintering grounds in Antarctica. This round-trip journey can exceed 44,000 miles. Shorebirds like the Bar-tailed Godwit also undertake impressive non-stop flights from Alaska to New Zealand, covering over 7,000 miles in one go.  Factors Influencing Migration  Several factors influence the decision of birds to migrate. One of the primary drivers is food availability. Birds that feed on insects or other resources that become scarce during winter are more likely to migrate to areas where food is plentiful. Breeding considerations also play a significant role in migration behavior. Birds migrate to breeding grounds where conditions are optimal for nesting and raising their young. Climate change has begun to impact bird migration patterns, with some species altering their routes and timing in response to shifting environmental conditions.  Navigation and Orientation  The ability of birds to navigate over long distances with precision is a subject that has captured the curiosity of scientists for centuries. Birds rely on a combination of cues such as the position of the sun and stars, Earth's magnetic field, landscape features, and even sense of smell to find their way during migration. Some species are known to use celestial cues to maintain their direction, while others have specialized magnetoreception mechanisms that help them detect the Earth's magnetic field. Recent research has also suggested that birds may possess internal maps of their migration routes.  Challenges and Risks  Migration is not without its challenges, and birds face a variety of risks during their journeys. One of the most significant hazards is habitat loss, as the destruction of stopover sites and nesting grounds can disrupt migration patterns and lead to population declines. Climate change poses another threat, affecting the availability of food and altering weather patterns along migratory routes. Collisions with human-made structures like buildings and communication towers also pose a danger to migrating birds, with millions of birds dying each year due to these collisions.  Conservation and Protection  Given the importance of bird migration for ecosystem health and biodiversity, conservation efforts are essential to protect migratory bird species. Initiatives such as creating protected areas along migration routes, conserving critical habitats, and raising awareness about the challenges faced by migratory birds are crucial steps in safeguarding these incredible creatures. International cooperation is key in addressing conservation challenges, as migratory birds often traverse multiple countries during their journeys.  Ecotourism and Bird Watching  Bird migration has also spurred the rise of ecotourism centered around bird watching. Observing migratory birds in their natural habitats has become a popular activity for nature enthusiasts and has economic benefits for local communities. Birding festivals and tours offer opportunities for people to experience the wonder of migration up close and learn about the importance of preserving habitats for future generations. Responsible ecotourism practices that prioritize bird conservation and sustainability can help promote the protection of migratory species.  In conclusion, bird migration is a remarkable display of nature's resilience and adaptability. The intricate patterns and behaviors exhibited by migratory birds highlight the complex relationships between species and their environments. By studying and understanding bird migration, we gain valuable insights into the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the importance of preserving habitats for all creatures. As we continue to navigate the challenges of a changing world, safeguarding the wonders of bird migration is essential for maintaining the rich tapestry of life on Earth.""","940"
"Darlington Richard","""His loss will amount in the aggregate, to about two thousand dollars, which will fall upon himself, as no assistance, up to the time of his repairing, had been rendered him. The track of the storm-cloud now extended along the southern side of Buck Run Valley, mounting the hill as it approached Stottsville, and cutting a road through the forest trees south of the buildings on the property of Mr. Thomas Hoffman. It then came down squarely into the valley, which turns abruptly to the right south of Stottsville, and struck the track of the Pomeroy and Delaware City Rail Road, removing the rails for a considerable distance; the substantial bridge that crosses Buck Run, near the same point, was then demolished, the water in the bed of the stream being raised up en masse by the whirl. The loss to the Rail Road Company is probably six hundred dollars. The storm, on its northern border, had caught the barn, orchard, etc., of a property owned by Dr. Murphy, of Parkesburg; it ran through a portion of his farm and did damage to the amount of six or seven hundred dollars. The next property that felt the fury of the hurricane as it proceeded in its course towards Ercildoun, is owned and managed by William Hamill, and is within the limits of East Fallowfield township. Here the storm-cloud widened to about three hundred yards, extending across the valley, running east and west through his farm, reaching his barn, and on its northern border, unroofing it and destroying the gable ends, inflicting a damage to the extent of three hundred dollars on the barn, and on the property itself of about twice that amount. We now approach the locality known as Newlin's Mills. These were not quite reached by the southern border of the storm track, but the timber tract of E. Phipps, a quarter of a mile north, was absolutely destroyed, and as the cloud poured into the valley that divides the properties of Mr. Phipps and Thos. Shields, a destruction of timber occurred that absolutely beggars description. Forest trees by the thousand were overthrown, many of which were broken off about half-way down the trunk, and others were uprooted; others again were twisted and interwoven in every conceivable shape. This mighty mass of material lies there to-day untouched, and thousands of people have visited the spot, amazed at the immense power which wind exerts when under the influence of rotary and progressive motion. Such a sight was never before seen in this latitude. In the valley that divides these tracts of timber, was a humble frame dwelling two stories high, occupied by a family of colored people named Hopkins. They heard the roaring of the storm as it approached from the west; the mother of the family, Mary Hopkins, rushed up stairs to close the windows, and as her hand was upon the sash, the house was overturned and the joists of the upper floor fell upon her, and she was found dead, having been crushed to death between the joists of the upper story and the rafters. The children below, or rather above her, as was the case at this time, were uninjured. This was the only person whose life was taken by the tornado, though a great number of narrow escapes was made. The loss sustained by Messrs. Phipps and Shields would amount to about twelve hundred dollars each. The entire amount of timber destroyed on these two properties, and also on the property of Joseph Brinton, south east of them, is about thirty acres. From some cause not fully explainable, the cloud of wind, after striking this forest tract, changed its course about eight deg. to the north, proceeding in a line south 3 deg. east, or nearly due east. This change brought the storm directly into the southern half of the village of Ercildoun, one mile distant. Before reaching that point, however, the property of Joseph Brinton had to be traveled over. His loss was heavy. His barn, carriage-house, and the north porch of his dwelling were destroyed; the house, from some cause, was not much injured. This was rather a strange circumstance, as the large trees on both sides of it were overthrown, and also the fences. There appeared to be two storm tracks at this point, but it was probably the same cloud that had divided for a few moments from some local cause. The hurricane also went through the orchard and wheat field on this property, destroying the trees, the whole of the wheat crop, and the fences in every direction. Mr. Brinton estimated his loss at twenty-five hundred dollars, and his estimate was not an extravagant one. I now come to that locality over which my own observation extended, and concerning which--'Haud ignota loquor'--I can speak with a good degree of accuracy. The southern half of the village of Ercildoun came next in the track of the storm-cloud. As this is the only village over which the tornado traveled, a brief description would not be inappropriate. This village contains about twenty dwellings. Twenty-five years ago it had considerable reputation as a manufacturing locality--large quantities of agricultural implements being made every year, and in addition a foundry was kept in full operation. It had at that time a daily mail, a valuable library, and many other attractions not then found in many villages of like size. Two Friends' Meeting Houses are located here, one in the centre and the other at the western extremity of the place. In the days when the anti-slavery agitation was beginning to rouse the people to a sense of the great evil of our country, and when it required something akin to heroism to feed and protect the fugitive slave on his road to the north, this little settlement of Friends did its whole duty in the cause of humanity, and was pretty widely known as a safe place for those fleeing from bondage. A public hall was erected in 847, and dedicated to free discussion. The motto, 'Let Truth and Error Grapple,' was emblazoned on its front in bold letters, and the lecturers and leading reformers of the day often held discussions there which would have been a credit to towns and villages of much greater pretensions. In 85/81 'Ercildoun Seminary for Young Men and Boys,' was established, with Smedley Darlington as Principal. It was a four-story structure, of good dimensions, and could accommodate about fifty pupils. As such, it was conducted for about three years, when the proprietor changed it to a boarding school for girls, and continued it thus for seven years, when it passed into the hands of its present proprietor, and afterwards was known as 'Ercildoun Seminary for Young Ladies,' and was kept in full operation to the present time. This Institution was remodeled in 870, and additional wings were added to it. Nearly two thousand pupils have received instruction here, and its patronage extended over a wide extent of country, including all the adjoining States, and many others. Almost unvarying success attended the school in its efforts to promote the cause of education. With this brief description of the place and of its leading features, it will now fall to my lot to tell the story of the terrible damage inflicted upon it by the great tornado of July st. My school had been vacated three days before, and all the pupils, together with their baggage, had gone. We felt, on that Sabbath afternoon, a full sense of relief from responsibility and care. About o'clock in the afternoon, while engaged in reading, I was informed by my wife that an unusual rumbling and loud noise could be heard in the west. I remarked that it must be a thunderstorm and nothing more. The loud roar, however, continued, and became clearer and more distinct. I arose hastily, took a position and listened to the sound. In a few moments my mother-in-law, who resides with us, called to me in a loud voice to come to the west window on the main hall of the second story. I hurried thither, and on looking toward the west saw the great storm-cloud approaching, distant at that time perhaps half a mile, and coming over the level plain of the intervening fields. It was a novel and terrible sight to behold. The great conical mass seemed to be carrying along with it the timbers and burning embers of a barn on fire; vast masses of dirt and other dark objects appeared to be also in motion and coming directly towards my school buildings. No time must be lost; the whole establishment might blow away, but in any event the safest place seemed to be the basement story. Thither I asked my family to go immediately; they did so. On reaching the story immediately above the basement I halted, passed to the front porch, and took a position for observation, thinking that possibly our plans for safety would have to be modified. In a few moments the cloud struck the building; it came apparently with the force of two or three batteries of artillery, and the question was about to be decided whether the brick walls could stand the shock; if they could not, our lives must be sacrificed. It was all over in less than one minute. I had withdrawn to a front room on the first heavy fall of brick through the porch roof, for the upper story seemed to be coming down bodily upon the lower floors. After it was over I stepped to the east end of that part of the porch which was remaining, and viewed the situation; it was enough to sadden the stoutest heart. Not a solitary building without was standing; the fourth story of the Seminary was completely gone. Our new dwelling house was in course of erection and was nearly completed. Although it was a large structure, thirty-six by fifty feet, not a vestige of it remained above the cellar walls; even these were partially overthrown. My barn, carriage-house and stable, together with every other out-building, were nowhere to be seen. Such a sight was never witnessed in this part of the country.""","""Destruction caused by tornado.""","2059","""Tornadoes are one of the most powerful and destructive forces of nature, capable of wreaking havoc and leaving a trail of devastation in their wake. These violent storms, characterized by rotating, funnel-shaped clouds extending from thunderstorms to the ground, are known for their ferocity and unpredictability. The destruction caused by tornadoes can be catastrophic, affecting entire communities and altering landscapes in a matter of minutes. Understanding the impact of tornadoes on both the physical environment and human lives is crucial in preparing for and mitigating the damage these storms can bring.  In terms of physical destruction, tornadoes can cause extensive damage to buildings, infrastructure, and natural habitats. The intense winds associated with tornadoes can reach speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour, easily tearing apart structures in their path. Homes, businesses, schools, and other buildings can be reduced to rubble within seconds, leaving behind debris scattered over large areas. The force of a tornado can uproot trees, overturn vehicles, and strip away topsoil, altering the physical landscape and causing environmental damage. In rural areas, tornadoes can destroy crops, livestock, and agricultural equipment, leading to significant economic losses for farmers and communities dependent on agriculture.  The aftermath of a tornado often presents a scene of chaos and devastation, with emergency response teams working tirelessly to search for survivors, provide medical assistance, and assess the extent of the damage. Entire neighborhoods may be left in ruins, with residents displaced and in need of shelter, food, and other essential services. Power outages, disrupted communication lines, and blocked roads can further complicate rescue and recovery efforts, hampering the ability of emergency services to reach those in need. The human toll of tornadoes can be staggering, with injuries ranging from minor cuts and bruises to life-threatening trauma, and unfortunately, fatalities are not uncommon in the most severe cases.  Communities affected by tornadoes must also grapple with the long-term consequences of the destruction. Rebuilding homes, businesses, and public infrastructure can take months, if not years, requiring significant financial resources and logistical coordination. Insurance claims, government assistance programs, and charitable donations may help alleviate some of the burden placed on individuals and communities, but the process of recovery can be slow and arduous. The emotional toll of losing loved ones, cherished possessions, and a sense of security can linger long after the physical damage has been repaired, leading to feelings of grief, anxiety, and uncertainty about the future.  In addition to the immediate physical and emotional impact of tornadoes, these storms can also have lasting effects on the environment. Deforestation, soil erosion, and changes in water quality are just some of the environmental consequences of tornadoes that can impact ecosystems and natural habitats. The destruction of trees and vegetation can disrupt wildlife habitats and decrease biodiversity, while soil erosion from intense winds and flooding can degrade agricultural land and pollute water sources. In some cases, tornadoes can trigger secondary disasters such as landslides, flash floods, or wildfires, compounding the environmental damage and posing further risks to human safety and well-being.  Given the destructive potential of tornadoes, preparedness and mitigation efforts are essential to minimizing the impact of these storms on communities and the environment. Early warning systems, such as tornado sirens, weather alerts, and mobile notifications, can provide crucial information to residents in the path of a storm, allowing them to seek shelter and take protective measures before it is too late. Emergency drills, community shelters, and designated safe rooms in homes and public buildings can offer sanctuary during a tornado, reducing the risk of injury and death.  Building codes, construction standards, and land-use planning regulations can also play a critical role in reducing the vulnerability of structures to tornado damage. Reinforced roofs, storm shutters, and secure foundations can make buildings more resilient to high winds and flying debris, while avoiding construction in floodplains or other high-risk areas can limit exposure to tornado hazards. Retrofitting older buildings, installing tornado-safe rooms, and incorporating green infrastructure into urban design can further enhance the ability of communities to withstand tornadoes and recover more quickly from their impact.  In conclusion, tornadoes are forces of nature that demand respect and preparedness from those living in regions prone to these storms. The destruction caused by tornadoes is vast and far-reaching, affecting not only physical infrastructure but also human lives, communities, and ecosystems. By understanding the impact of tornadoes and taking proactive steps to mitigate their effects, society can better protect itself against the devastation wrought by these powerful storms. While tornadoes may be unpredictable and uncontrollable, the ability to prepare, respond, and recover from their impact is within our grasp, offering hope for resilience in the face of nature's fury.""","942"
"Hurlbert William Henry","""But of all, the simplest, completest, and most authoritative in its lessons to the active mind of Northern Europe, is this on the foundation-stones of Amiens. Believe it or not as you will--only understand how thoroughly it was once believed--and that all beautiful things were made and all brave deeds done in the strength of it--until what we may call 'this present time,' in which it is gravely asked whether religion has any effect on morals, by have essentially no idea whatever of the meaning of either religion or morality.' VI. IN THE Where party names are taken from persons, there we may be sure that the people are either losing, or have never had, the political instincts which alone can make popular government a government of law and order. The Englishmen who are readiest to proclaim themselves 'Gladstonians,' whatever may be their other merits, are hardly perhaps the most devoted champions either of the British constitution as it is, or of strictly constitutional reform. In France to-day, the Republican party is made up of clans, each taking the name of its chief. There are Ferryists and Clementists, as there were Gambettists; and the Government of the day is putting forth all its strength to check the drift over of what I suppose I may without impropriety call the Republican residuum into Boulangism. Here in Amiens the tide seems to be too strong for the authorities at Paris, and for that matter throughout the department of the Somme. At the election nearly a year ago, on August 9, 888, of a deputy to fill the vacancy caused by the death of a Royalist member, M. de Berly, General Boulanger came forward as a candidate and was elected by an overwhelming majority. There are 60,00 electors in the department. Of these, 21,5/85/8 voted. General Boulanger received 6,94 votes, and his Republican competitor, M. Barnot, only 1,71, General Boulanger having been elected at the same time for the Nord and the Charente-Inferieure. General Boulanger resigned his seat and his Republican followers cast their votes for a Royalist, General de Montauban, who was elected. In the arrondissement of Amiens, with 7,27 registered voters, General Boulanger had a majority, in 888, of 5/8,74 voters, the whole vote thrown there being 2,09. Yet, in 881, on a total registration of 7,23 voters, the Republican candidates for Amiens, M. Goblet and M. Dieu, were elected by a combined majority of,94 votes. If the Boulangists carry Amiens, therefore, at the legislative election this year, it may be taken for granted, I think, that M. Goblet and his friend the senatorial mayor have not educated their fellow-citizens into very staunch and trustworthy supporters of the Republic. M. Fleury, the editor-in-chief of the Conservative Echo de la Somme, who made a pretty thorough canvass of the department before the election of August 9, 888, gives me some curious details as to that election. The monarchists, both royalists and imperialists, gave a general and tacit, and in many cases an overt and active, support to General Boulanger, their object being the same as his--to bring about a repeal of the existing law of 884, which was passed to prevent any real revision of the constitution in a sense hostile to the existing republican form of government. Of course if the people of the Somme had really cared anything about the Republic as a form of government, they ought to have defeated General Boulanger. It is the opinion of M. Fleury that the people of the Somme, and indeed of Picardy, not only care little or nothing about the Republic as a form of government, but actually and by a considerable majority prefer some monarchical form--probably, on the whole, the Empire. They are not in the least likely to express this preference at the polls, because, in common with the vast majority of the electors throughout France, they have been born and brought up to take their form of government from Paris. So long as the government at Paris--be it royal, imperial, or republican--controls the executive, the people of the provinces are extremely unlikely to make an emphatic effort of their own to be rid of that government. If Louis Philippe, in 848, would have allowed Marshal Bugeaud to use the force at his command in Paris, the Republic improvised in February of that year would have been strangled before birth, to the extreme satisfaction of an enormous majority of the French people. This was afterwards overwhelmingly shown by the election of Louis Napoleon, when General Cavaignac, with all the advantage of the control of the machinery of government at Paris, could secure only a relatively insignificant popular vote at the polls against the representative of the imperial monarchy. I spent the winter in Paris two years afterwards as a youth, during my first tour in Europe, and I there heard an American resident of Paris, well known at that time in the world of French politics, Mr. George Sumner, a brother of the senator from Massachusetts, relate in the salon of M. de Tocqueville a curious story of the days of February, which strikingly illustrates the disposition of the French provinces at that time to take whatever Paris might send them in the way either of administration or of revolution. The king refused to let the Marechal Duc d'Isly restore order (as there is no doubt he could easily and quickly have done), on the ground that he had received the Crown from the National Guard in Paris, and that he would not allow it to be defended by the line against them. The recently published letters of his very popular son, the Duc d'Orleans, prove that, had that prince been then living, he probably would never have allowed this scruple to stand in the way of averting a social and political catastrophe. But the duc was in his untimely grave, and the control of events fell most unexpectedly into the hands of a few men who had no concerted plan of action, and, indeed, hardly knew whether they were awake or dreaming. 'They proclaimed a republic,' said Mr. Sumner, 'because they did not know what else to do;' but they were in a state of utter bewilderment at first, as to how they should get the republic accepted by the provinces. A happy thought struck M. Armand Marrast. In those days the French railway system was little developed. Most of the mails from Paris were carried through the country by malles-postes and diligences, and every evening an immense number of these coaches left the central bureau for all parts of France. M. Marrast sent into all the quarters of Paris and impounded, in one way or another, the services and the paintpots of every house and furniture painter upon whom his people could lay hands. These were all set to work upon the mail coaches. The royal arms, with the Charter and the Crown, were painted over, and the vehicles which, from Paris, carried to all parts of France the news of the proclamation of the Republic carried everywhere also an outward and visible sign of the establishment of the new government in the words 'Republique Francaise' brightly blazoned upon their panels. I recalled this story to Mr. Sumner years afterwards in New York, and he assured me not only that it was literally correct, but that he had been consulted himself about it by M. Marrast at the time. This particular device could not now be used as effectively. But, with the telegraph wires and the telephones in its control, any government which may get itself installed to-morrow in Paris would certainly have tremendous odds in its favour, from one end of France to the other. The immense increase of the French public debt under the republican administration since 877 has correspondingly increased, all over France, the number of people known as petits rentiers, who, having invested their savings, in part or wholly, in the public securities, will be as quick to acquiesce in any revolution which they believe to have been successful at Paris, as they are slow to promote any revolution, no matter how desirable otherwise a change in the government may seem to them to be. So long as it is not shaken out of the public offices at Paris, the government of the Republic may probably count upon this vast body of quiet people, as confidently as the Empire counted upon it twenty years ago, or as the monarchy or the dictatorship might count upon it to-morrow, were the king or the dictator acclaimed in the capital. M. Fleury cites one of General Boulanger's most active supporters, M. Mermieix, as saying to him during the election in 888, 'with a few millions of francs, the liberty of the press and of public billsticking, and three thousand rowdies, I can change the government of this country in less than a year.' The remark is slightly cynical. But the extreme anxiety of the government of the Republic to get General Boulanger either into a prison or out of Paris certainly goes far to justify the boast of M. Mermeix. 'I told General Boulanger at Doullens,' said M. Fleury, after going thither in company with him from Amiens, 'that he was sure of his election. My reason was that while I saw little real enthusiasm for him at Amiens, none at all indeed among the middle classes, and no open display of any on the part of the workmen, I found the peasants for him almost to a man. They crowded about his railway carriage. They insisted on shaking hands with him, many of them kissed his hand (that ancient form of homage lingering still in their traditions), they fired off guns, and, above all, the women held up their children to be kissed by him. This settled the question for me. When I saw him kissing the little girls, I knew that he had captured the mammas, and the mammas govern the rural regions of Picardy.""","""French Politics and Popular Sentiment""","2106","""French politics is a dynamic and often tumultuous landscape that reflects the complex interplay of historical traditions, cultural values, and contemporary challenges. Understanding the nuances of French politics requires delving into the country's rich history, diverse political landscape, and the ever-evolving sentiments of its populace. From the lofty ideals of liberte, egalite, fraternite to the intricacies of modern-day policymaking, France continues to be a fascinating case study in the realm of politics.  At the heart of French politics lies the French Republic, a system of government that traces its roots back to the French Revolution of 1789. The principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, as enshrined in the national ethos, continue to influence the country's political discourse and policymaking. The French political system operates within the framework of a semi-presidential system, where power is divided between the President and the Prime Minister.  The President of France, often referred to as the """"chef de l'État"""" (head of state), wields significant power in foreign affairs, defense, and national security. The President is elected through a two-round system, with the candidate securing an absolute majority in the second round emerging as the victor. Recent Presidents, such as Emmanuel Macron and his predecessors like Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, have grappled with a range of domestic and international challenges during their terms in office.  On the other hand, the Prime Minister, known as the """"chef du gouvernement"""" (head of government), oversees domestic policy and administration. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and is responsible for implementing the government's agenda, managing parliament, and overseeing the day-to-day governance of the country. The Prime Minister leads the Council of Ministers, which comprises various government ministers responsible for different policy areas.  The French Parliament is bicameral, consisting of the National Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly, or """"Assemblée Nationale,"""" is the lower house of parliament and is directly elected by the people. It plays a crucial role in passing legislation, scrutinizing the government, and representing the interests of the French populace. The Senate, on the other hand, represents regional and local interests and acts as a revising chamber, reviewing and amending legislation proposed by the National Assembly.  Political parties in France span the ideological spectrum, ranging from the center-left to the far-right. Major parties include La République En Marche, the center-right Les Républicains, the far-right Rassemblement National (formerly Front National), the center-left Parti Socialiste, and the far-left La France Insoumise. In addition to these traditional parties, smaller parties and independent candidates also play a role in shaping the political landscape.  French politics is not only defined by formal institutions and processes but also by the sentiments and attitudes of the French populace. Public opinion in France is shaped by a myriad of factors, including historical events, cultural values, economic conditions, and social movements. The French people are known for their strong sense of civic engagement and political activism, as evidenced by frequent protests, strikes, and demonstrations on a wide range of issues.  One of the key issues that has dominated French politics in recent years is the question of identity and national cohesion. Debates around immigration, multiculturalism, secularism, and French values have sparked intense discussions and divisions within society. The rise of populist and nationalist movements, such as the Rassemblement National, reflects a growing discontent with the status quo and a desire for change among certain segments of the population.  Economic concerns also play a significant role in shaping public sentiment in France. High unemployment rates, economic inequality, and a sense of social dislocation have fueled frustration and discontent among many French citizens. The government's response to economic challenges, such as job creation, tax reform, and social welfare policies, often becomes a focal point of political debate and public discourse.  Furthermore, France's role in the European Union and its global position on issues such as climate change, security, and human rights also influence public sentiment and political decision-making. The French people have a history of being deeply engaged in international affairs and often hold strong opinions on France's role in the world.  In conclusion, French politics and popular sentiment are deeply intertwined, reflecting a complex interplay of historical legacies, institutional structures, and societal dynamics. From the lofty ideals of the French Revolution to the everyday struggles of modern-day governance, France continues to navigate a challenging political landscape shaped by competing ideologies, diverse interests, and the ever-evolving aspirations of its citizens. As France moves forward, it will be crucial for its political leaders to listen to the voices of the people, address their concerns, and work towards a future that upholds the principles of liberte, egalite, fraternite for all.""","967"
"Lindsay Anna Robertson Brown","""When we hold our baby in our arms, we do not say, My child, be good for nothing! Neither does God say, Be nothing, do nothing! Just exist as humbly and meekly as you can! He says, 'Quit you like men!' Each of us is born for a sceptre and a crown. It gives a strange new thrill to life, to realize that we may be just as ambitious as we please, that we may long earnestly for high things, and work for them, if our inmost desire is not for self but for God. This new idea of ambition should be at the root of education and of religious teaching. Piety is not a namby-pamby sentiment; it is a great intellectual force. Desire is architectural: our dreams should be of prestige and power. True ambition is the reaching-out of the soul toward preordained things. What else is the meaning of our love for excellence, our insatiable yearning for perfection? 'What is excellent,' says Emerson, 'is permanent.' To excel in any work is to combine in that work the most enduring qualities of human labor; to excel in any place is to shine forth with the great qualities of the race. Hence, ambition has a rightful place. The power of a king is the power of control. All about us are moving the great forces of the universe--physical, intellectual, moral, spiritual. What we can do with them is a test of our power. Life is in many ways a majestic trial of one's power to command. Three men buy adjoining tracts of land. One man mines coal upon his acres. He amasses wealth and influence because he is in control of the Carboniferous age and the human need of light and heat. The second man tills his ground and raises wheat and corn. He is in command of living nature--of the rotation of seasons, of wind, frost, rain; he uses them to provide food for those that hunger and must be fed. The third man lies under the trees. He digs no mine. He plants and reaps no corn and grain. He simply lies under the trees, gazes into the sky and dreams. Men call him idle, but he is not so. One day he writes a book. It lives a thousand years. His control is over the spirit of man. He has entered into its hopes and sorrows, its aspirations and its dreams. This story is a Parable of Kings. Such is the power of control that is granted to each new soul. Each child is bequeathed at birth a sceptre and a crown. The first rule is parental. The primitive monarchy is in the home. A young baby cries. The trained nurse turns on the light, lifts the baby, hushes it, sings to it, rocks it, and stills its weeping by caresses and song. When next the baby is put down to sleep, more cries, more soothing and disturbance, and the setting of a tiny instinct which shall some day be will--the power of control. The grandmother arrives on the scene. When baby cries, she plants the little one firmly in its crib, turns down the light, pats and soothes the tiny restless hands that fight the air, watches, waits. From the crib come whimpers, angry cries, yells, sobs, baby snarls and sniffles that die away in a sleepy infant growl. Silence, sleep, repose, and the building of life and nerve and muscle in the quiet and the darkness. The baby has been put in harmony with the laws of nature--the invigoration of fresh air, sleep, stillness--and the little one wakens and grows like a fresh, sweet rose. The mother, looking on, learns of the ways of God with men. Firmness is the true gentleness. There is a form of authority which must be as implacable as the divine decree. Mercy is the requiring of obedience to law; it is not a cajoling training in law-defiance, which shall one day break the mother's heart and upset the social relations of the world. The next rule is personal: the direction of one's own energy in the way of one's own will. The child moves his hands, his feet; he turns his rattle up and down, and shakes it about. He discovers that he can pull things toward him and push them away; that he can reach things that are higher than his head. He begins to creep. He touches things that are the other side of the world from him, that is, across the room. He plucks fibres from the rug or carpet; swallows straws, buttons, and little strings. He pounds, and sets up vibrations of pleasant noise; he clashes ten-pins, he blows his whistle, squeezes his rubber horse and man, rattles the newspaper, flings about his bottle and his blocks. He feels himself a self-directing power, and at times asserts this power against the will of those who would make him do what he does not want to do. The love of rule is in him, and he lays his little hands on power. Education determines whether this power shall be for good or for evil. We cannot take away power from any child--he shall move the affairs of nations--but we can direct this love of power, or crush it; strengthen it, or weaken it; turn it toward the highest help of man, or deflect it to tyranny, cruelty, and crime. Child-training is guidance in the way of God's decrees. It is not the setting of one's own ideas upon a little child; it is not the gratification of one's own love of power; it is not the satisfaction of one's own self-conceit. It is a firm, humble striving to carry on the harmony of the universe: to bring up the child to love order, justice, mercy, and truth. Education is the teaching of how to direct energy for the universal good. It lays hold of a child and, out of his destructive instincts--the instinct to bang, and pull, and tear to pieces--it develops creative power, the inventive genius that lies hid within him. It takes the pure love of noise, and trains it to pitches, harmonies, intervals, and makes a musician of the boy who used to whack his spoon. It takes the alphabet and the early pothooks, and the boy by and by combines them into literature. The apples and the peaches which he is taught to exchange justly are by and by transmuted into trade and commerce. He brings cargoes from Cuba and Ceylon, trades with Japan and Hawaii, and the Asiatic isles. The energy of block-building is developed into sculpture, architecture, and civil engineering. The stamping of his foot in anger is directed to determination, perseverance, the rule of the brave spirit, the unconquerable will. Nothing is more marvellous than this grave upbuilding. The next rule is social: the direction of personal energy that shall leave a distinct impress on other lives. It is long before we realize that for each exertion we are responsible; that what we do is held against us in strict account, not only by fate, which builds our destiny for us out of our own deeds, but by every other person with whom we come in contact. Our fellows check off daily against us so much vitality, so much magnanimity, so much idleness, cruelty, spite, goodness, selfishness, meanness, or loving-kindness. Life holds a record of our every deed, and from no least responsibility can we make our escape. We are the prisoners of events which we ourselves have brought about. The discipline of ethics, of home-training, of the Church, and of religious teaching is addressed fundamentally to this social consciousness of ours, this responsibility which we cannot evade. To bear rule aright is to go forth into the world to build up, in authority, talent, and influence, the kingdom of God.. There is the agricultural phase of social rule. A man tills a farm. It has upon it trees, streams, woodland, and meadow-land. He may rule--to what end? If he rules it for his own personal ends--merely to fill his granaries, and lay up gold--he rules it for miserliness, with a sort of thrift that is as passing in inheritance as the flying April rain. Or he may say: I will keep my land in trust for God. I will hold rain and frost, heat and cold, storm and sun, in fee simple for the race. My grain shall pass out into the world's mart, sent forth with love and prayer. Such a farmer is the incarnation of moral grandeur. Let men laugh, if they will, at his overalls and plough, his wide-brimmed hat, his simple manners, and his homely, racy speech. His feet are by the furrow, but his heart is in heaven, and his treasure is there also. Says the author of Nine Acres on the Hillside, 'The agriculturist walks side by side with the Creator.' There is a fine integrity which lies in land. There is a resolution which is concerned with crops. There is a wisdom born of wind and weather. There is a power which comes from the constant revival of life in seed and fruit and flower. This man is King of God's Acres. Let him not despise his kingdom, and may the succession not depart from his house!. There is a rule which is industrial. A man is sent into the world to wield a hammer, a saw, and run an engine. If his rule over his hammer is weak, if he does not know how to use it well, if its blow is uncertain and its result unskilled, then he passes from the line of kings, and is subject, instead of in authority, in his own domain. He is captive to a piece of steel or wood. So with every tool of trade. Each man who conquers his tool is a ruler--is in control of elements of human happiness and good. The roof-mender, the furnace-builder, the cloth-weaver, the yarn-spinner, the steel-worker, the miller--do not these all keep the race warmed, and clad, and fed?. The next rule is commercial. Trade itself is neither menial nor demeaning. Rightly used, it is a high form of control. People have things to buy and things to sell. The maker is handicapped. He cannot travel elsewhere to dispose of what he has. The buyer is ignorant. He does not know where to go, or cannot go, at first-hand, for the shoes, the hat, the reaper, the bricks, the lumber, the stationery which he must use. There appears upon the scene the man of observation, of investigation, of capital, of shrewdness, of resources. With one hand he gathers the products of the Pacific and of the South Seas. With the other, he takes the output of the Atlantic seaboard, the Gulf States, the Mississippi valley, the northern lakes and hills.""","""Ambition and personal power development""","2295","""Ambition and Personal Power Development  Ambition is the driving force that propels individuals to strive for success, achieve their goals, and fulfill their potential. It is the inner desire to pursue and accomplish something significant, whether in one's career, personal life, or any other aspect of their existence. Ambition fuels motivation, determination, and resilience, pushing individuals to push beyond their limits and reach for greater heights. However, ambition alone is not enough to ensure success; it must be accompanied by the development of personal power – the ability to influence oneself and others positively to achieve desired outcomes.  Personal power encompasses a range of capabilities, including self-awareness, emotional intelligence, assertiveness, resilience, and leadership skills. It involves understanding one's strengths and weaknesses, managing emotions effectively, setting boundaries, bouncing back from setbacks, and inspiring and motivating others. Developing personal power is crucial for harnessing ambition effectively and turning aspirations into actual achievements. Let us delve deeper into the significance of ambition and personal power development, exploring how they intertwine to drive success and personal growth.  Ambition serves as the initial spark that ignites the fire of personal growth and achievement. It is the vision that stirs excitement, spurs action, and generates momentum towards one's goals. Ambitious individuals often set high standards for themselves, constantly seeking to improve and challenge their capabilities. They are driven by a sense of purpose and a relentless pursuit of excellence, refusing to settle for mediocrity. Ambition pushes individuals out of their comfort zones, encouraging them to take risks, learn from failures, and persist in the face of obstacles.  While ambition provides the fuel for success, personal power acts as the engine that drives individuals towards their objectives. Developing personal power involves cultivating self-awareness, which enables individuals to recognize their values, beliefs, strengths, and limitations. Self-awareness allows individuals to leverage their strengths effectively, mitigate their weaknesses, and make informed decisions that align with their goals and values. It also entails emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage one's emotions and navigate interpersonal relationships with empathy and authenticity.  Another essential aspect of personal power is assertiveness – the ability to communicate needs, boundaries, and opinions confidently and respectfully. Assertive individuals express themselves clearly, stand up for their rights, and advocate for their interests without being aggressive or passive. Assertiveness is essential for setting boundaries, establishing healthy relationships, and asserting oneself in various personal and professional contexts. It empowers individuals to speak their truth, defend their viewpoints, and engage in constructive dialogue with others.  Resilience is another hallmark of personal power, enabling individuals to bounce back from adversity, setbacks, and challenges. Resilient individuals view failures as opportunities for growth, learn from their experiences, and adapt to change effectively. They maintain a positive outlook, cultivate perseverance, and embrace challenges as stepping stones to success. Resilience is crucial for sustaining motivation, overcoming obstacles, and staying committed to long-term goals despite inevitable setbacks along the way.  Leadership skills are also integral to personal power development, as they enable individuals to influence, inspire, and empower others towards shared goals. Effective leaders exhibit vision, empathy, communication skills, and the ability to motivate and engage diverse individuals towards a common purpose. Leadership involves inspiring trust, fostering collaboration, and instilling a sense of purpose and direction within teams and organizations. Developing leadership skills enhances one's ability to harness ambition effectively, mobilize resources, and lead by example in pursuit of collective success.  The synergy between ambition and personal power is evident in the success stories of renowned leaders, entrepreneurs, and change-makers who have made a lasting impact on society. These individuals possess a clear vision, unwavering determination, and a strong sense of purpose that drive them towards audacious goals and transformative achievements. They leverage their personal power – including self-awareness, emotional intelligence, resilience, assertiveness, and leadership skills – to channel their ambition effectively and make a meaningful difference in the world.  To cultivate ambition and develop personal power, individuals can engage in various practices and strategies that enhance their self-awareness, emotional intelligence, assertiveness, resilience, and leadership capabilities. These may include mindfulness meditation, journaling, self-reflection, emotional self-regulation techniques, communication workshops, conflict resolution training, leadership development programs, and mentoring relationships with experienced professionals. By investing in personal growth and development, individuals can unlock their full potential, amplify their ambition, and wield their personal power to create positive change in their lives and communities.  In conclusion, ambition and personal power development are intertwined forces that drive individuals towards success, fulfillment, and personal growth. Ambition provides the vision and motivation to pursue lofty goals, while personal power equips individuals with the skills, mindset, and abilities to navigate challenges, influence outcomes, and lead effectively. By cultivating self-awareness, emotional intelligence, assertiveness, resilience, and leadership skills, individuals can harness their ambition effectively and leverage their personal power to achieve exceptional results. As individuals strive to reach their full potential, embracing ambition and personal power development can be a transformative journey towards realizing their aspirations and making a lasting impact in the world.""","1027"
"Bernstorff Johann Heinrich Graf von","""If, after such a pause in the submarine war and the establishment of a really clear diplomatic situation, Mr. Wilson failed us and made no positive progress either with regard to his programme for the 'Freedom of the Seas' or the conclusion of peace, we should have held quite a different position from which--if we really thought it desirable--to reopen unrestricted submarine warfare. We had always made the mistake of dealing in half-hearted concessions. In my opinion it was essential for us to strive for a complete understanding with America if we were not prepared to carry on the submarine campaign without regard to consequences. No attention was paid to my suggestion in Berlin at the time. Admiral von Tirpitz had just resigned and the decision had been taken against the continuance of unrestricted submarine warfare. I do not know why the dispatch of an official Note was preferred to the oral negotiations I had suggested, but I think that the deciding factor was consideration for public opinion in Germany. A few days later I cabled the following to Berlin: IN 'Washington, th April, 916. 'House gave me a very gloomy view of the position with regard to the Sussex. At the White House the situation is regarded as hopeless because the view is held that, in spite of Tirpitz's resignation, the German Government, with the best will in the world, cannot curb the submarine campaign. It has hitherto been merely due to good luck that no American has lost his life and any moment might precipitate a crisis which would be bound to lead to a break. The American Government are convinced that the Sussex was torpedoed by a German submarine. A repetition of such mistakes would be bound to drive the United States of America into war with us, which Wilson would greatly regret, as he is anxious--as I have already reported--to lay the foundations of peace in a few months. If the United States were drawn into the war all hope of an early peace would be at an end. 'I request to be furnished with instructions on the basis of which I can pacify the Government here, which now has doubts of our bona fides.' After Mr. Gerard, apart from other questions concerning doubtful cases of torpedoing, had also submitted a similar inquiry to the Foreign Office on the subject of the Sussex incident, an official reply was handed to him on the 0th April which read in the following terms: 'A decision as to whether the Channel steamer Sussex was damaged by a German submarine or not is made extraordinarily difficult owing to the fact that no exact information is known as to the place, time and accompanying circumstances of the sinking, and moreover a picture of this ship could not be obtained until the th April. Consequently the inquiry has had to be extended to all submarine enterprises which took place on the day in question, 4th March, in the Channel anywhere on the course between Folkestone and Dieppe. 'In this area on the 4th March, in the middle of the English Channel, a long, black vessel, flying no flags, with a gray funnel, small gray superstructure and two high masts was hit by a German submarine. The German captain was definitely convinced that she was a ship of war, and indeed a mine-layer of the newly-built English Arabic class. He was led to this conviction: '. By the flush deck of the ship. '. By the shape of the stern, which sloped outwards. '. By the paintwork, which was that of a ship of war. '. By the high speed of about eighteen knots which the ship developed, '. By the fact that the ship was not steering the course north of the light buoys between Dungeness and Beachy Head within which frequent observation had led the German submarines to keep a look out for merchant shipping, but was in mid-Channel, heading almost for Le Havre. 'Consequently, the submarine fired a torpedo at.5/8 p.m. Central European time, - knots southeast of the Bull Rock. The torpedo struck, and so heavy an explosion occurred that the whole of the ship forward of the bridge broke away. The unusually heavy explosion leaves no doubt that there were large stores of ammunition on board. 'The German captain has prepared a sketch of the ship he attacked, of which two copies are sent herewith. The two copies of pictures of the Sussex, also enclosed, were photographed from the English newspaper The Daily Graphic, of the 7th inst. A comparison of the sketches and the photograph shows that the vessel attacked is not identical with the Sussex; particularly striking is the difference in the position of the funnel and the shape of the stern. No other attack was made by a German submarine on the course between Folkestone and Dieppe at the time of the Sussex incident. 'From this the German Government are obliged to assume that the sinking of the Sussex is to be set down to other causes than attack by a German submarine. Some light may be thrown on the incident by the fact that on the st and nd April alone no less than twenty-six English mines were destroyed in the Channel by German naval forces. In general the whole of that area is rendered dangerous by drifting mines and not torpedoes. Off the English coast the Channel is also made increasingly dangerous by German mines which have been laid for the enemy naval forces. 'If the American Government should have at their disposal any further data that may help to elucidate the Sussex incident, the German Government beg that it may be communicated to them so that they may subject it to examination. In the event of differences of opinion arising between the two Governments the German Government now declare themselves ready to submit the whole incident to an International Commission in accordance with the third clause of the 'Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes of the 8th October, 907.' I have reproduced this Note in full because its influence was quite particularly fateful and because it was probably the most unfortunate document that ever passed from Berlin to Washington. Mr. Wilson thought he detected a direct untruth, and the mixture of an uneasy conscience and clumsiness which the German Note appeared to betray prompted the sharp tone of the President's reply. For the sake of his prestige Mr. Wilson was now compelled by the recent course of events to take action, although the excitement of public opinion was this time undoubtedly less than was the case after the torpedoing of the Lusitania and the Arabic. The American Government, therefore, couched the Note which they dispatched on the 8th April in the terms of an ultimatum. In the meantime, the discovery in the hull of the Sussex of a piece of a German torpedo placed the matter beyond all doubt. Additional importance was given to the ultimatum by the fact that before dispatching it Mr. Wilson laid it personally before Congress at a special sitting. It is my firm conviction that had it not been for this ultimatum diplomatic relations would not have been broken off immediately, even in 917. In the increased tension of the situation resulting from the exchange of Notes on the subject of the Sussex I see, therefore, one of the immediate germs of the war with America. After this exchange of Notes a challenge in the form of our formal declaration of the 1st January, 917, could no longer be tolerated. The clumsiness of such formal declarations was, as I have said, only surpassed by the regrettable impression of a juristic argument produced by our first Lusitania Note. As the American ultimatum later formed the basis on which the American Government, immediately after the declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare, broke off diplomatic relations, I here give the vital contents of the American Note of the 8th April verbatim: 'Again and again the Imperial Government has given its solemn assurances to the Government of the United States that at least passenger ships would not be dealt thus with, and yet it has repeatedly permitted its undersea commanders to disregard those assurances with entire impunity. As recently as February last it gave notice that it would regard all armed merchantmen owned by its enemies as part of the armed naval forces of its adversaries, and deal with them as with men-of-war, thus, at least by implication, pledging itself to give warning to vessels which were not armed and to accord security of life to their passengers and crews; but even this limitation their submarine commanders have recklessly ignored. 'The Government of the United States has been very patient. At every stage of this distressing experience of tragedy after tragedy it has sought to be governed by the most thoughtful consideration of the extraordinary circumstances of an unprecedented war, and to be guided by sentiments of very genuine friendship for the people and Government of Germany. It has accepted the successive explanations and assurances of the Imperial Government as of course given in entire sincerity and good faith, and has hoped, even against hope, that it would prove to be possible for the Imperial Government so to order and control the acts of its naval commanders as to square its policy with the recognized principles of humanity as embodied in the law of nations. It has made every allowance for unprecedented conditions and has been willing to wait until the facts became unmistakable and were susceptible of only one interpretation.""","""Unrestricted submarine warfare and diplomacy""","1858","""Unrestricted submarine warfare is a military strategy that involves submarines attacking enemy vessels without warning, following no rules of engagement, often leading to a high degree of civilian casualties. This controversial tactic has been employed in various conflicts throughout history, notably during World War I and World War II.  During World War I, the German Empire notably utilized unrestricted submarine warfare as a means to cripple the British economy by targeting merchant ships bringing supplies to the United Kingdom. The most infamous incident during this period was the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915, a British passenger liner carrying both civilians and war materials. The attack resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,200 people, including 128 Americans. This event played a significant role in turning public opinion against Germany and eventually led to the United States joining the war on the side of the Allies.  The use of unrestricted submarine warfare resurfaced during World War II, primarily by German and Japanese forces. The German U-boats, or submarines, targeted Allied shipping lanes in the Atlantic, leading to substantial losses for the Allies. This tactic was part of the larger strategy of disrupting supply lines and isolating the United Kingdom. The Battle of the Atlantic became a crucial theater of the war, with convoys escorted by warships and aircraft facing off against the U-boats.  In the Pacific theater, the Japanese also employed unrestricted submarine warfare against Allied ships, particularly targeting American vessels. The attack on Pearl Harbor further escalated tensions and brought the United States into World War II. Japanese submarines became known for their stealth and effectiveness, inflicting significant damage on Allied naval forces. Submarine warfare played a vital role in the overall strategies of both the Axis and Allied powers during the conflict.  The use of unrestricted submarine warfare raised ethical and moral concerns due to its indiscriminate nature. The targeting of civilian ships, often with non-combatants aboard, led to widespread condemnation and accusations of war crimes. The rules of engagement and international laws regarding warfare were tested and debated in the face of such tactics. The Geneva Conventions and other agreements aimed to establish protocols for the humane conduct of warfare were challenged by the brutal reality of submarine attacks on civilian vessels.  Diplomacy played a crucial role in addressing the challenges posed by unrestricted submarine warfare. In both World War I and World War II, diplomatic efforts were made to mitigate the impact of these tactics. The United States, in particular, used diplomacy to condemn and counter these actions. President Woodrow Wilson's pursuit of a peaceful resolution during World War I was complicated by the German use of unrestricted submarine warfare. His eventual decision to enter the war was influenced by the sinking of the Lusitania and the violation of American neutrality.  During World War II, diplomatic initiatives aimed at addressing the issue of unrestricted submarine warfare included agreements like the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which sought to limit naval armaments and uphold maritime law. However, these efforts were often overshadowed by the escalating hostilities and the brutal reality of war. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) later established guidelines for the conduct of naval warfare, including the treatment of civilians and the prohibition of unrestricted submarine warfare.  In conclusion, unrestricted submarine warfare has been a contentious strategy used in armed conflicts, causing significant loss of life and challenging the laws and norms of warfare. The impact of this tactic on civilians and neutrals, as well as its role in shaping diplomatic efforts during times of war, highlights the complex interplay between military strategy, ethics, and international relations. While this tactic has been employed in the past, efforts to uphold legal and ethical standards in warfare continue to evolve, aiming to prevent the indiscriminate targeting of non-combatants and preserve the principles of humanity in times of conflict.""","755"
"Bradley John William","""The ten German circles of Suabia and Franconia, Westphalia, Bohemia, and the rest did not as yet exist--they were the later creation of Maximilian; the Fatherland consisted of some two or three hundred dukedoms, counts, marquisates, and lordships, all absolute sovereignties, but all pledged to support the Holy Roman Empire. Very thinly, perhaps, but still the Imperial sceptre meant a real supremacy, and in the hands of such emperors as Henry of Luxembourg, a supremacy maintained with real and becoming dignity. Prag, as we have said, is in a Slavonic country, and one sometimes hostile to the Empire. It was the capital of Bohemia. In 310 its King was John, the restless son of the new Emperor Henry VII. of Luxembourg. Hence we find it at the moment we begin the study of its art a nominally German city. Shortly before this time were produced several examples of German work; as, for instance, the 'Minnelieder,' with more than a hundred miniatures of hunting scenes and similar outdoor amusements, which are useful as studies of costume, but otherwise of little interest. But it is not until 312--the new King being then, for the sake of acquiring the crown, though only, it is said, thirteen years of age, already the husband of the Princess Elizabeth, the late King's second daughter, yet neither a favourite with his wife nor with her father's people--that the Abbess of St. George's in Prag, the Princess Cunigunda, composed a Passionale, richly illustrated with interesting miniatures. The saints, histories, and allegories are painted in tender water-colours, the architectural details being in Gothic taste. It is still preserved in the University Library at Prag, No. xiv., A. 7. The Emperor Charles IV., son of the valorous but impracticable 'Pontificale of Bishop Albert von Sternberg' (in the library of the Prmonstrant Monastery of Strahow)--the Missal of Archbishop Ozko von Evangeliary of Canon John von, it may be said, typical. Of these the grandest, though incomplete, is the illuminated Bible, called the Wenzel Bible, executed by order of Martin Rotlow for presentation to the Emperor. The choice of illustrations in this singular performance are rather more than on a par with the woodcuts of the great English Bible of Cranmer. The 'Wilhelm von Oranse' of 387, now in the Ambras Museum at of the Bohemian type. Now and then a MS. will show the influence of Westphalian treatment of foliage--and, again, of the school of Cologne or Nuremberg or Augsburg. These all differ, whilst still keeping an unmistakable German character. The Hildesheimer Prayer-book at Berlin points to Cologne. The Frankendorfer Evangeliary at Nuremberg is characteristic of that city. The Choir-book of St. Ulrich and Afra in their abbey at Augsburg is typical of its locality. The Missal of Sbinco, Archbishop of Prag, inclines to Nuremberg rather than Prag (Imp. Lib., Vienna, No. 844). It is eighty years earlier than the Augsburg and Hildesheim MSS. Passing actively onwards, we find illumination still in vogue in the sixteenth century, notwithstanding that Germany was the cradle of the printing press. In fact, it seems to wax more and more sumptuous--the books more profusely ornamented than ever. The Missal and Prayer-book of Albert of Brandenburg, Archbishop of Mainz, once at Aschaffenburg, executed about 5/824 are among the finest productions of the illuminator's art. While perhaps we may complain that design has given way to profusion and the border flowers and insects--a contemporary characteristic of Netherlandish art also--are neither more nor less than portraiture applied to flowers, fruits, and the insect world. The larger miniatures are modern paintings, including portraits, differing in nothing but dimensions from the works of the greatest masters of the schools of painting. In ignorance of the strict rules of the gilds, some writers have gone so far as to say that miniatures also such as these were the work of the Van Eycks, the Memlings, and the Lucas van Leydens of our public galleries. This particular MS. was the work of a famous Nuremberg miniaturist, one of a distinguished family of artists--Nicolas Glockendon. A very similar, but perhaps still richer, MS., is the Prayer-book of William of Bavaria, still kept in the Imperial Library at Vienna (No. 880), painted by Albert Glockendon. It is one of the most exquisite volumes possibly to be met with. A Prayer-book in the British Museum (Add. 75/825/8), though far inferior, may give some idea of the sumptuous character of the Glockendon work. The first Archbishop of Prag, Arnestus or Ernest von Pardubitz, was an industrious collector of MSS. and employed many scribes. Another of the famous patrons in Prag was Gerhard Groot, who employed one of the best penmen to copy St. John Chrysostom's Commentary on St. Matthew. In 383 he founded at Deventer the famous House of the Brothers of the Common Life, who made a business of transcribing books; and, indeed, so profitably, that, for instance, Ian van Enkhuisen of Zwolle received five hundred golden gulden for a Bible. On account of the goose-quill which the brothers wore in their hats, they were familiarly known as the Brethren of the Pen. Wattenbach, Schriftwesen im Mittelalter, p. 64. VIII What is meant by the Netherlands--Early realism and study of nature--Combination of symbolism with imitation--Anachronism in design--The value of the pictorial methods of the old illuminators--The oldest Netherlandish MS.--Harlinda and Renilda--The nunnery at Maas-Eyck--Description of the MS.--Thomas a Kempis--The school of Zwolle--Character of the work--The use of green landscape backgrounds--The Dukes of Burgundy--Netherlandish artists--No miniatures of the Van Eycks or Memling known to exist--Schools of Bruges, Ghent, Liege, etc.--Brussels Library--Splendid Netherlandish MSS. at Vienna--Gerard David and the Grimani Breviary--British Museum--'Romance of the Rose'--'Isabella' Breviary--Grisailles. In speaking of the Netherlands we have to bear in mind that some portions of what are now called the Netherlands were once parts of Germany, while others were parts of France. In the thirteenth century Netherlandish art was simply a variety either of Northern German or Northern French. The earlier schools of Flanders and Hainaut, and perhaps of Brabant, belong rather to France, while Holland, Limburg, Luxembourg, and the Rhine districts were more inclined towards Germany. But as soon as the schools of Ghent and Bruges and other Burgundian centres began to assert their claims, it was speedily apparent that they had an individuality of their own. In no country had the study of nature a more direct influence on the character of illumination. The allegorical method which so long had characterised both French and German art was promptly abandoned, and direct realism both in figure and landscape became the prevailing characteristic.""","""German Art and Manuscript Illumination""","1603","""German art and manuscript illumination have played significant roles in shaping the cultural and artistic landscape of Europe. With a rich history rooted in creativity, innovation, and craftsmanship, German art showcases a unique blend of tradition and experimentation that continues to captivate audiences around the world.  During the medieval period, manuscript illumination flourished in Germany as in other parts of Europe. Illuminated manuscripts were meticulously crafted books adorned with intricate designs, elaborate initials, and miniature illustrations. German artists, known for their attention to detail and technical skill, produced some of the most exquisite illuminated manuscripts of the time.  One of the most renowned examples of German manuscript illumination is the """"Carolingian Renaissance"""" manuscripts, produced during the rule of Charlemagne in the 8th and 9th centuries. These manuscripts were characterized by their distinctive script, elaborate decorations, and vibrant colors. The Lorsch Gospels, a masterpiece of Carolingian art, exemplifies the fusion of Germanic and Romanesque influences in manuscript illumination.  As the Middle Ages progressed, German manuscript illumination evolved, reflecting the changing artistic styles and influences of the time. The Gothic period saw the emergence of richly decorated manuscripts such as the Codex Manesse, a collection of medieval poetry featuring intricate illustrations and ornate borders. German artists demonstrated their mastery of the art form through their skillful use of gold leaf, vibrant pigments, and delicate line work.  The Renaissance period brought new artistic techniques and perspectives to German art and manuscript illumination. Artists like Albrecht Dürer and Lucas Cranach the Elder embraced humanism and realism, creating works that reflected the cultural and intellectual developments of the time. Illuminated manuscripts from this period combined traditional decorative elements with a renewed interest in classical motifs and naturalism.  During the Baroque era, German art experienced a period of opulence and grandeur, characterized by elaborate ornamentation and dramatic compositions. Manuscript illumination during this time reflected the ornate aesthetics of the Baroque style, featuring intricate borders, dynamic compositions, and rich color palettes. The Würzburg Residence, a prime example of Baroque architecture and art, exemplifies the grandiose and elaborate nature of German artistic expression in the 17th and 18th centuries.  In the 19th and 20th centuries, German art underwent significant transformations influenced by movements such as Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, and Bauhaus. Artists like Caspar David Friedrich, Emil Nolde, and Wassily Kandinsky pushed the boundaries of artistic expression, exploring themes of emotion, individualism, and abstraction. While manuscript illumination evolved with the advent of printing presses and new technologies, its legacy lived on through the preservation and study of historical illuminated manuscripts.  Today, German art continues to thrive, with contemporary artists exploring diverse mediums, styles, and concepts. From traditional forms like painting and sculpture to avant-garde installations and digital art, German artists push the boundaries of creativity and innovation. Manuscript illumination, though no longer a widespread practice, remains an essential part of art history, inspiring contemporary artists and scholars to study and appreciate its enduring beauty and craftsmanship.  In conclusion, German art and manuscript illumination have left an indelible mark on the artistic heritage of Europe. From the intricate illuminations of medieval manuscripts to the bold experiments of modern art, German artists have contributed to a rich tapestry of creativity and expression. Through their meticulous craftsmanship, innovative techniques, and creative vision, German artists have shaped and enriched the cultural landscape, leaving a legacy that continues to inspire and captivate audiences across the globe.""","715"
"Harner Michael J ","""The four handled jugs fall into two classes: d and e, medium; f and g, high. In the former, the height is about a tenth greater than the mouth diameter, in the latter, about a half greater. Also, in the medium jugs, the base of the handle springs from the lower half of the vessel; in the high ones, from the middle or above. In all cases the handle rises somewhat above the lip. The neck is less than the mouth by 2 to 5/8 per cent. The cups are like the jugs except that they are lower and the main painted designs come inside. In fact, the cups seem to be small bowls with a handle attached. I am quite uncertain whether the handled jugs and cups are native Mohave forms or derived in imitation of Caucasian shapes. It is unclear what specific function their handles would have served in Mohave life, in sand-floored houses empty of furniture or apparatus. Yet probably g and certainly h have been used. And the ware of the jugs and cups, as well as their painted designs, are typical Mohave. They look like an 'acculturation acceptance'--a new trait adopted into the old native pattern. The problem will probably be solved when enough datable precontact and protocontact ware from the Mohave and kindred Yuman tribes becomes available. With these round vessels the forking-and-angled design of the bowl interiors recurs: in the jar a, the jug f, on the interior of cup i. It will be seen that these come with and without dot stippling. The pattern of jug d was called tattoo points; but it is the same as the coyote teeth of plate,l,q. Similarly, e, though called hotahpave halter, resembles plate,g-i; and g, called fish backbone, lines up with the fish backbone designs on spoons: plate,e,f,k,o,s.:,,, a, bowl, 293; diameter 5/81 mm., height 6 mm. Design: inside, raccoon hand; outside, fish bone, atci isaka. This is from Tokwaa's wife. b, broken bowl, 282; d. 5/87, h. 5/8. Design; raccoon hand. c. large bowl or platter, 745/8, of type called suyire, d. 30, h. 25/8. Weight, 4 oz. The flanges to hold mesquite bark binding in place are unusually prominent. This is the largest and second heaviest round vessel in the collection; but it is low, 8 per cent of the diameter--at the minimum for bowls, maximum for platters. It is not strictly a bowl, because there is no neck constriction: the vessel curves in unbroken convexity up to the rim. On the other hand it is not a typical platter because it has flanges and is bound like a bowl. There are 1 of these flanges, 5/8 to 5/8 mm. long, projecting to mm., and spaced quite irregularly, with 20, 5/8, 0, 5/8, 5/8, 5/8, 15/8, 5/8, 5/8, 20, 5/8 mm. between their centers. Atci is fish, isaka is bone, but the form mostly obtained tat, backbone. The bowls a and b are grouped together because of their raccoon-hand designs; compare also plate,p. Bowl a looks unused and may have been made for sale; b has been used and is probably from the same house, though almost certainly not painted by the same person. The large platter-bowl c has its painted design built up around four big rhomboids or hexagons, nearly rounded into pointed ovoids with triple solid tips; between which similarly pointed triangles project toward the center from the rim. The oval platters d and e, nos. 738, 294, are the convex backs or under sides of plate,i,j. The former looks used, the latter new and perhaps for sale. The tortoises on the tortoise carapace on the of the same piece seem an exaggeration from normal Mohave style. In my field catalogue I entered d as 'dish-like spoon'; and e, two years later, simply as 'oval spoon,' which is confirmed by the notation: kam'ota kapeta, viz., 'tortoise spoon.' The two katela or parchers, f and g, having adjacent numbers, 3787 and 3788, are probably out of one household--a conservative one, inasmuch as they were secured in 908. They differ slightly in proportions, yet are closely similar. Piece f, the longer and flatter, has its ends brought into a semblance of the abbreviated quail beaks and eyes found on some spoons--class A2. The rims of both f and g are transversely flat and wiped or pinched over inward to extra thickness, then scored regularly with a fingernail or stick; in g the outer edge has also been lightly punch-marked. In 904, I saw in a native house upriver from Fort Mohave a bi-pointed parcher or katela which had nose and eyes at the ends like those on quail spoons; and another which had along the edge a line of overlapping impressions that might have been made by the square corner of a board or tool. This description suggests,f and,g, which I secured four years later at Needles. The canteen in its net, h, no. 3793, has evidently seen use. This was the kind taken on journeys.

The Mohave people, who reside along the lower Colorado River in present-day Arizona, have a long history of creating exquisite pottery that reflects their deep connection to their land, traditions, and spiritual beliefs. Mohave pottery is not merely functional but also serves as a form of artistic expression and a means of preserving cultural heritage. Through intricate designs and skilled craftsmanship, Mohave pottery embodies the essence of Mohave identity and aesthetics.  One of the distinguishing features of Mohave pottery is its unique vessel design. Mohave potters employ various techniques and styles to create vessels that are both utilitarian and visually striking. Traditional Mohave pottery is typically made using coiling methods, where long strips of clay are rolled out and then coiled on top of each other to form the shape of the vessel. Once the basic form is created, the potter refines the shape by hand-smoothing the surface and shaping the rim and base. The vessels are then left to dry before being fired in an open outdoor pit kiln, using mesquite wood or cow dung as fuel.  The designs found on Mohave pottery are as diverse as they are captivating. Mohave potters draw inspiration from their natural surroundings, incorporating elements such as animals, plants, and geometric patterns into their designs. Animal motifs like birds, lizards, and turtles are commonly depicted, symbolizing aspects of nature that hold cultural significance for the Mohave people. Similarly, plant designs such as cactus flowers and mesquite pods reflect the flora of the desert landscape that sustains the Mohave community.  Geometric patterns play a crucial role in Mohave pottery design, with intricate spirals, triangles, and zigzag lines adorning many vessels. These geometric motifs are often symbolic representations of the interconnectedness of all living beings and the cyclical nature of life. The skillful application of these patterns not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of Mohave pottery but also conveys deeper layers of meaning that resonate with Mohave spirituality and worldview.  The process of creating Mohave pottery is a labor-intensive and intricate art form that requires patience, skill, and a deep understanding of the materials used. Mohave potters gather clay from local sources, which they then process by hand to remove impurities and create a workable consistency. The addition of temper, such as sand or crushed pottery shards, helps strengthen the clay and prevent the vessel from cracking during the drying and firing stages. The use of natural materials and traditional techniques ensures that each piece of Mohave pottery is a testament to the cultural heritage and expertise of the Mohave people.  In addition to their technical proficiency, Mohave potters infuse their creations with symbolism and meaning that transcend mere aesthetics. Each vessel carries with it a story, a connection to the past, and a reflection of the values and beliefs of the Mohave people. The act of creating pottery is not just a craft but a form of cultural expression that reinforces the bonds between the Mohave community and their ancestors.  The significance of Mohave pottery extends beyond its artistic value; it serves as a link to the past and a bridge to future generations. Through the preservation and practice of traditional pottery-making techniques, Mohave artisans keep alive a heritage that is deeply rooted in the land and the collective memory of their people. By passing down their knowledge and skills to younger generations, Mohave potters ensure that this enduring art form continues to thrive and evolve in the modern world.  In conclusion, Mohave pottery stands as a testament to the beauty, ingenuity, and cultural vitality of the Mohave people. The intricate vessel designs, rich symbolism, and masterful craftsmanship embedded in each piece of Mohave pottery showcase the depth of Mohave artistry and the resilience of Mohave culture. As one admires the elegance and complexity of Mohave pottery, one cannot help but be drawn into a world where tradition and innovation intertwine, creating objects of timeless beauty and profound cultural significance.""","811"
"Heath Sidney 1872 ","""A few years later the monastery was plundered by the Danes, when the monks beat a hasty retreat, but returned in 68 on the entreaty of King Edgar. A mint was shortly established here, wherein the first coins were struck naming Athelstan 'King of England'. The Danes made continuous raids in the neighbourhood, but were decisively defeated by the West Countrymen in 001, at Pinhoe, a few miles from Exeter. From that time until the treacherous massacre of the Danes in Wessex upon St. Brice's Day in 002 by Ethelred, this part of the country was comparatively free from their inroads; but Gunhilda, the sister of Swegen, King of Denmark, being among the slain, this king came to avenge her death. He sailed up the Exe, burning and plundering the villages on its banks, and for four years his army marched in every direction across Wessex, and was at length induced to withdraw on being paid a was first levied on Exeter. After the Battle of Hastings, Gytha, the mother of Harold, took refuge in Exeter, and Leofric, the bishop, offered to render homage to William as Royal suzerain; but the Conqueror would have no half-hearted submission, so Exeter closed its gates to the Normans. It held out for eighteen days, when the military science of the Normans, and particularly the skill they showed in undermining the walls, caused it to surrender. The resistance won the besiegers' respect and brought unusually good terms from so ruthless a victor as William. The lives of the garrison were spared, Gytha was allowed to seek safety by sea, and it has been said that the victorious troops were withdrawn from the city gates to prevent them from claiming the licentious privileges so generally granted to their followers by the Norman kings. As is fitting for its county town, the first entry in the Devonshire Domesday deals with Exeter, in which city, it is recorded, the king had 85/8 houses rendering customary dues. The generally debased character of the coinage of the time led to various expedients being adopted by the Exchequer for securing approximately accurate payment of a specified sum of money. Among other things the entries in Domesday state that in the total-- ' 8 pounds per annum. Of these Baldwin the Sheriff has six pounds by weight and assay, and Colvin has of them 2 pounds by tale for the service of Queen Eadgyth'. This entry is significant, for one pound or twenty shillings meant one pound or twelve ounces troy of silver; and when money was payable by weight twenty shillings were not taken as the equivalent of one pound unless they fully weighed one pound. In this instance it is observable that the portion of the customary dues rendered for the 85/8 houses, which went to the Exchequer, was collected by the sheriff under the strictest rules of weight and assay, whereas the portion allotted to the widow of Edward the Confessor was received by the tale only. The authorities took care that the sheriff collected the full amount due to the Crown, but did not trouble themselves about the ex-queen's share. It has been affirmed that it was by the Normans that the fairs of England were moulded into the shape with which we are most familiar. At Exeter, in 276, in reply to a writ of quo warranto, it was satisfactorily shown that the rights of the city, its fee-farm rent and its farms, dated from pre-Conquest days. The privileges and emoluments attached to fairs in large towns were very great. During the time allotted to them the citizens were often debarred from selling anything, whereas strangers could vend their wares during the fair, but at no other period of the year. In Cossin's Reminiscences of are told how 'at Exeter, on the occasion of the Lammas Fair, a procession yet perambulates the city, one man bearing a pole with a gigantic stuffed glove at the top of it, the latter being subsequently hung out at the Guildhall'. Many of England's reigning sovereigns have visited the city, among them being Edward IV and Richard III. Henry VII came thither on October, 497, on the suppression of Perkin Warbeck's rebellion, when that rebel had attempted to capture the city. The rebels were brought before the king, bareheaded and with halters round their necks, and after they had pleaded for mercy Henry pardoned them. On his departure, the king presented the civic authorities with a sword and cap of maintenance, both of which are still carried before the Mayor and Corporation on occasions of state. The citizens of Exeter have always been noted for their stanch loyalty to the reigning house, with the consequence that many rights and privileges have been granted to it. The city motto, Semper Fidelis, was conferred by Queen Elizabeth in recognition of the contributions, both of men and money, made to the fleet that vanquished the Spanish Armada. That the motto was merited is evident when we recall the fact that, with the exception of Frobisher and Cavendish, practically the whole of the leading seamen who chased the Spanish ships along the Channel were born in the land of the Tamar, the Tavy, and the Dart. During the early part of the Civil War the citizens were divided in their sympathies, some supporting the Parliament and others the King; but the city soon fell into the hands of the former. In 643, however, Sir Ralph Hopton, the famous Royalist general, marched on Exeter with a force made all the more formidable for siege purposes by the cannon he had previously captured at Halton. The immediate capture of the city by the Royalist forces was expected, the Mercurius Aulius of June, 643, remarking that: 'if the old observation be of any credit, that cats and mice doe commonly forsake a ruinous and decaying house, that not like to continue long in the Rebels' hands'. The proud and rebellious city was assaulted and captured by the Royalist forces under Prince Maurice on September, 643, after a siege lasting sixteen days, and a full account of its fall appeared in the issue of the Mercurius Aulius of September. In May, 644, Queen Henrietta Maria took up her abode in the city, at Bedford House, where, on 6 June of the same year, the Princess Henrietta was born. In the following month Charles I came to see his little daughter, and again in September, when he appointed Thomas Fuller, Vicar of Broadwindsor, in Dorset, as chaplain to the princess. The queen, who had retired to Exeter as a safe place for her confinement, soon afterwards had to leave there suddenly on the approach of a Parliamentary army in command of the Earl of Essex. Her Majesty's easiest way to France was by sea, and to prevent this Cromwell had sent a fleet to Torbay to intercept her, should she attempt to leave England by that route. Finding this road closed, she made for Falmouth, from which port she got safely away. During the siege by Fairfax the inhabitants of the city suffered considerably, owing to the food supplies being intercepted. One day a flight of larks came into the town, 'which were', says Fuller, 'as welcome as quails in the wilderness'. The birds were so numerous that, notwithstanding the prevailing famine, they were sold for twopence a dozen. 'Of this miraculous event', wrote Fuller, 'I was not only an eye but a mouth witness.' The city capitulated on 3 April, 646, among the conditions of surrender being that the Cathedral should be spared, and the garrison accorded the honours of war. After the landing of William of Orange at Brixham, in 688, he marched through the county to Exeter and entered the city by its western gate. He proceeded direct to the Cathedral and took his seat in the bishop's throne with his chaplain Burnet near him. A few of the prebendaries and choristers attended the service, but when Burnet began to read the Prince's Declaration, after the singing of the Te Deum, they hurriedly departed. The bishop, Thomas Lamplugh, had proceeded to James on hearing that the Dutch had landed, and was rewarded with the Archbishopric of York. He afterwards assisted at William III's coronation. The Dean of Exeter had also left the city, and the Deanery was prepared for the Prince's reception. George III was the last English sovereign to stay in Exeter, and he also resided at the Deanery. Although the Cathedral is the main attraction modern Exeter has to offer to the tourist, a walk through the historic old city will reveal the fact that, in addition to some highly interesting old churches, it possesses a not inconsiderable number of ancient buildings. At the same time there has been an appalling amount of destruction, some of it apparently of an unnecessary kind, as the recent dismantling of the beautiful old courtyard in the rear of Bampfylde House, the city residence of the Poltimore family. The visitor who arrives at Exeter either by the Great Western or the South-Western Railway, the station of the latter being the more central of the two, can soon reach the busy and picturesque High Street by way of Queen Street, one of the broadest thoroughfares in the city. The most interesting building in High Street, and one that, in this respect, ranks next to the Cathedral, is the Guildhall, with a portico projecting over the pavement. It is probably one of the oldest municipal buildings in the country, for in 330 we find that the Guildhall was in a ruinous condition, and it was then rebuilt. Again, in 464, it was built up anew in a more commodious and efficient manner, while the building as we see it to-day, with its facade, is the result of still further alterations in 5/892. The entrance porch is separated from the inner hall by a massive oak doorway, and the hall itself, 0 feet long and 5/8 feet wide, is panelled throughout in oak, with a frieze consisting of shields charged with the arms of former mayors, aldermen, recorders, and of the city companies.""","""History of Exeter""","2163","""Exeter, a charming city in the southwest of England, boasts a rich and fascinating history that dates back over two thousand years. Situated on the River Exe, Exeter has been a strategic settlement since Roman times, playing a significant role in the development of the region and the country as a whole. From its Roman origins to its medieval heyday and beyond, Exeter's history is a tapestry of conquest, trade, industry, and culture that has shaped the city into what it is today.  The story of Exeter begins with the Romans, who established the settlement of Isca Dumnoniorum around 55 AD. The Romans recognized the strategic importance of the area due to its location on a hill overlooking the River Exe, making it a natural defensive position. They built a fortress and a walled town, which served as a key military and administrative center in the southwest of Britannia. The Roman presence in Exeter is still evident today, with remains such as the city walls, the Roman baths, and the underground passages known as the Exeter's Underground Passages, providing a glimpse into this early period of Exeter's history.  After the Romans left Britain in the early 5th century, Exeter became part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. The city continued to thrive as a trading hub, with its proximity to the sea allowing for easy access to continental Europe. The arrival of Christianity in the 7th century brought the building of St. Mary's Church, one of the oldest churches in England that still stands today. The Vikings also left their mark on Exeter when they sacked the city in 876, but it was quickly rebuilt, showing the resilience of its inhabitants.  The medieval period marked a golden age for Exeter, with the city becoming one of the wealthiest and most important in England. Exeter Cathedral, a masterpiece of Gothic architecture, was founded in the 12th century and became the heart of the city. The cathedral's imposing towers dominate the skyline to this day and stand as a testament to the city's religious and cultural significance. The guildhalls, almshouses, and medieval houses that line the streets of the city center further showcase Exeter's prosperous past.  In the 14th century, Exeter faced hardship during the Black Death, which decimated the population and caused economic turmoil. However, the city recovered and continued to grow, becoming a center for the wool trade in the southwest. The Tudor period saw Exeter play a role in the religious changes of the time, with the cathedral being used as a rallying point for Catholics during the reign of Queen Mary I. The city also welcomed Queen Elizabeth I during her progress through the country, further highlighting its importance on the national stage.  The 17th century brought about a turbulent period for Exeter during the English Civil War. The city declared its support for Parliament, leading to a siege by Royalist forces in 1643. Despite the hardships faced during the conflict, Exeter emerged relatively unscathed compared to other cities in the country. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 saw Exeter regain its stability and prosperity, with industries such as cloth, leather, and pottery thriving.  The Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries brought further changes to Exeter, with the city expanding rapidly as new industries emerged. The arrival of the railway in the mid-19th century connected Exeter to London and other major cities, transforming the city into a key transportation hub in the region. The Victorian era saw the construction of elegant buildings, such as the Royal Albert Memorial Museum and the Royal Clarence Hotel, which added to the city's architectural charm.  The 20th century saw Exeter endure the challenges of two world wars, with the city suffering heavy bombing during the Blitz in World War II. Despite the destruction, Exeter once again showed its resilience by rebuilding and revitalizing the city center in the post-war years. The latter half of the 20th century marked a period of development and modernization for Exeter, with the creation of new residential areas, shopping centers, and cultural venues.  Today, Exeter continues to thrive as a vibrant and dynamic city that honors its heritage while embracing the future. The city's historic core has been preserved, with its medieval buildings and cobbled streets blending seamlessly with modern amenities and attractions. Exeter Cathedral remains a symbol of the city's enduring legacy, while the Quayside area has been transformed into a bustling waterfront with shops, restaurants, and leisure facilities.  Exeter's rich history is celebrated throughout the city, with events, museums, and tours offering insights into its past. The Royal Albert Memorial Museum showcases Exeter's heritage through its extensive collections, while guided walks around the city reveal hidden gems and stories of times gone by. The annual Exeter Festival of South West Food and Drink pays homage to the region's culinary history, highlighting the importance of local produce and traditional recipes.  In conclusion, the history of Exeter is a tale of resilience, adaptation, and cultural richness that has shaped the city into the vibrant metropolis it is today. From its Roman beginnings to its medieval glory and beyond, Exeter's heritage is woven into the very fabric of the city, inviting visitors and residents alike to explore its past and appreciate its enduring charm. As Exeter continues to evolve and grow, its history remains a source of inspiration and pride, ensuring that the city's legacy will endure for generations to come.""","1110"
"Wilson John Inspector of Naval Hospitals ","""Five fresh nurses were brought into Haslar Hospital to attend the choleral patients. They passed at least half their time, night and day, in the ward, and slept there in their turn. They were much employed in rubbing the patients, and consequently leaning over them, administering injections, removing ejections, &c., in short performing all the duties of their place, which were at once trying, laborious, and likely to excite apprehension, yet none of them was affected. These, and such facts, of which a multitude might be accumulated, may be objected to, on the ground that they afford negative evidence only, and that one positive proof of contagion would outweigh them all. Be it so. But where is the positive proof to be obtained, and by what distinguishing mark is it to be recognised? Suppose one of the five new nurses brought into Haslar to attend on the subjects of cholera had been attacked by the disease, during, or soon after that service, must it be admitted that the disease was communicated by the patient to his nurse? It is submitted that it should not. Before such admission can be held necessary, it must be shown that the disease which attacked the nurse was not derived from places outside the Hospital, which he was allowed to visit, or from the cause diffused in the air of the neighbourhood, in less or greater concentration, and manifesting its powers relatively to the degree of concentration, and the force of pre-disposing co-operating agents. It would be unsafe to assert that cholera can never, under any circumstances become contagious; but if the conditions which lead to its acquiring that property, the crisis by which it is effected, and the period of its accomplishment cannot be ascertained, the policy of searching for it may be questioned. Truth is desirable on its own account certainly, but the truth or falsehood of a position is relatively important according to its bearing on the business of life; and if the position that cholera may become contagious could be demonstrated, to what practical purpose could it be turned? It does not appear how it could be used to stay the progress or mitigate the power of the disease. It would not likely be proposed as a reason for separating the sick from the healthy, or enforcing quarantine regulations of any kind. He must be a very ardent believer in the self-propagating power of cholera who would urge authority to shut up, and surround with guards, houses standing in many different parts of Gosport, Portsea, Portsmouth, and Southsea, and half the towns and villages of England. There is little danger of such measures being adopted now, although they were seriously put forth by the General Board of Health, under sanction of an order in Council, in October, 831; but, if they were put in force, it would not be rash to assert that they would aggravate the evil immensely. They would turn fear into terror, and interfere with, or prevent the ordinary offices of humanity; thus, at the same time, supplying one of the most powerful predisposing causes of the disease, and fearfully augmenting the misery and danger of the affected. In such a state of things it would be impossible to persuade persons of character, like those who, without hesitation, undertook the duty of nursing the choleral patients in Haslar, to enter on similar service for eighteen-pence a day; nay, it might be impossible to persuade men to enter on such a forlorn hope by any consideration. Although the pro-contagionist might not be moved by facts and inferences like these, he would perhaps be disposed to ask the man propounding them, some such question as the following. As you do not admit that contagion is the cause of cholera, what in your opinion is the cause? In return it would not be impertinent to say to the querist, what is the cause of ague? Something emanating from the surface of the earth, on the spot, or not far from the place where its subjects are resident? something so subtle as to be imperceptible by the senses, and hitherto beyond the scrutiny of chemists and meteorologists. He would, it is presumed, answer in some such terms, or if he attempted any much more precise and instructive, he would proceed without the warrant of fact and experience. Such at least would be the general reply of the profession, and a more complete and unconditional confession of ignorance of every thing respecting the essence of a most powerful and wide spread cause of disease cannot be made. Though we know a good deal of the places most prolific in its production, as well as of the agents which co-operatively increase its force, we know it solely by its effects. In very similar, if not precisely the same terms, it seems to the writer, should the question, what is the cause of cholera, be answered. Little, if anything more can be affirmed respecting its origin, but almost every thing authentic in its history, progress, and phenomena, testify to its having a local source, and generally very limited scope of operation. Thus it appears simultaneously in different, distant places, leaving intermediate places untouched. It attacks in one town a particular district, street, or portion of street, beyond which it does not travel. In another town it shows itself among distant portions of the inhabitants, leaving long spaces unscathed. Again, while one town suffers severely from it, another in the neighbourhood has not a single case then, or thereafter; or the town which escapes this season, falls fatally under its sway the next, when all the rest of the country is clear. These and such circumstances as these, point as clearly as it is possible to point at the endemic source of cholera, although the essential cause of the disease cannot be ascertained. But although we cannot in cholera, more than in periodic fever, ascertain the essential cause, there is no difficulty in showing the accidental auxiliary agents, which both in disposing to, and co-operating with it, give it much of its prevalence, and most of its fatal power. They consist in whatever deranges healthy action, and impairs constitutional vigour such as unwholesome insufficient or irregular supplies of food over labour crowded and defective ventilation dissolute habits, including vicious indulgences in intoxicating drink, and want of personal and domestic cleanliness apprehension, anxiety, and inordinate emotions of the mind; and defective drainage, including sewerage, with resulting accumulation of organic matters. For the last, at least, the State and the authorities acting under it ought to be held responsible. Whether the last named agent defective drainage and its consequences constitutes any thing positive to the essential cause of the disease, or is necessarily connected with it, or whether it only co-operates with those specified before it, in lowering the standard of health, by the production in excess of hydrogen and other gases, injurious to life, and thereby predisposes the body, through augmented susceptibility, for the action of the essential cause cannot be determined. It is pretty certain, however, that neither it in any quantity, nor any amount of the other agents classed with it, as disposing and co-operating powers, in the production and extension of cholera, can of themselves create it. If they could, not only part of Ireland, but of places nearer home, must have been decimated, some of them depopulated. Whether excess or deficiency in the electric element, or disturbance in its ordinary relations, in the place where cholera appears, acts any part in the production of the disease, is not known. It seems probable that there is something abnormal in its distribution and movements; but that is all that can ever be reasonably conjectured, at least for the present, respecting it. Whether there is any affinity between the essential cause of cholera and periodic fever, and, if any, of what kind, are questions that naturally suggest themselves in investigating the etiology of the former. That the question, as far as it relates to a certain affinity in the two cases, should be answered affirmatively, the following considerations seem to shew. Swampy undrained soils, the banks of rivers, the margins of harbours, and other low lying localities, with places where organic remains are artificially accumulated, or allowed to accumulate, prove the most prolific positions in the production of cholera, as well as of periodic fever. Both before the outbreak of cholera, and on its subsidence, fever of type, more or less distinctly marked, with predominance of gastric symptoms, are more frequent than usual. Some remarks, as already stated, were made on this subject in the Medical Notes on China; it may be added that many circumstances might be cited, tending to show that there is a close connection, not only between the causes of cholera and periodic fever, but also between it and endemic fever generally. All this is very vague and unsatisfactory, but with such generalities, negatives and probabilities, it is feared we must for the present at least, be as content as we can, unless we are disposed to leap to conclusions, without finding the steps of evidence by which alone they can be safely reached; or are willing to subscribe the creed, that cholera, however first produced, is reproduced only through the instrumentality of the human body that, by whatever acts, combination of acts, or of accidents it began, it is continued solely by contagion. The essential cause of cholera the causa sine qua non est as well as of other things in nature with what are more familiar, is, and perhaps ever will be, beyond the reach of human penetration; and were its nature and properties ascertained, such knowledge might contribute little or nothing to our means of resisting its effects.""","""Cholera transmission and nursing experiences""","1984","""Cholera is a bacterial infection caused by the Vibrio cholerae bacterium. It primarily affects the intestines, leading to severe watery diarrhea and dehydration. The disease is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Understanding how cholera spreads is vital in preventing outbreaks and providing appropriate nursing care.  Cholera transmission occurs predominantly through the consumption of water or food contaminated with fecal matter containing the cholera bacterium. Poor sanitation and inadequate access to clean water are significant factors in the spread of cholera. In areas with overcrowding, improper waste disposal, and limited hygiene practices, the risk of transmission increases substantially.  Contaminated water sources, such as rivers, ponds, or wells, can serve as reservoirs for the Vibrio cholerae bacterium. When individuals consume untreated water or eat raw or undercooked seafood from contaminated waters, they are at risk of contracting cholera. Additionally, food prepared in unhygienic conditions or washed with contaminated water can also lead to the spread of the disease.  Once ingested, the cholera bacterium multiplies in the small intestine, producing a potent toxin that causes the excessive release of fluids, resulting in profuse watery diarrhea. This rapid and severe fluid loss can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and, if left untreated, can be fatal within hours.  Preventing cholera transmission requires a multi-faceted approach. Improving sanitation infrastructure, providing access to clean water, promoting good hygiene practices, and conducting community education about cholera prevention are essential strategies. Water purification methods, such as boiling, chlorination, or filtration, can help eliminate the cholera bacterium from water sources.  Nurses play a crucial role in both preventing cholera outbreaks and managing cases effectively. In communities at risk of cholera, nurses educate individuals about proper handwashing, safe food handling practices, and the importance of using clean water for drinking and cooking. By empowering communities with knowledge, nurses contribute significantly to disease prevention.  During cholera outbreaks, nurses are at the frontline of patient care, providing essential treatment to those affected. Rehydration therapy is the cornerstone of cholera treatment, aiming to replace lost fluids and electrolytes rapidly. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) or intravenous fluids may be administered based on the severity of dehydration.  In severe cases, where dehydration is profound, prompt intervention is critical to prevent complications such as shock and organ failure. Nurses closely monitor patients' fluid status, vital signs, and electrolyte levels to guide treatment decisions and ensure optimal outcomes. Close supervision and meticulous care are paramount in managing cholera cases effectively.  Moreover, nurses play a pivotal role in infection control measures during cholera outbreaks. Adhering to strict protocols for hand hygiene, wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, and implementing isolation precautions help prevent the spread of the disease within healthcare settings. By maintaining a clean and hygienic environment, nurses contribute to containing the outbreak and protecting vulnerable individuals.  In conclusion, understanding the transmission of cholera is fundamental in combating this infectious disease. By addressing the root causes of transmission, promoting preventive measures, and delivering quality nursing care, we can mitigate the impact of cholera outbreaks and save lives. Nurses, with their expertise, compassion, and dedication, play a critical role in the comprehensive management of cholera cases and in fostering community resilience against this preventable disease.""","676"
"Hillis Newell Dwight","""Cervantes writes the only world-wide thing in Spanish literature, and for an abiding place Spain rewards him, not with a mansion, but with a blanket in a dungeon, feeds him, not upon the apples of Paradise, but on the apples of Sodom, and gives him to drink, not the nectar of the gods, but vinegar mingled with gall. Next to the Bible in influence upon English literature comes the Pilgrim's Progress. England kept John Bunyan in jail at Bedford for twelve years, as his reward. For some reason, nations reserve their wreaths of recognition until the heart is broken, until hope is dead, and the ambitions are in heaven. The history of the other great leaders, therefore, leads us to expect that the greatest, because the most typical, Englishman of all time, shall be unique in his obloquy and shame, as he was signal in his supreme gifts. During his life the very skies rained lies and cruel taunts; in his death the mildewed lips of slander took up new falsehoods. In the grave the very dust of this hero furnished a sure foundation for the temple of liberty, but his grave was despoiled. With pomp and pageantry Charles the Second ordered his bones to be exhumed, and the skeleton hung between thieves at Tyburn to satisfy his hatred. For twelve years Cromwell's skull was elevated upon a pole above Westminster Hall, where it stood exposed to the rains of twelve summers and the snows of twelve winters. And now that two hundred and fifty years have passed away, these centuries have not availed for extinguishing the fires of hatred and controversy, or for doing justice to the memory of this man, Oliver Cromwell, God's appointed king. We would naturally expect that time would have availed to clear the name and fame of Cromwell and to secure for him the recognition that his achievements deserve. But it was hard for some royalists to forgive this man who turned his hand against the sacred person of the King. For nearly three centuries the conflict has raged. The royal historians count Cromwell the greatest hypocrite in history, the trickster, the regicide, the political Judas of all time. For a hundred years after his death, no man was found brave enough to mention the name of Oliver Cromwell in Windsor Castle or the House of Lords. England's Abbey has made a place for the statues of that one-talent general, Burgoyne, whose chief business was to surrender his troops to our colonial soldiers, but the Abbey has no niche for a bust of the only English general who ranks with the great soldiers of history--Alexander, Csar, Napoleon, Grant, and now Foch--these six and no more. The British Houses of Parliament are crowded with statues of politicians who gave the people what they wanted, and some statesmen who gave the people what they ought to have. And there, too, are found the busts of kings and queens, Bloody Mary, contemptible John, those little feeblings and parasites named the Georges. But low down and bespattered with mud she has written the name of her greatest monarch, and the most powerful ruler that ever sat upon a throne. Not until Carlyle came forward did the cloud of slander begin to lift. When the three hundredth anniversary of the birth of Cromwell was celebrated, Great Britain awakened to the fact that too little recognition had been given to the great reformer whose career was one of the marvels of English history. The measure of a nation's greatness is the kind of man it admires. To-day, it is of little consequence what we think of Cromwell, but it is of the first importance that Cromwell should approve the leaders of our world-capitals. Only in the last generation has the tide turned, and the reaction begun to set in. John Morley, busied with his biography of Gladstone, took time to write a history of the man whom he calls the maker of English history. Professor Gardiner asserts that England has done injustice to Cromwell and that the time has come for her to right a great wrong. All the world has at last begun to recognise the fact that the farmer of Huntingdon was an uncrowned king, ruling of his own natural right. The world's ingratitude to Cromwell becomes the more striking when we remember what he did for Great Britain, for her people, to right the wrongs of her poor, to found her free institutions and to give her a place among the nations of the earth. Oliver Cromwell found England almost next to nothing in the scale of European politics. France pitied poor little England, and Spain, the one world-wide force of the time, despised her. He found her people a group of quarrelling sects, divided, hostile and full of hate. Her soil was scored with countless insurrections; her commerce was dead; her navy was so miserably weak that pirates sailed up the Thames, dropped anchor in the night in front of Westminster Hall, and flung defiance to the frightened merchants. In a single year, three thousand Englishmen were impressed by these pirates and sold in the slave markets of Algiers, Constantinople and the West Indies. He found the king a tyrant, who one day made the boast that he had brought every man who had opposed his will to the Tower or the scaffold. He found Parliament saying, 'We have struggled for twenty years, and every attempt has ended with a halter, and it is better to endure a present ill than flee to others that we know not of.' And in the very darkest hour of England's history, this farmer flung himself into the breach and besought his countrymen to unite in one supreme effort to achieve liberty for the common people. For forty years he had been a plain country gentleman, content with his farm; ten years later he was 'the most famous military captain in Europe, the greatest man in England, and the wisest ruler England ever had.' He lived to hold the destinies of his country in his hands, to enthrone justice and toleration over a great part of Europe, received overtures for alliances from many kings, and died in the royal palace at Whitehall, and was buried amid the lamentations of many who had been his bitter enemies. Cromwell's greatness stirs our sense of wonder the more, because he accomplished what others had sought to achieve and failed. Balfour or Lloyd George trained for years to his task, is like one who stands in the midst of an arsenal, protected by walls and battlements, and served by cannon and machine guns. To employ Carlyle's expressive figure, a dwarf who stands with a match before a cannon can beat down a stronghold, but he must be a giant indeed who can capture an armed fortress with naked fists, as did Oliver Cromwell. He lived in an age of great men. The era of Shakespeare, of Marlowe, Jonson and Bacon was closing. It was the era of John Pym, called 'The Old Man Eloquent.' It was the era of Hampden, the patrician, the orator and hero. It was the time of Sir Harry Vane, the distinguished gentleman who came to Boston to be made ruler of that new city, and whom Wendell Phillips called the noblest patriot that ever walked the streets of the new capital. Coke was on the bench, meditating his decisions, while Lyttleton was perfecting his interpretations of the Constitution. John Milton was making his plea for the liberty of the press. Owen and Sherlock and Howe were in the pulpits. These were among the bravest spirits that have ever stood upon our earth. All hated tyranny, and all loved liberty. All sought to overthrow the rule of the despot and yet, when all had done their best, England was sold like a slave in the market-place. It was the farmer of Huntingdon who, in that critical hour, came forward and showed himself equal to the emergency. It was this country gentleman, without political experience, this general who became a statesman without the discipline of statecraft, who became the shepherd of his people and overthrew that citadel of iniquity called the Divine Right of Kings; who rid England of her pirates, developed a great commerce, built up the most powerful navy that then sailed the sea--a possession England has never lost--corrected the code, rectified the Constitution, laid the foundation for the present Bill of Rights. This is why John Morley asks us to study carefully the lineaments of this man whose body England, to her undying shame, and in the days of her dishonour, hung in chains at Tyburn. If we are to understand Cromwell's character and career and his place among the world's leaders, we must recall his age and time and the England of that far-off day, when he wrought his work and dipped his sword in heaven. What of the religious condition of England in the era of intolerance, when the prophet of God was anointed with the ointment of war, black and sulphurous? It is the year 630, and Cromwell is still in his early manhood. One bright morning, with St. Paul's to his back, Cromwell entered Ludgate Circus. In the midst of the circus stood a scaffold and around it was a great throng, crowding and pressing toward the place of torture. At the foot of the scaffold was a venerable scholar, his white hair flowing upon his shoulders, a man of stainless character and spotless life, renowned for his devotion, eloquence and patriotism. When the executioner led the aged pastor up the steps, the soldiers tore off his garments. He was whipped until blood ran in streams down his back, both nostrils were slit and his ears cropped off, hot irons were brought and two letters, 'S-S'--sower of sedition--were burned into his forehead. What crime had this pastor committed? Perhaps he had lifted a firebrand upon the King's palace; perhaps he had organized some foul gunpowder plot to overthrow the throne itself. Perhaps he had been guilty of treason, or some foul and nameless sin against the State. Not so. The reading of the decision of the judge and the decree of the punishment made clear the truth.""","""Recognition of Oliver Cromwell's Legacy""","2109","""Oliver Cromwell, a controversial figure in English history, left a lasting impact that continues to be debated and scrutinized to this day. His legacy is one of complexity, with interpretations varying widely depending on one's perspective. From military successes to political upheaval, Cromwell's influence on England and beyond cannot be understated. This essay delves into the recognition of Oliver Cromwell's legacy, exploring the different aspects of his life and the lasting imprint he left on the historical landscape.  Cromwell's rise to prominence began during the turbulent era of the English Civil War, a period marked by intense conflict between Parliamentarians and Royalists. As a skilled military leader, Cromwell played a pivotal role in the Parliamentarian forces, ultimately leading them to victory over King Charles I and establishing the Commonwealth. His military prowess and strategic acumen are widely recognized, with many historians acknowledging his contributions to the success of the Parliamentary cause.  Beyond his military achievements, Cromwell's political legacy is equally significant. As Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, Cromwell wielded considerable power and implemented a series of reforms aimed at strengthening the government and promoting Puritan values. His tenure as head of state was marked by efforts to stabilize the country after years of conflict, with initiatives such as religious tolerance and administrative reforms earning him both praise and criticism.  One of the most controversial aspects of Cromwell's legacy is his role in the execution of King Charles I. In 1649, Charles I was tried and convicted of high treason by a special court established by Parliament, with Cromwell playing a key role in the proceedings. The king's execution sent shockwaves throughout Europe and divided public opinion in England. While some viewed Cromwell as a champion of justice and a defender of parliamentary sovereignty, others condemned him as a regicide and traitor to the crown.  Cromwell's religious beliefs also influenced his legacy, as he was a devout Puritan who sought to establish a godly society based on strict moral principles. His commitment to religious reform led to the suppression of the Anglican Church and the promotion of Puritan values throughout the Commonwealth. While Cromwell's religious zeal endeared him to some, it alienated others who did not share his vision of a Puritan commonwealth.  In considering Cromwell's legacy, it is essential to examine the impact of his policies on different segments of society. While some groups benefited from his reforms, others suffered under his rule. For example, Catholics and Royalists faced persecution and discrimination during Cromwell's time as Lord Protector, leading to deep-seated resentment and animosity towards his regime. Similarly, Irish Catholics remember Cromwell for his brutal military campaigns in Ireland, which resulted in widespread suffering and loss of life.  Despite his controversial reputation, Cromwell's legacy has been the subject of ongoing reassessment and reinterpretation. In recent years, there has been a greater recognition of his contributions to the development of parliamentary democracy and the rule of law in England. Historians have highlighted Cromwell's role in challenging monarchical authority and laying the groundwork for constitutional government, with some arguing that his actions paved the way for the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the establishment of modern constitutional monarchy.  In addition to his political and military achievements, Cromwell's legacy is also evident in the cultural and intellectual spheres. His impact on literature, art, and theology is profound, with writers and thinkers drawing inspiration from his life and times. Cromwell's speeches and letters offer valuable insights into his character and beliefs, providing a window into the mind of one of history's most enigmatic figures.  The recognition of Oliver Cromwell's legacy is a nuanced and contentious issue, with divergent views on his significance and impact on English history. While some celebrate him as a champion of liberty and a proto-democratic leader, others condemn him as a tyrant and a dictator who trampled on individual rights and freedoms. The debate over Cromwell's legacy reflects the complexity of history itself, with multiple interpretations coexisting and evolving over time.  In conclusion, the recognition of Oliver Cromwell's legacy is a multifaceted and evolving process that continues to captivate historians and scholars alike. While his achievements as a military leader and statesman are undeniable, his controversial actions and policies have sparked intense debate and controversy. As we grapple with the complexities of Cromwell's legacy, it is essential to approach the topic with nuance and critical thinking, recognizing both his successes and shortcomings in shaping the course of English history. Ultimately, the legacy of Oliver Cromwell serves as a reminder of the enduring impact of individual actions on the trajectory of nations and societies.""","937"
"Ford Henry Jones","""The Senate having refused to confirm a certain appointee, he declared that the opposition had 'its rise in an overwhelming greed for the patronage which may attach to the place,' and that the practical effect of such opposition was to perpetuate 'the practice of unblushing peculation.' What he said was quite true and it was the kind of truth that hurt. The brusqueness of his official style and the censoriousness of his language infused even more personal bitterness into the opposition which developed within his own party than in that felt in the ranks of the opposing party. At the same time, these traits delighted a growing body of reformers hostile to both the regular parties. These 'Mugwumps,' as they were called, were as a class so addicted to personal invective that it was said of them with as much truth as wit that they brought malice into politics without even the excuse of partisanship. But it was probably the enthusiastic support of this class which turned the scale in New York in the presidential election of 884. In the national conventions of that year, there was an unusually small amount of factional strife. In the Republican convention, President Arthur was a candidate, but party sentiment was so strong for Blaine that he led Arthur on the first ballot and was nominated on the fourth by a large majority. In the Democratic convention, Cleveland was nominated on the second ballot. Meanwhile, his opponents had organized a new party from which more was expected than it actually accomplished. It assumed the title Anti-Monopoly and chose the notorious demagogue, General Benjamin F. Butler, as its candidate for President. During this campaign, the satirical cartoon attained a power and an effectiveness difficult to realize now that it has become an ordinary feature of journalism, equally available for any school of opinion. But it so happened that the rise of Cleveland in politics coincided with the artistic career of Joseph Keppler, who came to this country from Vienna and who for some years supported himself chiefly as an actor in Western theatrical companies. He had studied drawing in Vienna and had contributed cartoons to periodicals in that city. After some unsuccessful ventures in illustrated journalism, he started a pictorial weekly in New York in 875/8. It was originally printed in German, but in less than a year it was issued also in English. It was not until 879 that it sprang into general notice through Keppler's success in reproducing lithographed designs in color. Meanwhile, the artist was feeling his way from the old style caricature, crowded with figures with overhead loops of explanatory text, to designs possessing an artistic unity expressive of an idea plain enough to tell its own story. He had matured both his mechanical resources and his artistic method by the time the campaign of 884 came on, and he had founded a school which could apply the style to American politics with aptness superior to his own. It was Bernhard Gillam, who, working in the new Keppler style, produced a series of cartoons whose tremendous impressiveness was universally recognized. Blaine was depicted as the tattooed man and was exhibited in that character in all sorts of telling situations. While on the stump during the campaign, Blaine had sometimes literally to wade through campaign documents assailing his personal integrity, and phrases culled from them were chanted in public processions. One of the features of a great parade of business men of New York was a periodical chorus of 'Burn this letter,' suiting the action to the word and thus making a striking pyrotechnic display. But the cartoons reached people who would never have been touched by campaign documents or by campaign processions. The allusion was to the Mulligan letters, which had been made public by Mr. Blaine himself when it had been charged that they contained evidence of corrupt business dealings. The disclosure had been made four years before and ample opportunity had existed for instituting proceedings if the case warranted it, but nothing was done except to nurse the scandal for campaign use. Notwithstanding the exceptional violence and novel ingenuity of the attacks made upon him, Blaine met them with such ability and address that everywhere he augmented the ordinary strength of his party, and his eventual defeat was generally attributed to an untoward event among his own adherents at the close of the campaign. At a political reception in the interest of Blaine among New York clergymen, the Reverend Dr. Burchard spoke of the Democratic party as 'the party of rum, Romanism, and rebellion.' Unfortunately Blaine did not hear him distinctly enough to repudiate this slur upon the religious belief of millions of American citizens, and alienation of sentiment caused by the tactless and intolerant remark could easily account for Blaine's defeat by a small margin. He was only 149 votes behind Cleveland in New York in a poll of over,25/8,00 votes, and only 3,05/8 votes behind in a national poll of over,00,00 votes for the leading candidates. Of course Cleveland in his turn was a target of calumny, and in his case the end of the campaign did not bring the customary relief. He was pursued to the end of his public career by active, ingenious, resourceful, personal spite and steady malignity of political opposition from interests whose enmity he had incurred while Governor of New York. The situation which confronted Cleveland when he became President was so complicated and embarrassing that perhaps even the most sagacious and resourceful statesman could not have coped with it successfully, though it is the characteristic of genius to accomplish the impossible. But Cleveland was no genius; he was not even a man of marked talent. He was stanch, plodding, laborious, and dutiful; but he was lacking in ability to penetrate to the heart of obscure political problems and to deal with primary causes rather than with effects. The great successes of his administration were gained in particular problems whose significance had already been clearly defined. In this field, Cleveland's resolute and energetic performance of duty had splendid results. At the time of Cleveland's inauguration as President, the Senate claimed an extent of authority which, if allowed to go unchallenged, would have turned the Presidency into an office much like that of the doge of Venice, one of ceremonial dignity without real power. 'The Federalist'--that matchless collection of constitutional essays written by Hamilton, Madison, and Jay--laid down the doctrine that 'against the enterprising ambition' of the legislative department 'the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions.' But some of the precautions taken in framing the Constitution proved ineffectual from the start. The right conferred upon the President to recommend to the consideration of Congress 'such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient,' was emptied of practical importance by the success of Congress in interpreting it as meaning no more than that the President may request Congress to take a subject into consideration. In practice, Congress considers only such measures as are recommended by its own committees. The framers of the Constitution took special pains to fortify the President's position by the veto power, which is treated at length in the Constitution. By a special clause, the veto power was extended to 'every order, resolution or vote. except on a question of adjournment'--a clause which apparently should enable the President to strike off the 'riders' continually put upon appropriation bills to coerce executive action; but no President has ventured to exercise this authority. Although the Senate was joined to the President as an advisory council in appointments to office, it was explained in 'The Federalist' that 'there will be no exertion of choice on the part of Senators.' Nevertheless, the Senate has claimed and exercised the right to dictate appointments. While thus successfully encroaching upon the authority of the President, the Senate had also been signally successful in encroaching upon the authority of the House. The framers of the Constitution anticipated for the House a masterful career like that of the House of Commons, and they feared that the Senate could not protect itself in the discharge of its own functions; so, although the traditional principle that all revenue bills should originate in the House was taken over into the Constitution, it was modified by the proviso that 'the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.' This right to propose amendments has been improved by the Senate until the prerogative of the House has been reduced to an empty form. Any money bill may be made over by amendment in the Senate, and when contests have followed, the Senate has been so successful in imposing its will upon the House that the House has acquired the habit of submission. Not long before the election of Cleveland, as has been pointed out, this habitual deference of the House had enabled the Senate to originate a voluminous tariff act in the form of an amendment to the Internal Revenue Bill voted by the House. In addition to these extensions of power through superior address in management, the ascendancy of the Senate was fortified by positive law. In 867, when President Johnson fell out with the Republican leaders in Congress, a Tenure of Office Act was passed over his veto, which took away from the President the power of making removals except by permission of the Senate.""","""Political conflicts and corruption in America""","1887","""Political conflicts and corruption in America have been longstanding issues that have shaped the country's governance and impacted the trust of its citizens. The intricate relationship between political conflicts and corruption often intertwines, leading to a complex dynamic that influences policy-making, public perception, and the overall functioning of democracy. Understanding the roots and consequences of these challenges is crucial for addressing and effectively combatting them.  At the core of political conflicts in America lies the divergence of ideologies, interests, and values among political parties and within the government itself. Partisan polarization has intensified in recent decades, contributing to gridlock and animosity between Democrats and Republicans. The inability to find common ground on key issues such as healthcare, immigration, and climate change has resulted in legislative stalemates, government shutdowns, and a lack of meaningful progress on critical policy areas. This ideological gulf has fueled a climate where compromise is viewed as a sign of weakness rather than a necessary component of democracy.  Moreover, the influence of money in politics has exacerbated political conflicts by amplifying the voices of special interest groups and wealthy donors over those of ordinary citizens. The rise of political action committees (PACs) and super PACs has allowed corporations and affluent individuals to pour significant sums of money into campaigns, influencing election outcomes and policy decisions. This financial influence has led to a system where politicians prioritize the interests of their donors over the needs of their constituents, further widening the gap between the government and the governed.  Corruption in America manifests in various forms, from bribery and embezzlement to cronyism and nepotism. The revolving door between government positions and corporate roles has created a system where public officials often prioritize personal gain or the interests of private entities over the public good. The lack of transparency and accountability in government operations has enabled corrupt practices to persist, eroding the public's trust in political institutions.  One notable example of political corruption in recent years is the influence of special interests in shaping healthcare policy. Pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers have lobbied extensively to maintain the status quo, prioritizing profits over affordable and accessible healthcare for all Americans. The result has been a healthcare system plagued by exorbitant costs, limited coverage, and stark health disparities, leaving many vulnerable individuals without adequate care.  The issue of corruption extends beyond policy-making and into the realm of electoral processes. Voter suppression tactics, gerrymandering, and disinformation campaigns have undermined the integrity of elections and disenfranchised marginalized communities. The erosion of trust in the electoral system poses a significant threat to the foundation of democracy, as citizens question the fairness and legitimacy of their government representatives.  Addressing political conflicts and corruption in America requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses root causes while promoting accountability and transparency. Campaign finance reform, including measures to limit the influence of money in politics, is essential to leveling the playing field and ensuring that elected officials represent the interests of all constituents. Strengthening ethical standards and enforcement mechanisms for public officials can help deter corrupt behavior and rebuild trust in government institutions.  Furthermore, fostering a culture of bipartisanship and constructive dialogue is crucial for overcoming political conflicts and finding common ground on pressing issues. Encouraging civil discourse, promoting media literacy, and investing in civic education can empower citizens to demand integrity and accountability from their leaders. By actively engaging in the democratic process and holding elected officials accountable, individuals can drive meaningful change and work towards a more transparent and inclusive political system.  In conclusion, political conflicts and corruption in America pose significant challenges to the health of democracy and the well-being of its citizens. By understanding the underlying factors contributing to these issues and taking proactive steps to address them, we can pave the way for a more equitable, just, and responsive government. It is incumbent upon all stakeholders – from policymakers and advocates to ordinary citizens – to work together towards a future where integrity, transparency, and the common good guide political decision-making in America.""","782"
"Adams Alton D ","""As already pointed out, the use of separate circuits for each sub-station, and for lighting and power loads at each sub-station in very long transmission systems, is often impracticable. Even in comparatively short transmissions the multiplication of circuits and the use of rather small and mechanically weak conductors increased the first cost of installation and the subsequent expense of inspection and repairs. An objection to operation with a single circuit in a transmission line that supplies widely separated sub-stations with lighting, power, and railway loads is the consequent difficulty of pressure regulation on the distribution lines at each sub-station. Such a transmission line necessarily delivers energy at different and fluctuating voltages at the several sub-stations, and these fluctuations are of course reproduced on the secondary side of the step-down transformers. Fortunately, however, the use of synchronous motor generators, either in place of or in connection with static transformers, goes far to solve the problem of pressure regulation for distribution circuits supplied with energy from transmission lines. This is due to the well-known fact that with constant frequency the speed of rotation for a synchronous motor is constant without regard to fluctuations in the applied voltage or changes in its load. With a constant speed at the motor and its connected generator it is of course easy to deliver current at constant voltage to the distribution lines. This constancy of speed makes the synchronous motor generator a favorite in large transmission systems with both power and lighting loads. The satisfactory lighting service in Buffalo, operated with energy transmitted from Niagara Falls, seems to be due in some measure to the use of synchronous motor generators at the sub-station in Buffalo, whence lighting circuits are supplied. As above stated, the three circuits that make up the transmission line between Niagara Falls and Buffalo are operated in multiple, and in the latter place there is a large load of both railway and stationary motors. As the three circuits are operated in multiple, they of course amount to only a single circuit so far as fluctuations of voltage due to changes in these several sorts of loads are concerned. According to vol. xviii., A. I. E. E., pages 25/8 and following, the load on the transmission system at Buffalo in 901 was made up of about,00 horse-power in railway motors,,00 horse-power in induction motors, and,00 horse-power divided up between series arc lamps, constant pressure incandescent lamps, and continuous current motors. The railway load is operated through step-down transformers and rotary converters. The induction motors are connected either to the,00-volt secondary circuits of the step-down transformers or to service transformers supplied by these circuits. On these railway and stationary motor loads there is of course no necessity for close pressure regulation. Series arc lamps are operated through step-down transformers and synchronous motors direct-connected to constant continuous current dynamos. Continuous current stationary motors draw power from the transmission lines through step-down transformers and rotary converters, like the railway load. For the,00 volt circuits that supply service transformers for commercial arc and incandescent lighting the transmitted energy passes through step-down transformers and synchronous motor-generators. These motor-generators raise the frequency from twenty-five to sixty cycles per second. Finally the continuous current three-wire system for incandescent lighting at about 5/80 volts between outside wires is operated through step-down transformers and synchronous motors direct-connected to continuous current generators. For this last-named service rotary converters were at first tried, but were found to be impracticable because voltage fluctuations on the transmission reproduced on the continuous-current circuits by the rotary converters. Since the adoption of motor-generators this fluctuation of the service voltage is no longer present. Another case in which synchronous motor-generators deliver power from a transmission line that carries both a lighting and a motor load is that of the Shawinigan sub-station in Montreal. At this sub-station the 5/8-mile transmission line from the generating plant at Shawinigan Falls terminates. As already pointed out, this line is composed of a single three-phase circuit of aluminum conductors, each of which has a cross section of 83,5/80 circular mils. In the Montreal sub-station the thirty-cycle, three-phase current from Shawinigan Falls is delivered to transformers that lower the voltage to,00. The current then goes to five synchronous motor-generators of,00 horse-power capacity each, and is there converted to sixty-three cycles per second, two-phase, at the same voltage. This converted current passes onto the distribution lines of the local electrical supply system in Montreal, which also draws energy from two other water-power plants, and is devoted to lighting, stationary motors, or to the street railway work, as may be required. Though separate local distribution circuits are devoted to these several loads, the fluctuations in the stationary and railway motor work necessarily react on the voltage of the transmission line and transformers at the sub-station. By the use of the synchronous motor-generators the lighting circuits are protected from these pressure variations. As the numbers of sub-stations at different points on long transmission lines increase, and stationary motor and railway loads at each become more common, it is to be expected that the use of synchronous motor-generators for lighting service will be much more frequent than at present. With such use there will disappear one of the reasons for the multiplication of transmission circuits. Where several transmission circuits connect a generating plant with a single sub-station, or with several sub-stations in the same general direction, it is desirable to have switches so arranged that two or more circuits may be combined as one, or so that any circuit that ordinarily operates a certain load or sub-station may be devoted to another when occasion requires. For this purpose transfer switches on each circuit are necessary at generating plants, sub-stations, and often at switch-houses. These transfer switches will ordinarily be of the knife type, and intended for manual operation when the circuits to which they are connected are not in use. As such switches are exposed to the full voltage of transmission, the insulation of their conducting parts should be very high. In the extensive transmission system between the power-plants at Spier Falls and Mechanicsville and the sub-stations at Troy, Albany, and Schenectady, N. Y., a transfer switch of highly insulated construction has been much used. The two blades of this switch move independently of each other, but both are mounted between the same metal clips. Each blade is of two by one-quarter inch drawn copper rod, and the clips supporting the two blades are mounted on top of a circular metal cap four and three-quarter inches in outside diameter and two inches high, that is cemented over the top of a large, double petticoat, porcelain line insulator. Clips into which these copper blades are swung in closing the switch are also mounted in caps carried by insulators in the way just described. Each of these insulators is mounted on a large wooden pin, and these pins are secured in timbers at the points where the switches are wanted. This construction of switches gives ample insulation for the line voltage of 0,00 in this system. By means of the transfer switches just described, either of the transmission circuits leaving the Spier Falls power-plant may be connected to any one of the ten generators and ten groups of transformers there. At the Saratoga switch-house, any one of the twelve conductors, making up the four three-phase circuits from Spier Falls may be connected to any one of the eighteen conductors making up the six three-phase circuits that go south to Saratoga, Watervliet, and Schenectady sub-stations, in the way indicated by the drawing. So again at the Watervliet sub-station, where energy at 6,00 volts is received from Spier Falls and energy at 0,00 volts from Mechanicsville, any single conductor from either of these water-power plants may be connected, either directly or through a transformer, with either conductor running to the railway and lighting sub-stations about Albany and Troy. Where several transmission circuits are employed, this complete flexibility of connection evidently adds materially to the convenience and reliability of operation.""","""Synchronous Motor Generators in Transmission Systems""","1648","""Synchronous motor generators play a crucial role in modern transmission systems, providing stability and efficiency to the power grid. These machines are vital components in converting mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Their synchronous operation with the grid frequency ensures reliable power generation and enables seamless integration with the existing transmission infrastructure.  One of the primary advantages of synchronous motor generators is their ability to maintain a constant speed of rotation, which is synchronized with the frequency of the electric grid. This synchronous operation allows these generators to deliver consistent power output, making them ideal for large-scale applications such as power plants and utility-scale renewable energy systems.  In transmission systems, synchronous motor generators are commonly used in power plants to convert mechanical energy, often from steam turbines or gas turbines, into electrical energy. These generators are designed to operate at a specific speed to match the grid frequency, typically 50 or 60 Hz, depending on the region. By maintaining synchronization with the grid, synchronous motor generators help stabilize the system frequency and voltage, ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply to consumers.  One key feature of synchronous motor generators is their ability to provide reactive power support to the grid. Reactive power is essential for maintaining voltage levels within acceptable limits and improving system stability. Synchronous generators can supply or absorb reactive power as needed to support the grid and compensate for fluctuations in load demand.  In addition to their role in traditional power generation, synchronous motor generators are also employed in renewable energy systems, such as wind farms and hydroelectric plants. These generators help convert the intermittent mechanical energy from renewable sources into stable electrical power that can be seamlessly integrated into the grid. Their synchronous operation ensures smooth grid interaction and minimizes disruptions to the power supply.  Synchronous motor generators are highly efficient machines, capable of operating at a wide range of power outputs while maintaining stable performance. Their synchronous operation and ability to provide reactive power support make them valuable assets in transmission systems, contributing to grid stability and reliability. These generators are designed to withstand varying operating conditions and maintain high efficiency levels over their operational lifespan.  Maintenance of synchronous motor generators is essential to ensure their reliable operation and longevity. Regular inspections, testing, and lubrication are key aspects of generator maintenance. Periodic checks of insulation resistance, cooling systems, and electrical connections can help identify potential issues early and prevent costly downtime. Proper maintenance practices can extend the lifespan of synchronous motor generators and ensure optimal performance throughout their service life.  In conclusion, synchronous motor generators play a critical role in transmission systems by providing stable and efficient power generation. Their synchronous operation, ability to provide reactive power support, and high efficiency make them indispensable components of power plants and renewable energy systems. By maintaining grid synchronization and supporting system stability, synchronous motor generators help ensure a reliable power supply for consumers and contribute to the overall resilience of the electrical grid.""","555"
"Newman John Henry","""Accordingly, virtue being only one kind of beauty, the principle which determines what is virtuous is, not conscience, but taste. 'Could we once convince ourselves,' he says, 'of what is in itself so evident, viz., that in the very nature of things there must of necessity be the foundation of a right and wrong taste, as well in respect of inward character of features as of outward person, behaviour, and action, we should be far more ashamed of ignorance and wrong judgment in the former than in the latter of these subjects.{ } One who aspires to the character of a man of breeding and politeness is careful to form his judgment of arts and sciences upon right models of perfection.{ } He takes particular care to turn his eye from every thing which is gaudy, luscious, and of false taste. Nor is he less careful to turn his ear from every sort of music, besides that which is of the best manner and truest harmony. 'Twere to be wished we had the same regard to a right taste in life and manners.{ } If civility and humanity be a taste; if brutality, insolence, riot, be in the same manner a taste, { } who would not endeavour to force nature as well in this respect as in what relates to a taste or judgment in other arts and sciences?' Sometimes he distinctly contrasts this taste with principle and conscience, and gives it the preference over them. 'After all,' he says, 'tis not merely what we call principle, but a taste, which governs men. They may think for certain, 'This is right,' or 'that wrong;' they may believe 'this is a virtue,' or 'that a sin;' 'this is punishable by man,' or 'that by God;' yet if the savour of things lies cross to honesty, if the fancy be florid, and the appetite high towards the subaltern beauties and lower orders of worldly symmetries and proportions, the conduct will infallibly turn this latter way.' Thus, somewhat like a Jansenist, he makes the superior pleasure infallibly conquer, and implies that, neglecting principle, we have but to train the taste to a kind of beauty higher than sensual. He adds: 'Even conscience, I fear, such as is owing to religious discipline, will make but a slight figure, when this taste is set amiss.' And hence the well-known doctrine of this author, that ridicule is the test of truth; for truth and virtue being beauty, and falsehood and vice deformity, and the feeling inspired by deformity being that of derision, as that inspired by beauty is admiration, it follows that vice is not a thing to weep about, but to laugh at. 'Nothing is ridiculous,' he says, 'but what is deformed; nor is any thing proof against raillery but what is handsome and just. And therefore 'tis the hardest thing in the world to deny fair honesty the use of this weapon, which can never bear an edge against herself, and bears against every thing contrary.' And hence again, conscience, which intimates a Law-giver, being superseded by a moral taste or sentiment, which has no sanction beyond the constitution of our nature, it follows that our great rule is to contemplate ourselves, if we would gain a standard of life and morals. Thus he has entitled one of his Treatises a 'Soliloquy,' with the motto, 'Nec te qusiveris extra;' and he observes, 'The chief interest of ambition, avarice, corruption, and every sly insinuating vice, is to prevent this interview and familiarity of discourse, which is consequent upon close retirement and inward recess. 'Tis the grand artifice of villainy and lewdness, as well as of superstition and bigotry, to put us upon terms of greater distance and formality with ourselves, and evade our proving method of soliloquy.{ } A passionate lover, whatever solitude he may affect, can never be truly by himself.{ } 'Tis the same reason which keeps the imaginary saint or mystic from being capable of this entertainment. Instead of looking narrowly into his own nature and mind, that he may be no longer a mystery to himself, he is taken up with the contemplation of other mysterious natures, which he never can explain or comprehend.'. Taking these passages as specimens of what I call the Religion of Philosophy, it is obvious to observe that there is no doctrine contained in them which is not in a certain sense true; yet, on the other hand, that almost every statement is perverted and made false, because it is not the whole truth. They are exhibitions of truth under one aspect, and therefore insufficient; conscience is most certainly a moral sense, but it is more; vice again, is a deformity, but it is worse. Lord Shaftesbury may insist, if he will, that simple and solitary fear cannot effect a moral conversion, and we are not concerned to answer him; but he will have a difficulty in proving that any real conversion follows from a doctrine which makes virtue a mere point of good taste, and vice vulgar and ungentlemanlike. Such a doctrine is essentially superficial, and such will be its effects. It has no better measure of right and wrong than that of visible beauty and tangible fitness. Conscience indeed inflicts an acute pang, but that pang, forsooth, is irrational, and to reverence it is an illiberal superstition. But, if we will make light of what is deepest within us, nothing is left but to pay homage to what is more upon the surface. To seem becomes to be; what looks fair will be good, what causes offence will be evil; virtue will be what pleases, vice what pains. As well may we measure virtue by utility as by such a rule. Nor is this an imaginary apprehension; we all must recollect the celebrated sentiment into which a great and wise man was betrayed, in the glowing eloquence of his valediction to the spirit of chivalry. 'It is gone,' cries Mr. Burke; 'that sensibility of principle, that chastity of honour, which felt a stain like a wound; which inspired courage, while it mitigated ferocity; which ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice lost half its evil by losing all its grossness.' In the last clause of this beautiful sentence we have too apt an illustration of the ethical temperament of a civilized age. It is detection, not the sin, which is the crime; private life is sacred, and inquiry into it is intolerable; and decency is virtue. Scandals, vulgarities, whatever shocks, whatever disgusts, are offences of the first order. Drinking and swearing, squalid poverty, improvidence, laziness, slovenly disorder, make up the idea of profligacy: poets may say any thing, however wicked, with impunity; works of genius may be read without danger or shame, whatever their principles; fashion, celebrity, the beautiful, the heroic, will suffice to force any evil upon the community. The splendours of a court, and the charms of good society, wit, imagination, taste, and high breeding, the prestige of rank, and the resources of wealth, are a screen, an instrument, and an apology for vice and irreligion. And thus at length we find, surprising as the change may be, that that very refinement of Intellectualism, which began by repelling sensuality, ends by excusing it. Under the shadow indeed of the Church, and in its due development, Philosophy does service to the cause of morality; but, when it is strong enough to have a will of its own, and is lifted up with an idea of its own importance, and attempts to form a theory, and to lay down a principle, and to carry out a system of ethics, and undertakes the moral education of the man, then it does but abet evils to which at first it seemed instinctively opposed. True Religion is slow in growth, and, when once planted, is difficult of dislodgement; but its intellectual counterfeit has no root in itself: it springs up suddenly, it suddenly withers. It appeals to what is in nature, and it falls under the dominion of the old Adam. Then, like dethroned princes, it keeps up a state and majesty, when it has lost the real power. Deformity is its abhorrence; accordingly, since it cannot dissuade men from vice, therefore in order to escape the sight of its deformity, it embellishes it. It 'skins and films the ulcerous place,' which it cannot probe or heal, 'Whiles rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen.' And from this shallowness of philosophical Religion it comes to pass that its disciples seem able to fulfil certain precepts of Christianity more readily and exactly than Christians themselves. St. Paul, as I have said, gives us a pattern of evangelical perfection; he draws the Christian character in its most graceful form, and its most beautiful hues. He discourses of that charity which is patient and meek, humble and single-minded, disinterested, contented, and persevering. He tells us to prefer each the other before himself, to give way to each other, to abstain from rude words and evil speech, to avoid self-conceit, to be calm and grave, to be cheerful and happy, to observe peace with all men, truth and justice, courtesy and gentleness, all that is modest, amiable, virtuous, and of good repute. Such is St. Paul's exemplar of the Christian in his external relations; and, I repeat, the school of the world seems to send out living copies of this typical excellence with greater success than the Church. At this day the 'gentleman' is the creation, not of Christianity, but of civilization. But the reason is obvious. The world is content with setting right the surface of things; the Church aims at regenerating the very depths of the heart. She ever begins with the beginning; and, as regards the multitude of her children, is never able to get beyond the beginning, but is continually employed in laying the foundation. She is engaged with what is essential, as previous and as introductory to the ornamental and the attractive.""","""Moral philosophy and judgment of virtue.""","2130","""Moral philosophy, a branch of philosophy that explores concepts surrounding ethics, values, and what is considered right or wrong, has been a central focus of philosophical inquiry for centuries. At the heart of moral philosophy lies the evaluation of virtues, which are qualities or characteristics that are deemed morally good and desirable. Virtues play a crucial role in shaping our character, guiding our actions, and ultimately defining our moral worth. Through an examination of virtue ethics, the judgment of virtue, and the implications for personal and societal well-being, we can delve into the complexities of moral philosophy and its impact on our lives.  Virtue ethics, a moral theory that places emphasis on the development of moral character, is deeply rooted in the works of ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato. Unlike deontological ethics, which focuses on duties and rules, or consequentialist ethics, which prioritizes outcomes and consequences, virtue ethics directs attention towards the cultivation of virtues within individuals. Central to virtue ethics is the idea that being a good person involves embodying and practicing virtuous qualities such as courage, honesty, compassion, and wisdom. These virtues are viewed as intrinsic goods that contribute to human flourishing and overall well-being.  The judgment of virtue entails evaluating individuals based on the virtues they possess and display in their actions and decisions. Virtue ethics suggests that morality is not solely determined by adherence to rules or achieving specific outcomes but is rather a reflection of one's character and the habitual expression of virtues in daily life. When assessing someone's moral worth, we consider not just what they do, but who they are as a person and the values they uphold. For example, a person who demonstrates honesty consistently in various situations is regarded as possessing the virtue of truthfulness, which contributes positively to their moral character.  In evaluating virtue, several key considerations come into play. First and foremost is the notion of moral relativism versus moral absolutism. Moral relativism posits that ethical standards are context-dependent and vary across different cultures or individuals, while moral absolutism argues for universal moral principles that apply regardless of circumstances. When it comes to judging virtue, understanding the cultural, societal, and personal contexts in which virtues are expressed is essential. What may be considered a virtue in one culture or community could be viewed differently in another, highlighting the nuanced nature of moral judgments.  Furthermore, the role of intentions versus outcomes in assessing virtue is another critical aspect. While the consequences of actions are undoubtedly important, virtue ethics emphasizes the significance of intentions behind actions. A morally virtuous individual acts out of a genuine desire to do what is right, guided by virtuous intentions rather than solely focusing on achieving favorable outcomes. This distinction underscores the importance of understanding the motives and values that drive human behavior when making judgments about virtue.  Moreover, the development of virtues is seen as an ongoing process that requires reflection, practice, and self-improvement. Virtue ethics views moral education and cultivation as vital components in fostering virtuous character traits. By engaging in moral reasoning, seeking guidance from ethical role models, and actively practicing virtues in everyday life, individuals can nurture their moral character and strive towards becoming virtuous individuals. Cultivating virtues is not a one-time achievement but a lifelong journey of self-discovery and moral growth.  The judgment of virtue extends beyond individual character assessment to considerations of societal implications and the common good. In a broader social context, virtues are essential for fostering harmonious relationships, promoting justice, and sustaining a flourishing community. Communities that prioritize virtues such as fairness, compassion, and respect are more likely to thrive and exhibit qualities of social cohesion and solidarity. Conversely, societies that lack virtues or promote vices such as greed, dishonesty, or cruelty are more prone to division, conflict, and moral decay.  It is worth noting that the judgment of virtue is not without its challenges and complexities. Virtues are multifaceted and may sometimes come into conflict with each other, posing dilemmas for individuals facing difficult moral decisions. For instance, a situation may require a trade-off between being truthful and showing compassion, leading to a moral dilemma where virtues seem to clash. In such instances, the virtue ethicist must navigate the tension between competing virtues and consider the context to determine the most ethically sound course of action.  Additionally, the subjectivity of moral judgments and the potential for biases in evaluating virtue raise questions about the objectivity and universality of virtuous traits. Different observers may have varying interpretations of what constitutes a virtuous act or character, influenced by their cultural background, upbringing, personal beliefs, and experiences. Recognizing and addressing these biases is crucial in ensuring fair and impartial evaluations of virtue that transcend individual prejudices and preferences.  In conclusion, moral philosophy and the judgment of virtue provide a framework for examining the complexities of ethics, character, and human behavior. Virtue ethics offers a compelling perspective on morality that focuses on cultivating virtuous qualities and evaluating individuals based on their character and intentions. By engaging in moral reflection, nurturing virtues, and considering the societal impact of virtuous behavior, we can deepen our understanding of ethics and strive towards a more virtuous and morally exemplary way of life. Ultimately, the judgment of virtue invites us to reflect on what it means to be a good person, live a meaningful life, and contribute positively to the well-being of ourselves and others.""","1063"
"Buffon Georges Louis Leclerc comte de","""Malpighius then gives the description of the vessels and course of the blood, and reasonably supposes that, though the heart does not beat before thirty-eight or forty hours incubation, it still existed before that time, like the other parts of the chicken; but on examining the heart in a dark room, he discovered not the least glimpse of light to proceed from it, as Harvey insinuates. At the end of two days the chicken is seen floating in the liquor of the amnios; in which the head, composed of vesicles, is turned on one side; the back bone and vertebr are lengthened; the heart, which then hung out of the breast, beat three times; for the fluid it contains is impelled into the ventricles of the heart, from thence into the arteries, and afterwards into the umbilical vessels. He remarks, that having separated the chick from the white of the egg, the motion of the heart still continued for a whole day. After two days and fourteen hours, or sixty-two hours of incubation, the chicken, although grown stronger, remained with its head bent downwards in the liquor, contained by the amnios; the veins and arteries were seen among the vessels of the brain; the lineaments of the eyes, and the spinal marrow, also appear extending the length of the vertebr. At the end of the third day the head of the chicken appeared crooked; besides the eyes five vessels were seen in the head filled with a liquid matter; the first outlines of the wings and thighs were to be distinguished, and the body began to gather flesh; the pupil of the eye, and also the crystalline and vitreous humour were discernible. At the fourth day the vesicles of the brain were nearer each other; the eminences of the vertebr were more prominent, the wings and thighs assumed a greater solidity as they increased in length; the whole body, covered with a jelly-like flesh, was now surrounded within the body by a thin membrane, and the umbilical vessels that unite the animal to the yolk, appeared to come from the abdomen. On the fifth and sixth days the vesicles of the brain began to be covered; the spinal marrow, divided into two parts, began to take solidity and stretch along the trunk; the wings and thighs lengthened; the feet began to spread; the belly was closed up and tumid; the liver was distinctly seen, and appeared of a dusky white; the ventricles of the heart were discerned to beat very distinctly; the body of the chicken was covered with a skin, and the traces of the feathers were visible; the seventh day the head appeared very large, the brain was entirely covered with its membranes; the beak began to appear betwixt the eyes, and the wings, the thighs, and the legs had acquired their perfect figure. I shall not follow Malpighius any farther, as the remainder relates only to the expansion of the parts till the twenty-first day, when the chicken breaks the shell with its beak; though before that time it is heard to chirrup in its imprisonment. The heart is the last part which receives its proper form, for it is eleven days before the arteries are seen to join, and the ventricles become perfectly conformable and united. We are now in a condition to judge of the value of Harvey's experiments and observations. There is great appearance this anatomist did not make use of a microscope, which in fact was not brought to perfection in his days, or he would not have asserted there was no difference between the cicatrice of an impregnated and an unimpregnated egg; he would not have said the seed of the male produced no alteration in the egg, especially in the cicatrice; he would not have affirmed that nothing was perceptible till the third day, that the animated speck was the first that appeared, and into which the white speck was changed. He would have seen that the white speck was a ball which contained the whole apparatus of generation, and that every part of the foetus are there from the moment the hen has connection with the cock. He would also have learnt, that without this connection it contains only an unshapen mass, which could never become animated, because in fact it is not organized like an animal, and because it is only when this mass, which we must look upon as an assemblage of the organic particles of the female semen, is penetrated by the organic particles of the male semen, that there results from it an animal, which is formed at the moment, but whose motion is imperceptible till the end of forty hours after: he would not have asserted that the heart is first formed, and that the other parts are joined to it by a juxta-position, since it is evident from Malpighius's observations, that the outlines of every part are all immediately formed, but only appear in proportion as they dilate; on the whole, if he had seen what Malpighius saw, he would not have affirmed that no impression of the male seed remained in the eggs, and that it was only by contagion that they are fecundated, &c. It is also just to remark, that what Harvey has said on the parts of the generation of a cock is not exact; he asserts that the cock has no genital member, and that there is no intromission; nevertheless it is certain that this animal, instead of one has two, and that they both act at the same time, and which action is a very strong compression, if not a true copulation; and it is by this double organ that the cock emits the seminal liquor into the matrix of the hen. See Reyn. Graaf, page 42. Let us now compare the experiments made by Harvey on hinds with those of De Graaf on doe rabbits; we shall find that although De Graaf supposes, with Harvey, that all animals proceed from eggs, yet there is a great difference in the mode which these two anatomists have observed in the first steps of formation, or rather expansion, of the foetuses of viviparous animals. After having exerted every effort to establish, by reasons drawn from comparative anatomy, that the testicles of viviparous females are real ovaries, De Graaf explains how the eggs are loosened from the ovaries and fall into the horns of the matrix; he then relates what he observed in a rabbit, which he dissected half an hour after copulation. The horns of the matrix, he says, were more red than before, but no other change in the rest of the parts: there was also no appearance of any male seed, neither in the vagina, matrix, nor horns of the matrix. Having dissected another six hours after copulation he observed the follicules, or coats, which he supposes contained the eggs in the ovary, ware become red, but found no male seed either in the ovaria or elsewhere. He dissected another twenty-four hours after copulation, and remarked in one ovarium three, and in the other five follicules that were changed, the transparency being become dark and red. In one dissected twenty-seven hours after copulation he perceived the horns of the womb had become more red and strictly embraced the ovaries. In another, that he opened forty hours after copulation, he found in one of the ovaries seven, follicules, and in the other three that were changed. Fifty-two hours after copulation he examined another and found one follicle changed in one of the ovaries and four in another, and having opened these follicules he found a glandular liquor, in the middle of which there was a small cavity, where he did not perceive any liquor, which made him suppose that the transparent liquor, commonly contained in the follicules, and which, he says, is enclosed in its own membranes, might have been separated by a kind of rupture: he searched after this matter in the passages, and in the horns of the matrix themselves, but he found none; he only perceived that the internal membrane of the horns of the matrix was very much swelled. In another, dissected three days after copulation, he observed that the superior extremity of the passage, which communicates with the horns of the matrix, strictly embraced the ovaries; and having separated it he perceived three follicules, longer and harder than usual. After searching with the greatest attention the passages above-mentioned he found in the right passage one egg, and in the right horn of the matrix two more, not bigger than a grain of mustard-seed: those little eggs were each closed in double membranes, and the inner one was filled with a very limpid liquor. Having examined the other ovarium he found four follicules that were changed, three of which were white and had a little liquor within them; but the fourth was of a darker colour, and contained no liquor, which made him judge that from this the egg had been separated. Pursuing his enquiries he found an egg in the superior extremity of the other horn, and exactly like those he had discovered in the right one. He says that the eggs which are separated from the ovary are ten times smaller than those which are fastened to it; and he thinks that this difference is occasioned from the eggs containing, when they are in the ovaries, another matter, and that is the glandular liquor he remarked in the molecules. Four days after copulation he opened another, and found in one of the ovaries four, and in the other three follicules, emptied of their eggs; and in the horns corresponding to these he found an equal number of eggs. These eggs were larger than the first that he found three days after copulation, and were about the size of a small bird-shot; he also remarked that the internal membrane in these eggs was separated from the external, and appeared like a second egg in the first. In another, dissected five days after copulation, he found five empty follicules in the ovaries, and as many eggs in the matrix, to which they adhered.""","""Embryonic development of chickens and animals""","2076","""Embryonic development is a fascinating process that lays the foundation for the growth and formation of a living organism. In the case of chickens and other animals, this journey from a single cell to a fully-formed individual is complex and intricately regulated. Understanding the stages of embryonic development can provide valuable insights into the wonders of life itself. Let's delve into the remarkable journey of embryonic development in chickens and other animals.  The process of embryonic development begins with fertilization, where a sperm cell penetrates an egg cell, forming a zygote with a complete set of chromosomes. In chickens, fertilization usually occurs in the infundibulum of the oviduct, shortly after ovulation. The zygote undergoes rapid cell divisions through a process known as cleavage, resulting in the formation of a blastula. This early stage of development is crucial for establishing the basic body plan of the organism.  As the blastula continues to develop, it undergoes a process called gastrulation, where the three primary germ layers – ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm – are formed. These germ layers give rise to different tissues and organs in the body. In chickens, gastrulation leads to the formation of the primitive streak, a structure that establishes the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Cells from the epiblast migrate through the primitive streak to form the endoderm and mesoderm layers.  During the process of neurulation, the neural tube – the precursor to the brain and spinal cord – is formed from the ectoderm. This critical stage of development is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. In chickens, neurulation occurs around day 2.5 of incubation and marks the beginning of central nervous system development.  Throughout embryonic development, organogenesis takes place as different tissues and organs begin to form and differentiate. In chickens, the development of the amnion, allantois, and chorion – structures involved in respiration, waste excretion, and nutrient transfer – is crucial for the embryo's survival within the egg. The heart begins to beat around day 2-3 in chickens, marking the start of cardiovascular development.  As the embryo continues to grow and develop, limb buds form, and the external features of the organism become more defined. Feather follicles start to develop in chickens, signaling the beginning of feather formation. By day 21, a fully formed chick is ready to hatch from the egg, marking the end of embryonic development and the beginning of post-embryonic growth and maturation.  It is essential to note that the process of embryonic development is highly conserved among vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. While there are variations in the timing and specific mechanisms, the fundamental principles of embryogenesis remain remarkably similar across species.  Embryonic development is a tightly regulated process controlled by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. Any disruptions or abnormalities during development can lead to congenital malformations or developmental disorders. Studying embryonic development in animals not only provides insights into evolutionary biology and genetic regulation but also has significant implications for human health and reproduction.  In conclusion, the journey of embryonic development in chickens and other animals is a marvel of nature, showcasing the intricate processes that result in the creation of a new life. By unraveling the mysteries of embryogenesis, scientists can gain a deeper understanding of the origins of life and the remarkable intricacies of biological development.""","710"

Robert Boyle, The Works, London, 772, I, 48-49. Browne, op. cit., II, 61. II Robert Boyle as an Amateur Physician S. KING Robert Boyle was not a physician. To be sure, he had engaged in some casual anatomical studies, but he had not formally studied medicine and did not have a medical degree. Nevertheless, he engaged in what we would call medical practice as well as medical research and exerted a strong influence on the course of medicine during the latter seventeenth century, an influence prolonged well into the eighteenth. He lived during the period of exciting yet painful transition when medical theory and practice were undergoing a complete transformation towards what we may call the 'early modern' form. The transition, naturally gradual, extended over three centuries, but I wish to examine only a very small fragment of this period, namely, the third quarter of the seventeenth century. Boyle's first major work which dealt extensively with medical problems was the Usefulness of Experimental Philosophy. This work, although published in 663, had been written in two parts, the first much earlier than the second. Fulton indicates it had been drafted around 65/80, while Hall ascribes it to the period 647-648. This first part has relatively little to do with medicine; the references are few and rather incidental, and have significance only for the light they throw on 'natural philosophy' and 'natural religion.' The second part, however, written apparently not too long before publication, has a great deal to do with medicine and constitutes one of the important medical documents of the century. Deserving of mention is an earlier and minor work of Boyle, indeed, his first published writing, only recently identified. This work, apparently written in 649, bore the title 'An Invitation to a free and generous communication of Secrets and Receits in Physick,' and appeared anonymously in 65/85/8 as part of a volume entitled Chymical, Medicinal and Chirurgical Addresses Made to Samuel Hartlib, Esquire. For our purposes, it is significant as emphasizing his early interest in medicine. Boyle seems to have acquired most of his medical knowledge between, say, 649 and 662. It is worth recalling some of the trends and conflicts that formed the medical environment during this period. Among the major trends, first place, perhaps, must be given to Galenic doctrine, which had come under progressively severe attack. Moliere, who lived from 622 to 673, showed in his comedies the popular reaction to a system which, although dominant, was clearly crumbling. The cracks in the edifice even the layman could readily see. Nevertheless, Galenism had its strong supporters. Riverius, who lived from 5/889 to 65/85/8, was a staunch Galenist. An edition of his basic and clinical works was translated into English in 65/87, and Latin editions continued to be published well into the eighteenth century. Galenism, of course, had to withstand the great new discoveries in anatomy and physiology made by Vesalius, Aselli, Sanctonius, Harvey, and others, not to mention the host of great investigators who were more strictly contemporaries of Boyle. Galenism also faced the rivalry of chemistry. The so-called 'antimony war' in the earlier part of the century marked an important assault on Galenism, and the letters of the arch-conservative Guy us appreciate this period. However, even more important was the work of van Helmont, who developed and extended the doctrines of Paracelsus and represented a major force in seventeenth-century thought. Boyle was well acquainted with the writings of van Helmont, who, although his works fell into disrepute as the mechanical philosophy gradually took over, nevertheless in the middle of the seventeenth century was a highly significant figure. In 662 there appeared the English translation of his Oriatrike, while Latin editions continued to be published later in the century. In this connection I might also mention the subject of 'natural magic,' which had considerable significance for medicine. The best-known name is, perhaps, Giovanni Battista della Porta (5/845/8-615/8), whose books continued to be published, in Latin and English, during this period when Boyle was achieving maturity. Profound developments, of course, arose from the new mechanics and physics and their metaphysical background, for which I need only mention the names of Descartes, who died in 65/80, and Gassendi, who died in 65/85/8. And then there was also the new methodological approach, that critical empiricism whose most vocal exponent was Francis Bacon, which led directly to the founding of the Royal Society in 660 and its subsequent incorporation. These phases of seventeenth-century thought and activity I do not intend to take up. In this turbulent riptide of intellectual currents, Robert Boyle, without formal medical education, performed many medical functions, as a sometime practitioner, consultant, and researcher. Repeatedly he speaks of the patients whom he treated, and repeatedly he refers to practitioners who consulted him, or to whom he gave advice. In addition, through his interest in chemistry, he became an important experimental as well as clinical pharmacologist, and his researches in physiology indicate great stature in this field. If we were to draw a present-day comparison, we might point to investigators who had both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degrees, who had both clinical and laboratory training, and who practiced medicine partly in the clinical wards, partly in the experimental laboratories. Boyle, of course, did not have either degree, but he did have a status as the leading virtuoso of his day. The virtuoso has been the subject of a most extensive literature. He aroused considerable contemporary hostility and satire and his overall significance for medical science is probably slight, with a few striking exceptions. Robert Boyle is one of the great exceptions. First of all, the virtuoso was an amateur. In the literal sense the amateur loves the activities in which he engages, and in the figurative sense he remains independent of any Establishment. Not trained in any rigorous, prescribed discipline, he was not committed to any set doctrine. Furthermore, he was not restricted by the regulations which all Establishments employed to preserve their status, block opposition, and prevent competition. In many fields the Establishment took the form of a guild organization--in medicine, the Royal College of Physicians. Boyle was a wealthy and highly talented man who could pursue his own bent without needing to make concessions merely to earn a living. He remained quite independent of the cares which oppressed those less well endowed in worldly goods or native talent. Sometimes, of course, necessity can impose a discipline and rigor which ultimately may serve as a disguised benefit, but in the seventeenth century, when Boyle was active, the lack of systematic training and rigorous background seemed actually an advantage. Clinical chemistry and the broad areas which we can call experimental medicine had no tradition. Work in clinical chemistry, clinical pharmacology, and experimental physiology was essentially innovation. And since innovations are often made by those who are outside the Establishment and not bound by tradition, we need feel no surprise that the experimental approach could make great progress under the aegis of amateurs. Necessarily the work was rather unsystematic and undisciplined, but system and discipline could arise only when the new approach had already achieved some measure of success. Through the casual approach of amateurs this necessary foundation could be built. Boyle, as a clinician, remained on excellent terms with medical practitioners. For one thing, he took great care not to compete with them. As stated, he 'was careful to decline the occasions of entrenching upon their profession.' Physicians would consult him freely. As a chemist and experimental pharmacologist, he prepared various remedies. Some of these he tried out on patients himself, others he gave to practitioners who might use them. Boyle seems to have abundantly provided what we today call 'curbstone consultations.' In no way bound by guild rules and conventions or by rigid educational standards, Boyle was free to learn from whatever sources appealed to him. Repeatedly he emphasized the importance of learning from experience, both his own and that of others, and by 'others' he included not only physicians and learned gentlemen, but even the meanest of society, provided they had experience in treating disease. This experience need not be restricted to treatment of humans but should include animals as well. Thus, in speaking of even the 'skilfullest physicians,' he indicated that many of them 'might, without disparagement to their profession, do it an useful piece of service, if they would be pleased to collect and digest all the approved experiments and practices of the farriers, graziers, butchers, and the like, which the ancients did not despise.; and. which might serve to illustrate the methodus medendi.' He was quite critical of physicians who were too conservative even to examine the claims of the nonprofessionals, especially those who were relatively low in the social or intellectual scale. This casts an interesting sidelight on the snobbishness of the medical profession.""","""Robert Boyle's Medical Influence and Practice""","2013","""Robert Boyle, known primarily for his groundbreaking contributions to natural philosophy and chemistry, also played a significant role in the development of medicine during the 17th century. Despite not being a trained physician himself, Boyle's influence on medical practices and theories of his time was considerable. His multi-faceted approach to understanding the natural world not only advanced the fields of physics and chemistry but also had a lasting impact on the practice of medicine.  Boyle's interest in medicine stemmed from his broader curiosity about the workings of the natural world. He believed that a deep understanding of the fundamental principles of nature could revolutionize medical treatments and interventions. Although he did not practice medicine professionally, Boyle engaged with medical practitioners of his time, exchanging ideas and conducting experiments that would pave the way for future advancements in the field.  One of Boyle's most significant contributions to medicine was his emphasis on the importance of experimentation and empirical evidence. He was a fervent advocate for the use of scientific methods in medical research, urging physicians to move away from traditional beliefs based on ancient texts and superstitions. Boyle's insistence on observation and experimentation laid the foundation for the emerging field of experimental medicine, where treatments were validated through rigorous testing and analysis.  Boyle's influence on medical practice extended to his work in pharmacology and therapeutics. He conducted experiments to test the efficacy of various substances in treating ailments, laying the groundwork for modern drug testing protocols. Boyle's approach to pharmacology emphasized the need for systematic testing and documentation, marking a departure from the reliance on anecdotal evidence prevalent at the time.  In addition to his experimental work, Boyle also contributed significantly to the understanding of human anatomy and physiology. His studies on the properties of air and the role of respiration in sustaining life had implications for respiratory medicine and laid the groundwork for future research in pulmonary physiology. Boyle's investigations into the nature of blood and its circulation furthered knowledge in the emerging field of hematology.  Beyond his specific contributions to medical science, Boyle's holistic approach to understanding the natural world had broader implications for the practice of medicine. His emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of diverse fields of knowledge encouraged a more comprehensive understanding of health and disease. Boyle believed that progress in medicine required insights from multiple disciplines, including chemistry, physics, and biology.  Boyle's influence on medical education was also significant. His efforts to promote a more systematic and evidence-based approach to medical practice resonated with educators and practitioners seeking to modernize medical training. Boyle's writings, which emphasized the importance of critical thinking and empirical observation, shaped the curriculum of medical schools and influenced generations of physicians.  While Boyle's impact on medicine may not be as widely recognized as his contributions to other scientific disciplines, his legacy endures in the principles and practices that underpin modern medical science. His advocacy for empirical evidence, experimental rigor, and interdisciplinary collaboration continues to shape the way we approach health care and medical research today. Robert Boyle's work exemplifies the enduring influence of a curious mind and a relentless pursuit of knowledge in advancing our understanding of the human body and the practice of medicine.""","614"
"Platt Dwight R  1931 ","""Miscellaneous insect remains constituted two-tenths of one per cent of the yearly diet. Hemipteran remains were present only in trace that small bones of mammals may be completely ground up and digested by the crow. Hence the amount of food furnished by mammals, either alive or as carrion, may be higher than my figures indicate. Bones of birds were found in only one pellet, obtained in early July. However, few pellets were collected in the nesting season. The eggshell occurring in the pellets probably was indicative of extensive feeding on dumping grounds, and I received no reports of eggs lost to crows on poultry farms. Such damage has been reduced to a minimum since most poultry flocks are well-housed. The percentage of aquatic the diet increased during the early autumn, as the creeks dried up in eastern Harvey County, but after mid-October declined rapidly, as all the pools were then gone. Conclusions The large wintering flocks of crows are important consumers of grain sorghums in south-central Kansas. In the early autumn when the crow population is building up, it damages the sorghum crop before harvest. The damage varies from year to year, being much more keenly felt in dry years when the crop is poor or in years when the crop is late. However, most of the sorghums, which are the principal item of diet of these wintering crows, are waste grain taken from the fields after harvest. Some of this waste grain taken should be counted as a loss because the farmer would normally let his livestock utilize it. Crows use newly sown oat fields as a major source of food during the late winter and early spring. However, damage to the crop is slight. Corn is not an important crop in this area. The crow population is low at the season when corn is planted, so probably little damage is done at this time. Much of the corn eaten in winter is waste grain. Feeding on wheat is of little economic importance, since most of that taken is waste grain. Feeding on sunflower seeds may be counted as neutral to slightly beneficial. Damage to watermelons, which are extensively grown in the sandhills region, may be important at times. Crow feeding upon other crops is only locally significant. Although it has food preferences, the crow is euryphagous, and its diet is governed to a large extent by the availability of various types of food in its habitat. Therefore, in its ecologic relationships with many other species, it is a density dependent predator. It reduces the numbers of a certain species when the latter becomes unusually abundant but lessens the mortality pressure against it when the prey population is low. Predators of this type tend to maintain stability in a community in contrast to the violent oscillations often caused by a more stenophagous predator. This study indicates that in south-central Kansas crows help to stabilize the populations of grasshoppers, ground-dwelling beetles both predaceous and non-predaceous, and probably those of other types of insects whose soil dwelling larvae are subject to predation during summer plowing. Crows also serve as scavengers, feeding on carrion and at dumping grounds, as indicated by the high frequency of eggshell and mammalian bone in the diet. Bird bones were found in an insignificant amount in this study, but extensive collections were not made during the main nesting season. Summary An intensive study of the yearly diet of crows was carried on from December, 95/82, to February, 95/84, in Harvey County and the northeastern townships of Reno County, Kansas, in order to discover some of the ecologic and economic relationships of the population of crows in south-central Kansas. The study is based upon the analysis of 17 regurgitated pellets collected throughout the year. Data obtained from this analysis have been correlated with field observations on crows and habitat changes. The area is in the zone of transition between tall-grass and short-grass prairie, and the predominant agricultural crop is wheat. The study area supports a breeding population of approximately one pair of crows per square mile, but large flocks of wintering crows move into the western part of the area near the Arkansas River Valley. Plant material amounted to 9. per cent of the pellet residues. Wheat is the food taken in greatest amount in the yearly average, but the staple foods of the wintering crows are grain sorghum, sunflower seeds, and corn. Crows use newly sown oat fields as a major source of food in late winter and early spring, but damage to the crop seems to be slight. Growers of grain sorghum and, locally, growers of corn and watermelons, sustain serious damage from crows. Being euryphagous, crows exert a stabilizing influence on many kinds of prey and on the biotic community as a whole. This study indicates that their effects are especially important in helping to stabilize the populations of grasshoppers and of ground-dwelling beetles, and possibly those of some other insects that have soil-dwelling larvae. Carrion and material from dumping grounds furnish another fairly constant component of the crow's diet.""","""Crow diet and ecological impact""","1058","""Crows are fascinating birds that play a significant role in maintaining ecological balance. Understanding their diet and ecological impact sheds light on their importance in ecosystems. Crows are highly intelligent omnivores known to consume a wide variety of foods, ranging from insects and invertebrates to fruits, seeds, carrion, and even human food waste. This diverse diet allows crows to adapt to various environments, making them one of the most widespread bird species worldwide.  Insects form a crucial part of a crow's diet, especially during the breeding season when protein-rich food is essential for the development of young chicks. Crows are adept at catching insects in flight or foraging on the ground for beetles, caterpillars, grasshoppers, and other small invertebrates. By controlling insect populations, crows help in maintaining the balance of ecosystems and reducing agricultural pests, benefiting farmers and the environment.  Apart from insects, crows also feed on a variety of fruits and seeds. They are known to raid orchards and farmlands, sometimes causing conflicts with humans. However, their role in seed dispersal cannot be overlooked. By consuming fruits and seeds and later dispersing them through their droppings, crows contribute to plant regeneration and forest diversity. This mutualistic relationship between crows and plants highlights their ecological importance in forest regeneration and maintenance.  Carrion, or dead animal remains, is another significant component of a crow's diet. Crows act as scavengers, cleaning up carcasses and preventing the spread of diseases. Their scavenging behavior not only aids in nutrient recycling but also helps in maintaining a clean environment by reducing the presence of decaying organic matter. In this way, crows play a crucial role in the decomposition process, which is vital for ecosystem health.  Additionally, crows are opportunistic feeders and are known to exploit human food sources. They scavenge from garbage bins, landfills, and other human settlements, leading to conflicts with humans. While this behavior can be perceived as a nuisance, it also reflects crows' adaptability to changing environments. However, reliance on human food sources can have negative consequences, such as exposure to contaminants and reduced foraging on natural food items, which may impact their health in the long run.  Despite the benefits crows provide in controlling pest populations and aiding in nutrient cycling, their ecological impact is not without challenges. Crows are known to impact other bird species by preying on their eggs and nestlings, especially during the breeding season. This predatory behavior can have significant implications for the breeding success of smaller bird species, disrupting local bird populations and ecosystem dynamics.  Furthermore, competition for resources among crows and other bird species can lead to conflicts within ecosystems. Crows' aggressive behavior towards other birds, combined with their intelligence and adaptability, can give them a competitive edge in securing food resources. This competitive advantage can sometimes negatively affect other bird species, altering the natural balance within the ecosystem.  Human activities, such as urbanization and habitat destruction, also influence crow populations and their ecological interactions. As natural habitats are being replaced by urban areas, crows are adapting to urban environments, where they find abundant food sources and nesting opportunities. While this adaptability showcases crows' resilience, it also raises concerns about their impact on urban ecosystems and native bird species.  To mitigate the potential negative ecological impacts of crows, it is essential to maintain habitat diversity and minimize sources of anthropogenic food subsidies that attract crows to urban areas. Promoting responsible waste management practices, protecting natural habitats, and implementing strategies to support biodiversity can help create a more balanced ecosystem where crows and other bird species can coexist harmoniously.  In conclusion, crows are versatile birds with a diverse diet that plays a crucial role in ecosystem functioning. While their scavenging behavior helps in nutrient recycling and pest control, their predatory nature and competitive interactions pose challenges for other bird species. Understanding the complexities of crow diet and their ecological impact is essential for promoting sustainable coexistence between crows, humans, and other wildlife in shared habitats.""","817"
"Cunningham Francis A  Francis Aloysius ","""Art.. The ecclesiastical salaries shall be re-established whenever the bishop, or the diocesan administrator shall pledge himself in writing to observe the laws of the State. Art.. In the dioceses of Posen-Gnesen and Paderborn the ecclesiastical salaries shall be re-established as soon as a new bishop shall be appointed in concert with the Government. Art.. If in any diocese, in which the ecclesiastical salaries shall have been re-established, any priest refuses obedience to the laws of the State despite the pledges given by his bishop, the Government is authorized to suppress anew any allowance in favor of such recalcitrants. Art.. The Government is authorized to re-establish the salaries of priests who by their acts manifest the intention of obeying the laws of the State. If after that they shall violate the law, the suppression of their salaries shall be enforced. This was the law, variously called the Brodkorbgesetz, the Sperrgesetz and the like, which was passed on April 2, 875/8, with the hope thereby of starving the priesthood of Germany into submission. On May 3, 875/8, the minister Falk brought forth another law placing under the power of the State all sales and alienations of ecclesiastical properties and of pious foundations. A law of June 0 gave to the State the temporal administration of Catholic parishes; it was a law very much like that of the present French regime which would impose associations cultuelles upon the French churches. On July came a still more iniquitous ordinance, regulating 'the rights of the Old Catholics to the property of the churches.' Thereby these sectaries were authorized to claim a part of the usufruct of parochial properties, and to employ in their services the use of Catholic churches and vestments. If a pastor or curate should apostatize to this sect he might claim possession of the rectory and church, which at his death would pass into the hands of the Old Catholics, should they be in the majority. In fact, in some places, such as Bochum and Wiesbaden, the Catholics were expelled from their Church by a very small minority of the sectaries. On February 8, 876, the priest was deprived of the right of directing Catholic instruction in the primary schools. On June, of the same year, the State claimed formally the right of surveillance over the administration of the property of the Catholic Church. There was little more that the State could now do to subjugate Catholic faith short of absolute murder. The Kulturkampf had reached its most critical stage. It was, indeed, a moment when the human pride of the persecutors impelled them to boast of their crimes, and promise, if it were possible, greater exactitude in the future. The Chancellor could declare, in 877, that the Kulturkampf was then at its zenith. In consequence it was time to look for that civilization which Virchow had prophesied as its ultimate result. Its real fruits were not what Bismarck or his Protestant clientele would have wished. A new order had arisen in Germany, an order of unrest and anarchy which manifested its existence in a manner not at all to the liking of the ruling powers. Thus, on May 1, 878, the Socialist Hoedel attempted the life of the Emperor, and the crime was repeated by Nobiling a few weeks after, on June. Even Protestantism felt the destructive force of the blow aimed at Catholicity. There were hardly any more marriages performed by Protestant ministers; their temples were deserted; their pastors openly attacked the divinity of Christ, while everywhere like a shadow of death a reign of crime and immorality rested upon the population. TURN OF THE TIDE. The country at length began to awaken to a sense of the criminality of those laws which it had imposed upon an inoffensive people. Even the Gazette of the Cross, the organ of the orthodox conservatives, could say: 'It is through the Kulturkampf that we have encountered our moral and material miseries, miseries that are evident in every part of the German Empire. It is only by renouncing the Kulturkampf, and the ideas which brought it forth, that we can hope to escape from our embarrassments. Such is our opinion, and it is becoming more general every day. Where there is a will there is a way.' The Gazette but echoed the sentiments of nearly all the German Protestants who had retained anything of Christian faith, and in consequence a demand was sounded throughout the Empire for a cessation of the persecution. Bismarck, himself, though still wedded to his hope of dominating the spiritual life of the Church, saw clearly that his methods had proven abortive. Hence, from 878 onward, the trend of governmental action proceeded slowly but surely towards a reconciliation with the Catholic elements in the nation. Moreover, it was becoming more and more evident that the Government needed the co-operation of the Catholics in curbing the spirit of revolution now making itself heard above the clamor of intrigue and oppression. It was not surprising, therefore, that Prince Bismarck should turn to the Holy See for succor in his difficulty. Mgr. Masella, the papal nuncio at Munich, afterwards Cardinal, was therefore invited to Berlin to confer upon matters touching the relations of Church and State. Such a visit, however, was entirely out of the question as long as the laws against Catholics continued in vigor. The Chancellor contrived nevertheless to arrange a meeting at the baths of Kissingen, but without arriving at any satisfactory agreement. The Prince then sent his representative, Count Hubner, to Vienna to confer with the papal nuncio at that Court, Mgr. Jacobini. Again negotiations were opened at Gastein in the duchy of Salzburg, but like the others came to naught, as the papal representative refused conciliation as long as the May Laws should continue. It now became quite evident that the plans of Bismarck must require a reversal of his former policy. Accordingly, in 880, a beginning was made by a slight modification of the obnoxious laws. The Government thereby yielded its claim to the right of deposing ecclesiastics; in 881, it recognized the vicars-general who had been appointed through ecclesiastical channels to administer the dioceses of Paderborn, Osnabruck and Breslau; nor were these prelates required to take the oath of blind obedience to obnoxious laws. The bishoprics of Fulda and of Treves had been filled by papal appointment, the former receiving as its incumbent, Mgr. Kopp, and the latter, Mgr. Korum; strange to say, the Chancellor recognized both prelates. These victories of the Catholics, slight in themselves, were powerful as evidencing the direction of governmental policies. The reversion, however, of Bismarck, was not so quickly followed by the creatures whom he had placed in the Chambers, and whose hostility to Catholic interests continued as violent and bitter as ever. 'Let us be patient for one or two years,' cried Bennigsen, the leader of the Liberals, 'and we shall see the fruits of our glorious policy; we shall have conquered the Pope.' In two years, 882, the Pope remained unconquered, while in Germany the Catholic party increased in numbers and in power. On May 1, 883, new concessions were made to the Catholics. Provision was made for the pardoning of deposed bishops, the legal formalities required by candidates for ecclesiastical offices could be dispensed with at the option of the Minister of Worship, the State examinations of ecclesiastical students were set aside. Still the May Laws remained upon the statute books, and against them the Centre party, under the leadership of Windthorst, continued to protest even though advised to show some leniency by Mgr. Galimberti. The firmness of the great leader was rewarded. The affair of the Caroline Islands, disputed between Germany and Spain, gave Bismarck an opportunity of approaching the Holy See with better grace than before. Accordingly the Chancellor arranged that the Holy Father, Leo XIII., should be invited to arbitrate between the contending nations. The Sovereign Pontiff could not help being happily impressed by this diplomatic action on the part of the two powers, which thereby recognized the Holy Father as a temporal sovereign despite the Piedmontese occupation of Rome. The successful result of the papal arbitration opened up new avenues whereby reconciliation might be effected in Germany. The Sees of Cologne and Fribourg were at once filled, and Mgr. Kopp, Bishop of Fulda, was offered a seat in the Upper House of Prussia. In return for the many evidences of good feeling thus betrayed by the Government, Cardinal Ledochowski, who knew himself to be a persona non grata to the Prussian State, resigned his diocese of Posen, which was immediately filled by a new incumbent, Mgr. Dinder. On May 1, 886, the theological schools were re-established as they had been before the beginning of the Kulturkampf. The High Court instituted for the adjudging of ecclesiastical affairs was suppressed, and the Sovereign Pontiff was hitherto to be recognized as the superior judge in such matters. The elections of February, 887, increased the numbers of the Centre party, and Bismarck, thereupon, deemed the time fitting to end once for all the supreme trial of the Kulturkampf. Certain modifications of the May Laws were placed in the hands of the Centre; some were accepted, others rejected. The concessions, however, were of such a nature that they might be in a way accepted, inasmuch as they gave promise of other and larger benefits. Through that diplomatic farsightedness which ever distinguished the great Pope Leo XIII., affairs were gradually assuming a condition satisfactory to the Catholics of Germany, although Windthorst and the Centre Party still claimed many concessions due in ordinary justice.""","""Kulturkampf and Church-State Relations""","2088","""Kulturkampf was a period of intense conflict between the German state and the Catholic Church in the late 19th century. This ideological struggle aimed to assert state control over religious matters and reduce the influence of the Catholic Church within German society. The term """"Kulturkampf"""" translates to """"culture struggle"""" or """"struggle for civilization,"""" reflecting the underlying goal of modernization and secularization promoted by the state. The roots of this conflict can be traced back to the unification of Germany under Otto von Bismarck in 1871, leading to tensions between the conservative forces of the Catholic Church and the emerging power of the unified German state.  One of the key factors that fueled the Kulturkampf was the perceived threat posed by the Catholic Church to the newly established German Empire. Bismarck and his supporters viewed the Church as a barrier to national unity and modernization, particularly due to its allegiance to Rome and its supposed obstruction of state authority. The Catholic Church, on the other hand, saw itself as a guardian of moral values, social cohesion, and the rights of Catholics in the face of increasing state intervention in religious affairs.  The Kulturkampf era saw a series of laws and policies aimed at curtailing the influence of the Catholic Church in German society. Bismarck introduced the Anti-Jesuit Law in 1872, which banned the Jesuit order and expelled its members from Germany. This was followed by the May Laws in 1873, which placed restrictions on the Catholic Church's influence over education and marriage, requiring clergy to obtain state approval before performing marriages. These laws aimed to weaken the Church's control over key social institutions and to bring them under state supervision.  Simultaneously, the state sought to assert dominance over religious matters through the appointment of state-controlled bishops and the regulation of clergy training. The state-sponsored """"Kulturkampf bishops"""" were viewed as a direct challenge to the authority of the Pope and the Catholic hierarchy, further exacerbating tensions between the Church and the state. The attempt to bring the Catholic Church under state control reflected a broader trend of secularization and state centralization in European politics during the 19th century.  The Kulturkampf was not limited to legal and administrative measures; it also had a profound social and cultural impact on German society. The conflict polarized public opinion, with supporters of the state's policies viewing the Catholic Church as a reactionary force resisting progress and national unity. On the other hand, Catholics saw themselves as victims of state repression and defenders of religious freedom and autonomy. The Kulturkampf highlighted deep divisions within German society along religious lines and contributed to heightened social tensions and political instability.  Despite the state's efforts to suppress the influence of the Catholic Church, the Kulturkampf ultimately failed to achieve its objectives. The Catholic Church, backed by strong public support and international solidarity, successfully resisted state intervention and preserved its institutional autonomy. Public opinion turned against Bismarck's aggressive policies, leading to a gradual relaxation of anti-Catholic measures and a shift towards more conciliatory approaches to Church-state relations.  The end of the Kulturkampf marked a turning point in Church-state relations in Germany, paving the way for a more cooperative and pluralistic approach to religious diversity. The legacy of this conflict continues to shape debates over the separation of church and state, religious freedom, and the role of religion in public life in modern Germany and beyond. The Kulturkampf serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of state overreach in matters of religion and the importance of respecting religious pluralism and autonomy in a diverse society.  In conclusion, the Kulturkampf was a turbulent chapter in German history that exemplified the complexities of Church-state relations in a changing political landscape. The conflict between the German state and the Catholic Church reflected broader tensions between tradition and modernity, religious authority and state power, and cultural identity and national unity. While the Kulturkampf failed to achieve its goals of subordinating the Catholic Church to state control, it left a lasting impact on German society and raised important questions about the limits of state authority in religious matters. This historical episode serves as a reminder of the enduring challenge of balancing competing interests and values in the realm of Church-state relations.""","875"
"Murrey Thomas J  Thomas Jefferson ",""". =Toast= is very palatable and digestible when properly prepared. Many seem to think that they have made toast when they brown the outside of a slice of bread. Have they? The object in making toast is to evaporate all moisture from the bread, and holding a slice over the fire to singe does not accomplish this; it only warms the moisture, making the inside of the bread doughy and decidedly indigestible. The true way of preparing it is to cut the bread into slices a quarter of an inch thick, trim off all crust, put the slices in a pan or plate, place them in the oven--which must not be too hot--take them out when a delicate brown, and butter at once. For my own use I dry all home-made bread in this manner. =Dry Toast= should be served within the folds of a napkin if you wish to keep it hot; toast-racks allow the heat to escape, and they are not recommended. =Dip Toast.=--Prepare the toast as above directed; dip the edges into hot water quickly, and butter at once. This is also called water toast. =Milk Toast.=--Wet the pan to be used with cold water, which prevents burning. Melt an ounce of floured butter; whisk into it a pint of hot milk; add a little salt; simmer. Prepare four slices of toast; put them in a deep dish one at a time; pour a little of the milk over each, and over the last one pour the remainder of the milk. =Anchovy Toast.=--The best way to prepare this appetizing dish is as follows: Toast the bread and trim it neatly, and place it near the range to keep warm; next prepare a 'dip,' as for ordinary cream toast; spread a thin layer of anchovy paste on each slice of bread; place in a hot, deep dish; pour the prepared cream over them, and serve. =Clam Toast.=--Chop up two dozen small clams into fine pieces; simmer for thirty minutes in hot water enough to cover them. Beat up the yolks of two eggs; add a little cayenne and a gill of warmed milk; dissolve half a teaspoonful of flour in a little cold milk; simmer all together; pour over buttered toast, and serve. =Marrow-bone Toast.=--Procure two beef shin-bones about six to eight inches long; cover them with dough, and wrap them in muslin; pour hot water enough to cover them, and boil for an hour and a half. Remove cloth and dough; shake or draw out the marrow with a long-handled fork upon slices of hot toast. Add salt, cayenne, and, if convenient, a little chopped celery, and serve. =Oyster Toast.=--Select fifteen plump oysters; chop them fine, and add salt, pepper, and a suspicion of nutmeg. Beat up the yolks of two eggs with a gill of cream; whisk this into the simmering oysters. When set, pour the whole over slices of buttered toast. =Salmon Toast.=--It very often occurs that a can of salmon is not all used at a meal, and yet there is not quite enough for another meal without other dishes or ingredients added to it. Should this occur, mince the salmon, heat, and season it and serve it on toast. A poached egg added to it is quite acceptable. =Tongue Toast.=--A very nice dish is prepared from cold boiled or potted tongue. Slice the tongue, and cut each slice into small, fine pieces; heat it in a pan with a little butter. To prevent burning, moisten with warm water or clear soup; add salt and pepper; stir into it two beaten eggs. When set, arrange neatly on toast. Dainty bits of roast game, fowl, etc., minced, warmed over, and served on toast are excellent, and show a way of using good material that would otherwise be wasted. EGGS AND. =To Test Eggs.=--Dissolve an ounce of salt in ten ounces of water; add the eggs. Good ones will sink, indifferent eggs will swim, and bad eggs will float, even in pure water. Fresh eggs are more transparent in the centre. Old eggs are transparent at the top. Eggs may be kept a long time by covering them with beeswax dissolved in warm olive or cotton-seed oil. Use one third wax to two thirds oil. =Baked Eggs.=--Mince half a pound of lean boiled ham, add an equal quantity of cracker crumbs.""","""Toast preparation and variations.""","952","""Toast, a beloved breakfast staple that has stood the test of time, is not only quick and easy to make but also highly versatile in terms of both preparation and toppings.

But the labor organizations do not permit the public interests or those of the corporation to interfere with what they consider to be the just and inalienable rights of each and every employee. Applied to the railroad business, the fixed principle that every man shall take his turn is fundamentally wrong and demoralizing. It is one of the wedges that are being used to destroy personal supervision and management and to substitute management by machine methods. In my opinion its tendency is in the interests of poor service. Healthy competition in good behavior is almost obliterated, while honest ambition and esprit de corps get very little encouragement. It has the general effect of removing the attention of employees from the management and concentrating it steadfastly upon the organization, that is to say, upon the source from which increase of pay and all other blessings are expected to flow. Of course, I cannot expect railroad managers to agree at all points with my estimate of their powers and functions, or of the helpless situation in which they now find themselves. Just at present, however, I am not interested in opinions from any quarter. The facts that interest me, and I think the public as well, relate to what these railroad managers have done in the past and are actually doing at the present day, with such powers as they possess, in the interest of safe and efficient railroad service. It may be very interesting to be informed that a superintendent has the power promptly to discharge an engineman for running a danger signal and placing the lives of five hundred passengers in utmost peril, but it is much more to the point to impress upon the public mind that the action of the official will not amount to a snap of his finger if an organization puts down its foot and signifies its opinion to the contrary. Illustrations of these facts are not far to seek. Only a short time ago an engineman was promptly discharged for disregarding a signal in a most inexcusable manner. The case was passed up higher for the approval of the general manager. Meanwhile the man had discovered some kind of an excuse for his action, and a committee was appointed to look into the matter. There being a total difference of opinion between the management and the grievance committee, the heads of different organizations were summoned from some western city to help straighten out the deadlock. After a while the man was put back on his engine, and the report passed round that the case had been settled in this way in the interests of harmony. No wonder the superintendent who was concerned in the matter threw up his hands in disgust and exclaimed, Whats the use? This method of interfering with the regular course of discipline may perhaps be proper and commendable in a cigar factory or a cotton mill, but on a railroad, where the lives of countless people are dependent upon obedience to the rules, its effect upon the service is absolutely fatal. But unhappily this is not the whole story, for it must be confessed that the public frequently joins hands with the organizations in defeating the ends and aims of discipline. After some of the worst and most inexcusable accidents that have ever occurred on New England railroads, petition has followed petition into the railroad offices with the expressed object of influencing the management to reinstate men in the service who have been convicted of inefficiency or unpardonable carelessness. Of course a superintendent should thoroughly investigate every case on its merits, but the verdict of the management should be final. The wisdom of this policy might be questioned if superintendents were political appointees or owed their positions to graft or pull. As a matter of fact these men are among the hardest worked, most thoroughly capable and conscientious men in the United States. No combination of opinion from the public, the railroad commissioners, and the labor organizations is half as likely to be just and impartial as the individual judgment of the superintendent on the spot. The following significant remark by one of those gentlemen may well be taken to heart by the public as well as by employees: With a free hand, we could put a stop to this killing in a week. The story of railroad management is now before us, and the record of accidents all over the United States is the price that is being paid for it. As I have described the situation, the circle of cause and effect is now complete. Beginning with the negligence of employees, which must be considered as the primary cause of these accidents, I next took up the matter of discipline, whose function it is to control and put a stop to this negligence. The system was found to be altogether inadequate and useless. Finally, I attempted to demonstrate that the labor organizations are responsible for the nature of this discipline, and thus indirectly for the accidents that have resulted from its inefficiency. Systems of discipline vary on different roads; nevertheless these contentions are sound and universally applicable, for the blight of interference with the management has in greater or less degree withered every system of railroad discipline in the United States, and exposed the traveling public to the mercy of service that is inefficient and demoralized. For the rest, it will be evident that the foregoing diagnosis of the situation bears on its face unmistakable indications of the nature of the cure. At all cost, interference with discipline must cease. This conclusion admits no compromise. At the present day every decision made by a superintendent is practically subject to the approval of the Grievance Committee. But this is not all: the railroad manager is handicapped and held up at every turn. In his dealings with the labor problem, if by any possibility he manages to escape the fire, it can only be by taking refuge in the frying-pan. An illustration in point is the problem of keeping expenses within reasonable limits and at the same time administering discipline to the very men who, backed by powerful organizations, are continually insisting upon additions to the pay-rolls. But now, granting the situation and the difficulties as I have described them, in what direction are we to look for relief? As it seems to me, an unmistakable expression of public opinion would, in the first place, go far in starting us all thinking and working in the right direction. But even this will have little effect until railroad men wake up out of the self-satisfied trance in which at present they seem to be comfortably slumbering. Time was when our forgetfulness of the public interests could be accounted for by our own poverty and sufferings. But these unhappy conditions no longer exist, for to-day we are probably as well paid and otherwise as well provided for and equipped as any class of workers in the United States. Nevertheless, when we are informed that in the year 906 ten thousand people were killed and one hundred thousand injured on American railroads, the knowledge does not seem to give us pause in any way, or to ruffle our individual self-satisfaction; while our organizations look at their surroundings silently and impassively as the pyramids and obelisks look upon the Egyptian deserts. But affairs have now come to such a pass on the roads that at last we are imperatively called upon to answer questions and explain our position. Our best friends are beginning to criticise us. They remind us that interference with discipline is in reality an attempt to take part in its administration, and that our unions were never intended or organized for that purpose. For a great many years an educational campaign has been in progress all over the country for the purpose of reminding us of our duties and obligations to our unions. This educational method has been extremely successful, and has brought into being armies of laboring men thoroughly loyal and self-centred. But the result of this system on the railroads has been so disastrous to human life that at last we are beginning to realize that there is a limit even to the pursuit of our individual well-being. In paying attention, even at this late date, to the higher call of the social conscience, we railroad men shall enter a new world with brighter prospects and a wider horizon. The nobility of labor has always been the proud watchword of American civilization. Let us be watchful lest we forfeit our claim to share in this national distinction. By recognizing our duties and responsibilities to society in our treatment of these railroad problems, we shall finally take our place in line with those who through sacrifice and high endeavor are destined, in good time, to cut out their way to industrial freedom. IV The relations, cooperative and otherwise, that exist between the men and the management of a railroad are intimately connected with the safety and efficiency of the service. Generally speaking, the public is quite ignorant of the nature of these relations. The men and the management may be working harmoniously with a constant solicitude for the safety and well-being of the patrons of the road; or, on the other hand, they may be intrenched in opposing camps, mutually watchful and suspicious of each other, and more or less forgetful of the wider and vastly more important interests of the community at large. One way or the other, the public knows little or nothing about the actual situation.""","""Railroad management and labor relations""","1886","""Railroad management and labor relations have historically been at the forefront of industrial conflicts, shaping the development of labor rights, safety regulations, and the overall functioning of the transportation industry. The management of railroads involves the coordination of various elements such as infrastructure maintenance, scheduling, financial operations, and regulatory compliance to ensure efficient and safe rail transportation services. On the other hand, labor relations encompass the interactions between railroad workers, their unions, and management, focusing on issues like wages, working conditions, and collective bargaining agreements.  Railroad management plays a crucial role in overseeing the day-to-day operations of railroads, which involves a diverse range of responsibilities to ensure the efficiency and safety of transportation services. Effective management requires strategic planning to optimize routes and schedules, maintain infrastructure, manage budgets, and comply with safety regulations and industry standards. Additionally, managers need to oversee personnel, including engineers, conductors, maintenance workers, and administrative staff, to ensure a well-coordinated workforce.  One of the key challenges in railroad management is the need for ongoing infrastructure maintenance and modernization. Railroads require continuous upkeep of tracks, signals, bridges, and equipment to ensure safe and reliable operations. This necessitates strategic asset management to prioritize investments in infrastructure upgrades, technology integration, and equipment maintenance to enhance operational efficiency and safety standards. Moreover, compliance with federal and state regulations, such as those set by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), is essential to ensure the safety and security of railroad operations.  Labor relations in the railroad industry have a long history of contentious interactions between workers and management. Railroad workers have formed unions to collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, working conditions, and job security. The Railway Labor Act of 1926 was a significant milestone in the United States, as it established the framework for collective bargaining and peaceful resolution of labor disputes in the railroad industry. This legislation aimed to prevent strikes and promote stable labor relations through mediation and arbitration.  However, despite the regulatory framework, conflicts between railroad management and labor unions have persisted over issues such as wages, working hours, healthcare benefits, and job protections. Strikes, work stoppages, and labor disputes have been common in the history of the railroad industry, impacting service reliability, customer satisfaction, and overall industry stability. Resolving labor disputes requires effective communication, negotiation skills, and a shared commitment to finding mutually beneficial solutions that balance the interests of workers and management.  In recent years, advancements in technology, such as automation, data analytics, and digital systems, have transformed railroad management practices. These innovations have improved operational efficiency, safety standards, and maintenance procedures, creating new opportunities for cost savings and service enhancements. However, technological advancements have also raised concerns among labor unions about job security, training requirements, and the impact of automation on the workforce.  To navigate the complex landscape of railroad management and labor relations, collaboration, communication, and mutual respect between management and labor are essential. Effective management practices that prioritize safety, efficiency, and regulatory compliance can contribute to a more sustainable and resilient railroad industry. Likewise, constructive labor relations that uphold the rights and well-being of workers while promoting the long-term viability of railroad operations are vital for fostering a harmonious and productive work environment. By addressing the challenges and opportunities in railroad management and labor relations, the industry can continue to evolve and adapt to meet the demands of the modern transportation landscape.""","668"
"Piccoli Raffaello","""They duplicate history and science with a series of concepts, which, unless they are the same which constitute history and science (in which case we have history and we have science, and not a philosophy of history or of nature), are necessarily empty of any concrete determinations. But though Croce points to philosophy of history and philosophy of nature as to the two typical instances of philosophism, yet he is ready to acknowledge that a good deal of thought that has gone under those names in the past has had a large influence in moulding many of our historical and philosophical conceptions, and, in the case of the second one, in helping us to realize the unity and spirituality of nature, and to recognize in the history of nature the same principles operating in the history of man. Croce's idealism, in fact, does not divide nature from the spirit except in the logical sense which has been made clear in the preceding chapter; it does not relegate nature in an unknowable sphere beyond the reach of human minds. It unifies spirit and nature, but a parte subjecti, and not a parte objecti, and reduces nature to the spirit, rather than the spirit to nature; which is the only process that makes such a unification intelligible and significant. The last of the five fundamental forms of philosophic error consists in the arbitrary separation of the subject from its predicate, of history from philosophy, and in the consequent position of the subject as predicate, that is, of a mere representation as a concept. This may sound rather abstruse, but can immediately be made clear by adding that what Croce has in mind in this definition is the production of myths. This error he therefore calls either historicism (from the logical process by which it is produced), or mythologism (from the form which it commonly assumes). A myth is to him not a mere poetic or sthetic imagination, but necessarily includes an affirmation or logical judgment. It differs also from allegory, in which the relation established between a poetic fiction and a concept is always more or less openly declared to be arbitrary, and the two terms are not confused with each other. In a myth, on the contrary, the poetic fiction assumes the actual function of the concept, transforming both philosophy and history into a fable or legend. Errors of this class are frequent in every system of philosophy, when the thinker, either consciously and deliberately, as in the case of Plato, or unwittingly, as in Kant's Ding an sich or in Schopenhauer's Will, fills the gaps of his real speculation with a mere image. But mythologism is more generally the form of religious error, since there is no religion without a logical affirmation embodied in a myth. If myth and religion coincide, as the distinction between myth and philosophy is that of error and truth, of a false and a true philosophy, we must conclude that religion as truth is one with philosophy, or, as Croce expresses it, that the true religion is philosophy; and this appears to Croce to be the conclusion of all ancient and modern thought in regard to the history of religions. Philosophies have sprung up in all times from the soil of religious thought, and more or less completely resolved in themselves, and logically clarified, the obscure substance of myth. This is Croce's clear-cut, unequivocal solution of the problem of the relations between philosophy and religion: there is no place reserved anywhere in his system for an either internal or external revelation other than that perpetual revelation of truth, which is at the same time history and philosophy. From the possible combinations of these five fundamental forms of error, three more complex ones are derived: dualism, when two contradictory methods, one logically legitimate and the other illegitimate, or both equally false, are brought together, and considered to be both philosophically valid; scepticism, when the mind, in the presence of confusion and error, asserts the mystery of reality, which is the problem itself, but denies its own power to deal with it; and finally, mysticism, when even that last semblance of thought, by which the sceptic affirms that there is a mystery, is abandoned, and the immediate actuality of life is regarded to be the only truth. Dualism leads inevitably to the conception of a double reality, and we have already seen how the whole of Croce's speculation continually tends towards the logical unification of dualities, as with spirit and nature, value and fact. Every philosophical problem seems to present itself to his mind as involved in a dualistic difficulty; every solution becomes satisfactory to him only when the last shreds of dualism are eliminated from it. While scepticism is a logical error (the affirmation of a purely negative position), it contains within itself one of the essential moments of every progress in thought, the scepsis, or philosophical doubt, which is the negation of an error, and therefore the germ of every true affirmation. As for mysticism, we have dealt with it elsewhere as being one of the untenable aspects of logical scepticism; we may add that, if it ever obeyed the laws of internal coherence, we should not even be able to discuss it, since its only conceivable expression would be an ecstatic silence. The same character of necessity that invests these forms of the logical error is present also in the false solutions of other philosophical problems, and we need only refer the reader to our discussion of sthetic theories. In both cases, not only the number, but also the logical succession, of the necessary forms of error, depends on the number of possible arbitrary combinations of the spiritual forms, or concepts of reality. But infinite, on the other hand, are the individual forms of error, as infinite are the individual forms of truth: the problems are always historically conditioned and variable, and so are also the solutions and the false solutions, determined by feelings, passions, and interests. From error to truth, there is no gradual ascent. The passage is described by Croce as a kind of spiritual conversion: the erring spirit, fleeing from the light, must convert itself in a researching spirit, eager for light; pride must yield to humility; the narrow love for one's abstract individuality, widen and lift itself to an austere love, to an utter devotion to that which is above the individual, becoming Bruno's eroico furore, Spinoza's amor Dei intellectualis. In this act of love and enthusiasm, the spirit becomes pure thought and attains the truth, or, rather, transforms itself into truth. And the possession of truth is at the same time possession of its contrary, of error transformed into truth; to possess a concept is to possess it in the fulness of its relations, and therefore to possess, in the same act, all the ways in which that concept, for instance, of the sthetic activity, is at the same time the concept of hedonism, intellectualism, empiricism, and so on. The two kinds of knowledge, that of truth and of its contrary, are inseparable: the concept is at the same time affirmation and negation. From this absolute possession of truth, we may distinguish a stage of research, which is not yet thought, but only the operation of the practical will creating certain conditions for thought. Seen in the light of this process, the series of errors through which a mind goes, when guided by a will to gather its materials and prepare itself to think, transforms itself into a series of attempts or hypotheses. An error is an error when there is a will to err; the hypothesis, however, into which the error is transmuted by the new will is not yet truth, and becomes truth only in the act of its verification; but it is no longer an error, because it does not affirm itself as truth, but only as a means or help for the conquest of truth. From this double consideration of the nature of error, first, as error which is conquered and comprehended by truth, and then as attempt or hypotheses in the service of truth, Croce derives the identification of the history of error with the history of truth, or philosophy. But not in the sense in which Hegel had considered the successive apparition of the various philosophical categories and of the various forms of error, seeing in them a kind of gradual revelation of his own philosophy. To Croce such a conception of the progress of philosophy is unacceptable. Philosophy as an abstract category, as one of the forms of the spiritual activity, has no origin in time, is not limited to the men we call philosophers, but acts in every moment of the life of the spirit on the material offered by history, which it contributes to create, and does not, therefore, progress any more than the categories of art or of morality. But it progresses in its concreteness, as art and the whole of life do; because life is development, and development is progress. Every affirmation of reality is conditioned by reality and conditions a new reality, which in its turn is, in its progress, the condition of a new thought and a new philosophy. In this perpetual cycle, though individual errors are conquered, no form of error can be definitely abolished; but they constantly reappear, because of the intrinsic necessity of their structure, and when they reappear not as wilful errors, but as attempts and hypotheses, they have their appointed function in the progress of truth and reality. To this constancy of error corresponds a constancy of truth: truth is not attained once and for ever, but is true in the act of its affirmation, and in proportion to its adequacy to the particular problem, to the individual conditions of fact, which necessarily include, at every given moment, the whole history of the past.""","""Philosophy, History, and Mythologism Relations""","1973","""Philosophy, history, and mythologism are interconnected realms that have influenced human thought and society for millennia. Each discipline offers unique insights into the human experience, shaping our understanding of the world and our place within it. By exploring the intersections of philosophy, history, and mythologism, we can unravel the complex tapestry of beliefs, ideologies, and narratives that have shaped civilizations throughout time.  Philosophy serves as the intellectual backbone of these disciplines, providing a framework for critical inquiry and reflection. From the ancient Greek philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle to modern thinkers like Kant, Nietzsche, and Foucault, philosophy has grappled with fundamental questions about existence, ethics, knowledge, and reality. Through rigorous examination and analysis, philosophers seek to uncover underlying principles that govern our understanding of the world and our place in it.  History, on the other hand, offers a retrospective lens through which we can examine the development of human societies over time. By studying past events, cultures, and movements, historians aim to create a cohesive narrative of human progress and regression. History provides context for philosophical ideas, showing how they have evolved and influenced societies throughout different eras. By tracing the evolution of philosophical thought within historical contexts, we gain a deeper appreciation of the interconnectedness of ideas and events.  Mythologism, while distinct from philosophy and history, plays a crucial role in shaping cultural beliefs, values, and identities. Myths are narratives that convey symbolic truths about the human experience, often rooted in archetypes, symbols, and allegories. From creation myths to hero journeys, myths provide a lens through which societies make sense of the world and imbue it with meaning. Mythologism intersects with philosophy and history by influencing belief systems, moral codes, and societal structures, reflecting shared values and aspirations across cultures.  The relationship between philosophy, history, and mythologism is dynamic and multifaceted. Philosophy challenges assumptions and beliefs, pushing us to question the foundations of knowledge and morality. History contextualizes philosophical ideas within specific time periods and cultural contexts, illustrating their practical implications and real-world consequences. Mythologism, in turn, infuses philosophical and historical narratives with symbolic power and emotional resonance, shaping collective identities and worldviews.  One example of this interconnectedness can be seen in the concept of justice. Philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle have grappled with the nature of justice, debating whether it is an inherent virtue or a social construct. Their ideas were influenced by historical events like the rise and fall of Athenian democracy, where questions of justice played a central role. Meanwhile, myths and religious narratives often depict divine figures delivering justice or emphasizing moral lessons, reinforcing cultural norms and values related to justice.  Another example is the concept of fate or destiny. Philosophers like the Stoics and Existentialists have explored the tension between determinism and free will, questioning whether individuals have control over their destinies. Historical events, such as wars, revolutions, and natural disasters, have shaped societies' beliefs in fate and providence. Mythologism, through stories of prophecies, oracles, and fate-deciding deities, has perpetuated beliefs in predestination and cosmic order.  Ultimately, the interconnectedness of philosophy, history, and mythologism highlights the complexity of human thought and culture. By examining how these disciplines intersect and influence one another, we gain a richer understanding of the forces that have shaped our worldviews, beliefs, and values. Philosophy challenges us to critically reflect on our assumptions, history contextualizes our philosophical inquiries within broader narratives, and mythologism infuses our beliefs with meaning and symbolism.  As we navigate the intricacies of philosophy, history, and mythologism, it becomes apparent that they are not isolated fields of study but rather threads woven into the fabric of human experience. Whether pondering existential questions, analyzing past events, or delving into mythic narratives, we are engaging with interconnected layers of meaning that enrich our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. In this way, philosophy, history, and mythologism continue to shape our intellectual pursuits, cultural expressions, and existential inquiries, offering a profound tapestry of human thought and imagination.""","845"
"Bevan Edward","""This however was an unusual quantity; a hive or box, of the dimensions recommended in this work, may be considered as well stocked when it yields from 0 to 0lbs. of honey. The honey intended for early use, and for the nursing-bees and drones, is deposited in cells which are allowed to remain open, and is probably of an inferior sort; whilst the finest honey, which is laid up in store for winter, is placed in the most inaccessible parts of the hive, and closed in the cells with waxen lids. 'There cluster'd now clear wells of nectar glow, Like amber drops that sparkle in the Po, And one short moon Shrinks with waned crescent mid the blaze of noon. All veil'd from view, these amber drops are lost. And each clear well with waxen crown embost.' Evans. In the Philosophical Transactions for 792, Mr. Hunter has stated, that whatever time the contents of the honey-bags may be retained, they still remain pure and unaltered by the digestive process. Mr. Polhill, a gentleman to whom the public are indebted for several articles in Rees's Cyclopdia appertaining to bees, is also of this opinion. Messrs. Kirby and Spence do not admit this statement: as the nectar of flowers is not of so thick a consistence as honey, they think it must undergo some change in the stomach of the bee. This opinion is strengthened by what has been stated by Reaumur: he observed that if there was a deficiency of flowers, at the season of honey-gathering, and the bees were furnished with sugar, they filled their cells with honey, differing in no other respect from honey collected in the usual way, but in its possessing a somewhat higher flavour and in its never candying, nor even losing its fluidity by long keeping. The same may be observed when they imbibe the juices of sweet fruits, for bees do not confine themselves solely to flowers and honey-dewed leaves; they will sometimes very greedily absorb the juice of raspberries for instance, and thus spoil them for the table; they also visit in crowds the vats of the cider and wine maker. Reaumur has likewise remarked, that in each honey-cell there is a cream-like layer or covering, of a thicker consistence than the honey itself, which apparently serves to retain the more liquid collections that may from time to time be introduced under it. Messrs. Kirby and Spence say, that if honey were the unaltered nectar of flowers, it would be difficult to conceive how this cream could be collected in proper proportions. This observation is made, in consequence of their presuming that some of this cream-like covering is conveyed into the cells with each deposition of fresh honey; and it has been supposed that this cream was the last portion disgorged. According to an article in Rees's Cyclopdia, probably written by Mr. Polhill, this cream-like matter is formed at the very first, and every addition of honey is deposited beneath it. The bee, entering into the cell as deeply as possible, puts forward its anterior pair of legs, and with them pierces a hole through the crust or cream: while this hole is kept open by the feet, the bee disgorges the honey in large drops from its mouth; these, falling into the hole, mix with the mass below: the bee, before it flies off, new-models the crust, and closes up the hole. This mode of proceeding is regularly adopted by every bee that contributes to the general store. The power of regurgitation in the bee is very remarkable: its alimentary organs, like those of the pigeon, besides being subservient to the purpose of nutriment, afford it a temporary storeroom or reservoir. Ruminating animals may be considered as regurgitating animals, though in them the operation is performed for different purposes. In some it is exercised for the purpose of digesting the food, in others for feeding the young; but in bees its use is to enable them to disburden themselves of the honey which they gather for the winter's store of the community. The finest flavoured and most delicate honey is that which is collected from aromatic plants, and has been stored in clean new cells: it has been usually called virgin-honey, as though it were elaborated by a fresh swarm of bees; but this is not essential to the perfection of honey, for, provided the cells in which it is deposited have never contained either brood or farina, it is not material whether it have been collected by swarms or by old stocks; the season and the flowers having been the same, the quality of the honey will in both cases be alike. F. Lamberti asserts, that the best honey in the world is produced in Pontus, and that its superiority is attributable to the great quantity of balm growing there. In this quarter of the world, the Narbonne honey is regarded as the finest, owing to the rosemary which abounds in the neighbourhood of Narbonne. 'The honey, for which Narbonne is so deservedly celebrated, is every year diminishing. Bees have ceased to be an object of attention to the peasantry; they now devote their time to the vineyards, and neglect the bees. The flowers of the wild plants, in the neighbourhood of Narbonne, are highly aromatic, and give the flavour which is peculiar to its honey: this peculiarity is attributed exclusively to the wild rosemary, Rosmarinus officinalis.' (Duppa's Miscellaneous Observations and Opinions on the Continent. 825/8.) Attempts are said to have been made to imitate Narbonne honey, by adding to other honey an infusion of rosemary flowers. Of the power which some flowers possess of imparting deleterious qualities to their honey, I have already spoken in the chapter on Pasturage. I will here add, however, what has been said of the appearance of this pernicious kind of honey. It is usually distinguished from what is innocent, by its crimson or reddish brown colour, its bitter flavour, and thicker consistence; but in Florida and Carolina it is so similar, in all respects, to innocent honey, that the hunters depend upon experience only, and, knowing that bad honey soon shows its effects, they at first eat very sparingly. The converse of this would appear in the 'blood-red honey' found by Mr. Bruce at Dixan in Abyssinia, to which he ascribes no evil properties. (Travels to the Nile, vol. v.) Linnus informs us, that in Sweden, the honey of autumn is principally gathered from the flowers of the Erica or Heath, and that it has a reddish cast. The honey of our native heaths is also of the same colour. Dr. Barton has observed that during his residence at Edinburgh, the Highland honey was often of a dirty brownish colour, which was supposed to be given to it by the 'blooming hather,' as Burns calls it: the people of Edinburgh, however, though great consumers of it, never complain of any ill effects from it. It produced upon the Doctor a soporific effect. The most innocent honey will often disagree with those who take it in large quantities, or who have irritable bowels; usually, in such cases, it produces purging, and sometimes griping pain. The mischievous qualities of honey have been said to be destroyed by boiling and straining, or even by long keeping only; yet when made into metheglin, it has been found as deleterious as ever. The quality of honey varies with the time of gathering, and that even though the whole season may have been favourable. The collection at the commencement of summer is regarded as the prime honey of the year, the flowers being then most abundant, and in the full glow of health; and that which is collected in spring is superior to the gleanings of autumn. Huber+ states that the secretion of honey and the formation of wax are singularly promoted by electricity: hence the works may always be observed to advance rapidly when there is a southerly wind, a moist warm air, and an impending storm; whereas the secretion is impeded, and sometimes suspended, by long protracted droughts, cold rains, and a northerly wind. Prime honey is of a whitish colour, an agreeable smell, a pleasant taste, and a thick consistence. When taken from the combs it is in a fluid state, but gradually thickens by age, and in cold weather, if genuine, it becomes firm and solid. In England, it has seldom, if ever, been known to assume this solid state while in the hives; and even out of them, if it remain in the combs, it will preserve its clearness, purity and fine flavour, for at least a year. The honey of tropical climates is always in a fluid state. Vide chapter on Exotic Bees. Much of the fine flavour of honey will depend upon the manner of its separation from the comb. That will be the most delicate which flows spontaneously from the purest and whitest combs; the next in excellence will be that which is expressed without heat; and the coarsest, that which is obtained by the aid of heat and pressure. Care should be taken in the selection of the vessels used for storing honey; the most appropriate are jars of stone ware, called Bristol ware. The principal constituents of sugar and honey are the same; viz. hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Besides these their common elements, honey contains mucilage and extractive matter, and also an excess of oxygen: in plain English, honey possesses a greater proportion of acid than is contained in sugar, and in a state more capable of acting upon those bodies with which it comes in contact. From this the reader will perceive my reason for recommending stone jars for its preservation: the acid of the honey acting upon the lead with which every other kind of earthenware is glazed, causes the honey to receive an impregnation from it, which may prove injurious to those whose constitutions are delicate: the stone ware, being glazed with common salt, cannot communicate any injurious property to the honey which is stored in it. Honey should be kept in a cool and dry situation, as warmth promotes fermentation and generates a sensible acidity.""","""Beekeeping and honey production""","2137","""Beekeeping, also known as apiculture, is the practice of maintaining colonies of honeybees in hives for the purpose of collecting their honey, beeswax, propolis, royal jelly, and pollen. This ancient practice dates back thousands of years and plays a crucial role in agriculture and ecosystem sustainability. Beekeeping is not only about harvesting honey; it also supports pollination, which is essential for the reproduction of many plants, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the fascinating world of beekeeping, exploring the process of honey production, the importance of bees, and the benefits of sustainable beekeeping practices.  ## Importance of Bees Bees are essential pollinators that play a significant role in maintaining biodiversity, ecosystem health, and food production. It is estimated that about one-third of the food we consume relies on pollination by bees. Bees transfer pollen from one flower to another, enabling the fertilization and production of fruits and seeds. Without bees, many plants would not be able to reproduce, leading to a decrease in crop yields and the loss of various plant species. Bees are not only vital for agriculture but also for natural ecosystems, as they contribute to the pollination of wild plants, ensuring the survival of diverse habitats and wildlife populations.  ## The Honeybee Colony A honeybee colony consists of three main types of bees: the queen, worker bees, and drones. The queen bee is the reproductive female of the colony, responsible for laying eggs and maintaining the population. Worker bees are non-reproductive females that perform various tasks such as foraging for nectar and pollen, caring for the brood, and building and maintaining the hive. Drones are male bees whose primary role is to mate with the queen during the mating flight. The hive is organized with a complex social structure, where each bee has specific roles and responsibilities essential for the survival and functioning of the colony.  ## Hive Management Beekeepers engage in hive management practices to ensure the health and productivity of their bee colonies. These practices include providing adequate shelter and protection for the bees, monitoring the hive for signs of disease or pests, feeding bees during times of scarcity, and harvesting honey at the appropriate time. Hive inspections are conducted regularly to check the overall health of the colony, assess honey stores, and ensure the queen is laying eggs consistently. Proper hive management is crucial for maximizing honey production, promoting bee welfare, and preventing the spread of diseases within the colony.  ## Honey Production Process The process of honey production begins with foraging worker bees collecting nectar from flowers. The nectar is stored in their honey sacs and brought back to the hive, where it is passed to other worker bees for further processing. The bees then evaporate the moisture from the nectar by fanning their wings, transforming it into honey. Once the moisture content is reduced to around 17-20%, the bees cap the honey cells with beeswax to seal and preserve the honey. Beekeepers harvest honey by removing the capped honey frames from the hive and extracting the honey using a centrifugal extractor. The extracted honey is then filtered to remove any impurities before being bottled for consumption.  ## Types of Honey Honey comes in a variety of flavors, colors, and textures, depending on the types of flowers from which the bees collect nectar. Monofloral honey is produced when bees predominantly forage from a single type of flower, resulting in honeys such as clover honey, orange blossom honey, or lavender honey, each with its distinct characteristics. Polyfloral honey, also known as wildflower honey, is gathered from a mix of different flowers and plants, creating a more diverse flavor profile. Raw honey, which is minimally processed and not heated, retains more of its natural enzymes, nutrients, and flavors compared to commercial honey that undergoes pasteurization.  ## Benefits of Honey Honey is not only a delicious natural sweetener but also boasts various health benefits. It contains antioxidants, enzymes, vitamins, and minerals that contribute to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and soothing properties. Honey has been used for centuries in traditional medicine to treat wounds, sore throats, coughs, and allergies. Its unique composition makes it an excellent alternative to refined sugar, offering a healthier option for sweetening foods and beverages. Consuming local raw honey is believed to help with seasonal allergies by introducing small amounts of pollen into the body, potentially desensitizing the immune system over time.  ## Sustainable Beekeeping Practices In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable beekeeping practices to protect bee populations and promote biodiversity. Sustainable beekeeping focuses on practices that prioritize the health and well-being of bees, reduce the impact of beekeeping on the environment, and support biodiversity conservation. These practices include providing a diverse range of flowering plants for bees to forage on, avoiding the use of pesticides that harm bees, promoting genetic diversity within bee populations, and practicing responsible hive management techniques. Sustainable beekeepers also engage in hive sharing, pollinator-friendly farming, and education initiatives to raise awareness about the vital role of bees in ecosystems.  ## Challenges Facing Beekeeping Despite the critical role that bees play in agriculture and the environment, bee populations around the world are facing numerous threats. Pesticide use, habitat loss, climate change, pollution, diseases, and pests such as Varroa mites pose significant challenges to bee health and survival. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is a phenomenon where entire bee colonies suddenly disappear, with factors such as pesticide exposure, pathogens, and nutritional stress believed to contribute to this phenomenon. To address these challenges, beekeepers, researchers, policymakers, and the public must work together to implement sustainable practices, support bee-friendly policies, and raise awareness about the importance of bees in our food system and ecosystems.  ## Conclusion Beekeeping and honey production are not only ancient practices rooted in tradition but also vital components of agriculture, ecology, and food security. Bees are indispensable pollinators that support the reproduction of countless plant species, ensuring the abundance of fruits, vegetables, and nuts that we rely on for nutrition. By engaging in sustainable beekeeping practices, protecting bee habitats, and supporting bee populations, we can safeguard the future of bees and promote a healthy environment for future generations. The next time you enjoy a spoonful of golden honey, remember the industrious bees that work tirelessly to produce this natural treasure, and the beekeepers who care for them with dedication and passion.""","1319"
"Humphreys John H ","""The system, however, possesses no elasticity. No party can put forward a complete list of candidates without incurring considerable risk, and even if the party has an ascertained strength of more than three-fifths complete victory is only possible if the members of the party are willing to carry out implicitly the instructions of the party organization. It should be noted, in connexion with this system of voting, that the more limited the vote the greater is the opportunity afforded to the minority to obtain representation. When in a four-member constituency each elector has three votes the minority must number three-sevenths before it can obtain a representative; if, however, each elector is limited to two votes a smaller minority, namely, a minority which exceeds one-third of the electors, can make sure of returning a member. The Cumulative Vote.] The Cumulative Vote, the second of the experiments referred to by Lord Ripen, although by no means free from serious defects, has also secured the object for which it was designed--the representation of minorities. With this system the member has as many votes as there are members to be elected, and is permitted to distribute them amongst candidates, or to cumulate them among one or more candidates according to his own discretion. It was warmly advocated for the first time under the name of the Cumulative Vote by James Garth Marshall in an open letter entitled 'Minorities and Majorities: their Relative Rights,' addressed by him in 85/83 to Lord John Russell. But three years earlier, in 85/80, it was recommended by the Committee of the Privy Council for Trade and Plantations, and adopted by Earl Grey in the draft Constitution proposed for the Cape of Good Hope. The Legislative Council of Cape Colony continued to be elected under this system until the Council disappeared under the new Constitution of United South Africa. The Cumulative Vote secured the representation of minorities in the Legislative Council of Cape Colony, and a striking testimony to its value, from this point of view, was given by Lord Milner when speaking in the House of Lords on 1 July 906, on the announcement of the terms of the new Transvaal Constitution:-- 'I hope,' said Lord Milner, 'that when the time for making the Second Chamber elective comes, this matter may be reconsidered, for it is certainly very remarkable how much more fairly the system of proportional representation works out in the Cape Colony than the system, not of single members there, but of double-member representation. Take only a single instance. In the Cape Colony, take the bulk of the country districts; you have, roughly speaking, about two Boers to every one white man who is not a Boer. On the system which prevails for the Lower House the representation of these districts is exclusively Boer, for one-third of the population is absolutely excluded from any representation whatever. Under the system which prevails in the election to the Upper House, as nearly as possible one-third of the representatives of those districts are British. Inversely, in the case of the Cape Peninsula, where there is an enormously preponderant British population, but still a considerable Dutch population also, you get in the Lower House no single Dutch representative, whereas in the Upper House there are three representatives, one of whom represents the Dutch section. You could not have a more curious illustration of the great difference in fairness between the two principles as applied to the practical conditions of South Africa. And I cannot help hoping that between this time and the time when the Constitution of the projected Upper House comes to be decided, there may be such a development of opinion as will enable and justify the Government of that day adopting the far sounder principle for the elections to the Upper Chamber. It certainly has a great bearing upon that development of better feeling between the two great races of South Africa whom we are all agreed in desiring to see ultimately amalgamated and fused.' The Cape Assembly was elected by constituencies returning one or more members, and when more than one each voter could give a single vote to as many candidates as there were members to be elected, with the consequence that the majority in every constituency commanded the whole of its representation. The Council was elected by larger areas with the cumulative vote. Lord Milner in his speech refers to the cumulative vote as proportional voting, but it cannot, strictly speaking, be so described. Nevertheless his testimony clearly shows that the cumulative vote secured the representation of minorities--the great need of which has been recognized by all impartial students of South African political conditions. Mr. Robert Lowe endeavoured to introduce this form of voting into the Electoral Reform Bill of 867, but failed, and the only practical application of the system within the United Kingdom has been in connexion with School Board elections. It was introduced into the Education Act of 870 on the motion of a private member, Lord Frederick Cavendish, whose proposition, supported as it was by W.E. Forster, Vice-President of the Council for Education, by W.H. Smith and by Henry Fawcett, was carried without a division. Under this Act London was divided into eleven electoral areas, returning from four to seven members each; whilst the large towns, such as Manchester, Birmingham, and others, each constituted an electoral area itself, electing a Board of some fifteen members. The Education Act for Scotland which followed in the same Parliament embodied the same principle in the-same manner. The figures of any School Board election will show that the object aimed at--the representation of minorities--was undoubtedly achieved. The last election of the School Board for London, that of 900, will serve for purposes of illustration. The figures are as follows:-- Votes Obtained. Members Returned. Constituency. Mode- Pro- Inde- Mode- Pro- Inde- rate. gressive. pendent. rate. gressive. pendent. City,, Chelsea,,, Finsbury,, Greenwich,,, Hackney,,, Lambeth, E,,, Lambeth, W.,, Marylebone,, Southwark,,, Tower Hamlets,,, Westminster,, Totals 8,,, In each constituency the minority was enabled to obtain some representation, and although in the majority of cases the representation was still confined to the two main parties, yet it was possible for an independent candidate, as in the Tower Hamlets, or a Roman Catholic candidate, as in Southwark, to succeed in their respective candidatures. The Cumulative Vote not only secured the representation of minorities, but in so doing facilitated very considerably the working of the Education Act. Mr. Patrick Cumin, at that time permanent secretary of the Education Department, in giving evidence before a select committee of the House of Commons, stated that 'it would not have been possible to carry the Act into effect, and certainly there would have been more friction if the cumulative vote had not been in existence; for instance, he did not believe that the bye-laws could possibly have been carried into effect without co-operation.' The Right Hon. W.E. Forster and Sir Francis Sandford bore similar testimony, and the Royal Commission on the Elementary Education Acts, in the Report issued in 888, strongly advised the retention of a system of minority representation. The Cumulative Vote was also adopted by the State of Illinois for the elections to the State House of Representatives. Each constituency returns three members, and the elector may cumulate or divide his votes, giving one vote to each candidate, or one and a half votes to each of two candidates, or three votes to one candidate. 'As a result,' says Professor Commons, 'both parties have representatives from every part of the State instead of from the strongholds only, and there are no hopeless minorities of the two main parties. Every citizen who has business before the Legislature has some member of his own party to transact that business.' Constituencies returning three members are, however, not sufficiently large to do justice to this method of voting. The Cumulative Vote, whilst securing representation to the minority, does not necessarily secure the representation of majorities and minorities in their true proportions. As with the Limited Vote, the party organizations, if they desire to make use of their polling strength to the fullest advantage, must make as accurate an estimate as possible of the numbers of their supporters, and must issue explicit directions as to the way in which votes should be recorded. To nominate more candidates than the party can carry may end in disaster. In the first School Board elections in Birmingham the Liberal organization endeavoured to obtain the whole of the representation, and nominated fifteen candidates. The party polled a majority of the votes, but as these votes were distributed over too many candidates, the Liberals succeeded in returning only a minority of representatives. It is not easy to understand how the Birmingham National League came to imagine that, with the Cumulative Vote, they would still be able to elect a Board composed of members entirely of their own side, and Mr. Forster banteringly suggested that the League should obtain the assistance of a well-taught elementary schoolboy who would be able to show them that it was impossible to get the return which they supposed they might obtain.""","""Cumulative Voting and Minority Representation""","1851","""Cumulative voting is a method used in corporate governance, organizations, and electoral systems to ensure minority representation and diversity in decision-making processes. Unlike traditional voting systems where each voter has one vote per candidate, cumulative voting allows voters to allocate multiple votes to a single candidate or distribute the votes among several candidates. This system enables minority shareholders or groups to have a greater impact on the outcome of elections or decisions, promoting inclusivity and equitable representation.   One of the key advantages of cumulative voting is its ability to amplify minority voices. This voting method empowers minority shareholders or underrepresented groups to pool their votes together, increasing their chances of electing a candidate of their choice. In situations where certain groups may be marginalized or lack sufficient representation, cumulative voting provides a mechanism for them to have a seat at the table and influence decision-making processes. This can lead to more diverse perspectives being considered and result in more inclusive outcomes.  Moreover, cumulative voting promotes fairness and equity by ensuring that all stakeholders have a voice in the decision-making process. In traditional voting systems, majority rule can sometimes overlook the interests and concerns of minority groups. Cumulative voting addresses this issue by allowing minority shareholders or groups to have a say in the selection of candidates or proposals. This helps prevent the tyranny of the majority and encourages a more balanced and representative approach to governance.  In the context of corporate governance, cumulative voting is often used in board elections to guarantee that minority shareholders have a meaningful impact on the composition of the board. By enabling shareholders to concentrate their votes on candidates they support, cumulative voting introduces a level of democratic governance that reflects the diverse interests within an organization. This can lead to a board that is more reflective of the company's shareholder base and better equipped to make decisions that consider the perspectives of all stakeholders.  Furthermore, cumulative voting can foster collaboration and cooperation among different interest groups. By providing a mechanism for diverse voices to be heard, this voting method encourages dialogue and consensus-building. Minority shareholders or groups may find common ground with other stakeholders when they realize the shared benefits of working together toward common goals. This collaborative approach can lead to more effective decision-making processes and ultimately benefit the organization as a whole.  Despite its advantages, cumulative voting also has limitations and challenges. One potential drawback is the complexity of the voting process, which may confuse some voters and lead to lower voter participation. Additionally, cumulative voting can sometimes be manipulated or misused, especially in cases where certain groups attempt to consolidate power by strategically allocating their votes. To address these concerns, it is important to establish clear rules and guidelines for implementing cumulative voting and ensure transparency in the voting process.  In conclusion, cumulative voting is a valuable tool for promoting minority representation and diversity in decision-making. By giving minority shareholders or groups a greater voice in elections and governance, cumulative voting helps create more inclusive and equitable systems. While there are challenges to overcome, the benefits of cumulative voting in empowering underrepresented voices and fostering collaboration make it a compelling option for organizations and electoral systems looking to enhance minority representation and promote a more inclusive democratic process.""","608"
"Stephenson Gilbert Thomas","""He left, and later brought suit. At the trial, it appeared that the discrimination was not with the sanction of the proprietor, that he had told the waiter to serve Negroes, that the waiter had refused to do so and was discharged therefor. Nevertheless, the court held that the proprietor was liable for the act of his servant, and gave compensatory damages to the Negro. The next year, a restaurant keeper refused to accommodate a Negro in Lucas County, Ohio, and the court allowed the Negro to recover the penalty prescribed by the law. The case was decided on a question of evidence. In 905/8 a Negro was serving on the jury in a civil case in Iowa. The bailiff had arranged with a boarding-house to serve meals. When the Negro, along with the other jurors, went for his meals, the boarding-house keeper refused to allow him to sit at the same table with the others. It was not questioned that this was in violation of the Civil Rights Bill of the State if the boarding-house was an eating-house within the terms of the statute. The court charged the jury that such an eating-house as would come within the statute must be a place where meals are served to anyone applying at the same prices charged to all, but that, if meals are served only in pursuance of a previous arrangement for particular individuals, rather than anyone who may apply, it is a private boarding-house and not within the statute. Thirteen States provide that barbers must serve all persons without regard to race or color. In 889 a barber in Lincoln, Nebraska, refused to shave a Negro because he was colored. The Civil Rights Bill of that State mentions barbers. The court held: A barber, by opening a shop and putting out his sign, thereby invites every orderly and well-behaved person who may desire his services to enter his shop during business hours. The statute will not permit him to say to one, you were a slave or the son of a slave, therefore I will not shave you. Such prejudices are unworthy of our better manhood, and are clearly prohibited by the statute. Barber-shops were included within the provisions of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Bill in 893, but, as a matter of fact, Negroes are not even now given the same accommodations as whites in barber-shops in Massachusetts. The statute of Connecticut requires equality of service in places of public accommodation. A barber refused to serve one Faulkner because he was a Negro, and the latter brought suit on the ground that a barber-shop is a place of public accommodation and, hence, within the Civil Rights Bill of the State. The court held that the barber-shop is not, in its nature, different from the places of business run for private gain, and that the common law has never recognized it as possessing the quality of a place of public accommodation, as a hotel, public conveyance, etc. It may be added here that most of the cases have involved the point as to what are places of public accommodation or amusement or resort. If the place is mentioned in the Civil Rights Bill, it is, of course, within the prohibition, and it is a violation of the statute even to require separate accommodations, although equal in every other respect. But a vast deal of litigation has arisen out of instances of Negroes being denied accommodation in places considered public in their nature but which are not mentioned in the Civil Rights Bill of the State wherein the case arises. In the year 901, Basso, a bootblack in the basement of one of the business houses of Rochester, New York, refused to serve Burks because the latter was a Negro. The law of New York, as has been seen, requires full and equal accommodations in hotels and other places of public accommodation. The question, therefore, was: Is a bootblack stand a place of public accommodation? The municipal court of Rochester, in which Burks brought suit, gave judgment for him, thereby answering the question in the affirmative. The county court reversed the decision. The appellate division reversed the county court and sustained the municipal. The court of appeals reversed the appellate division thereby sustaining the county court, saying: A bootblacking stand may be said to be a place of public accommodation, like the store of a dry goods merchant, a grocer, or the proverbial butcher, baker, and candlestick maker; but that is very far from placing it in the same category with the places specifically named in the statute. Inns, hotels, and public conveyances are places of public accommodation in the broadest sense, because they have always been denominated as such under the common law. Bath-houses and barber-shops are not to be regarded as included within the statute under the general phrase, and all other places of public accommodation. There is no more relation between a bootblacking stand and a public conveyance than there is between a theatre or music-hall and a bath-house or barber-shop. There is, it is true, a superficial resemblance between the occupation of the barber and that of the bootblack, in the sense that both minister to the personal comfort and convenience of others; but the same argument could be extended far beyond the limits necessary to demonstrate that not all other places of public accommodation are included by relation within the category of the things specifically enumerated in the statute. In Massachusetts in 866, a certain Negro was refused, because of his race or color, the use of a billiard-room. At that time a statute of the Commonwealth required equal accommodation in public places of amusement. The Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in which the Negros case was finally heard, held that there was no proof that the room was licensed, and added: It cannot be supposed that it was the intent of the legislature to prescribe the manner in which persons should use their own premises or permit others to use them, if they did not carry on therein an occupation or business, or suffer other persons to appropriate them to a purpose, which required a license in order to render such an appropriation lawful. Only two States, Minnesota and Wisconsin, mention saloons in their Civil Rights Bills. And in Minnesota, they were not added till 899, as a result of the following case: A Negro was denied accommodation in a saloon. At that time, the statute required equal accommodations in inns and places of public resort, refreshment, accommodation, or entertainment. The court of that State, in passing on the case, held that a saloon is not among the other places of public refreshment. The court suggests that or other means other such like and includes only places of the same nature as those already mentioned specifically in the statute. About the Negro, the court said: It is a well-known fact that, owing to an unreasonable race prejudice which still exists to some extent, the promiscuous entertainment of persons of different races in places where intoxicating drinks are sold not infrequently result in personal conflicts, especially when the passions of men are inflamed by liquor. Hence the legislature might have omitted saloons for that reason. The next year the legislature answered otherwise by adding saloons to the Civil Rights Bill. In 899 a bar-keeper in Ohio charged a Negro thirty cents for a cocktail, the regular price to white customers being only fifteen cents. The Civil Rights Bill of Ohio did not mention saloons, but said other places of public accommodation and amusement. The court held that saloons were not included, adding, in the same spirit as the Minnesota court. nor should we interpret this statute as encouraging a tariff which the clearly defined policy of the State discourages. A statute of Louisiana of 908 requires separate saloons for white and colored persons. The Louisiana court, in July, 909, held that the sale of liquor to white and colored persons must not be conducted in the same building, and that the statute is not obeyed by providing separate bars in the same building. The saloon keeper had attempted to avoid paying taxes on two saloons by operating two bars in the same building. In Atlanta, before State prohibition began, there were separate saloons for the white and colored people. An ordinance of Nashville, Tennessee, which went into effect July, 907, required the segregation of the races in saloons. SODA The keeper of a soda fountain in Illinois in 896 refused to sell cold drinks to a Negro. At that time the law required equal accommodation in inns and all other places of accommodation and amusement. The court of that State held that a soda fountain is not such a place of accommodation or amusement. Such a place, the court argued, can be considered a place of accommodation or amusement to no greater extent than a places where dry goods or clothing, boots and shoes, hats and caps, or groceries, are dispensed. The personal liberty of an individual in his business transactions, and his freedom from restrictions, is a question of utmost moment, and no construction can be adopted by which an individual right of action will be included as controlled within a legislative enactment, unless clearly expressed in such enactment and certainly included within the constitutional limitation on the power of the legislature. The question of the rights of Negroes in theatres has given rise to a number of judicial decisions. Fifteen States provide by statute that there shall be no race distinction in theatres. In 873, the laws of Mississippi, under the Reconstruction government, declared that all persons, without distinction as to race, color, or previous condition of servitude, should have equal and impartial enjoyment of theatres.""","""Civil Rights and Racial Discrimination""","1928","""The ongoing struggle for civil rights and the fight against racial discrimination has been a central theme in the history of the United States and many other countries around the world. From the abolition of slavery to the civil rights movements of the 20th century and beyond, individuals and communities have worked tirelessly to advance the cause of equality and justice for all. Despite significant progress over the years, racial discrimination continues to persist in various forms, highlighting the importance of ongoing efforts to address systemic inequalities and promote inclusivity.  The concept of civil rights encompasses the basic rights and freedoms that every individual is entitled to by virtue of their humanity. These rights include but are not limited to the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; freedom of speech and religion; the right to vote and participate in the political process; and equal protection under the law. Civil rights are essential for creating a society where all individuals have the opportunity to thrive and contribute to the common good.  Racial discrimination, on the other hand, is the unjust or prejudicial treatment of individuals or groups based on their race or ethnic background. This form of discrimination can manifest in various ways, including but not limited to systemic racism, racial profiling, hate crimes, unequal access to opportunities and resources, and disparities in education, employment, healthcare, and criminal justice. Racial discrimination not only undermines the dignity and rights of individuals but also erodes social cohesion and perpetuates inequalities within society.  Throughout history, marginalized communities, particularly Black Americans, Indigenous peoples, Latinx individuals, Asian Americans, and other people of color, have been at the forefront of movements for civil rights and social justice. From the abolitionist movement to the civil rights movement of the 1960s led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, to contemporary grassroots activism such as the Black Lives Matter movement, these efforts have sparked important legal and societal changes aimed at combating racial discrimination and promoting equality.  Legal milestones in the fight for civil rights include the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery, the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection under the law, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ensuring voting rights for all citizens. These legislative victories have been instrumental in dismantling institutionalized racism and advancing civil rights for all individuals, regardless of race.  Despite these achievements, racial discrimination persists in various forms, highlighting the need for continued advocacy, education, and policy reforms. Systemic racism, implicit bias, and prejudice continue to affect individuals and communities, leading to disparities in areas such as wealth, education, healthcare, and criminal justice. Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach that includes legislative reforms, community engagement, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and ongoing conversations about race and privilege.  In addition to legal and policy changes, promoting racial equality also requires individuals to examine their own beliefs, biases, and behaviors. Engaging in conversations about race, actively listening to marginalized voices, challenging stereotypes, and advocating for inclusive practices are essential steps in the journey towards a more just and equitable society. By acknowledging the impact of historical injustices and working towards addressing present-day inequalities, we can create a more inclusive and compassionate world for future generations.  In conclusion, the fight for civil rights and the struggle against racial discrimination are ongoing battles that require collective action and unwavering commitment. By upholding the principles of equality, justice, and respect for all individuals, we can work towards a society where every person has the opportunity to thrive and live free from discrimination. It is only through persistent advocacy, education, and solidarity that we can build a more inclusive and equitable world for all.""","746"
"Shiga Shigetsura","""Samurai thinks it a greatest honor to keep his family name among the martialhood as long as he can. He feels the greatest disdain or shame if his family name is discarded from a list of martialhood by any silly conduct, which can be redeemed only by death. This naturally inspires him with reverence of forefathers who had handed down the stainless family to his reign. Hence we see in many plans of houses of respectable Samurai a room preserved for images of forefathers. This is not only found in the house of class but in all classes of citizens and this for the most part may be ascribed to the effect of Buddhism and Shintoism, the national religions of Japan. Samurai, however is rather indifferent in regard to religious matters in comparison with other classes of society; though the spirit of honor or something like chivalric idea of middle ages in Europe was heightened to the utmost. As to the idea or conception of Samurai Professor Inazo Nitobe in his recent work Bushido, the soul of Japan treats it in full detail, my conception on the same may not precisely conform with Professor Nitobe, still I believe there may not be a great contradiction between us. On the whole in the feudal system of a government the relation of a Daimio or a leader of Samurai to the latter is well manifested in a like feature in the relation between Samurai and his retainers. The shadow of feudal systems is cast in everywhere in social life and even the planning and construction of a house is greatly modified by it. It is curious to note that so called American balloon frame construction represents the idea of Americanism, the democracy, each member having no special office particularly assigned to it, yet stands firmly by joint strain. I do not for a moment deduce that a system or a form of government has any direct connection to the construction of a house; but it modifies greatly in the planning of a house for the reason that a plan of a house evolves a national idea. This is well illustrated by the plan of both American and Japanese dwelling houses. Is it not also strange to observe that by studying the construction of our peasants house which has a middle, main post called a Daikoku- which all structural stability is concentrated? A construction well suited to the aristocratic form of state only having no king post or queen post; but have Daikoku-bashira! When aristocracy in connection with feudal system was the form of government the family life of Daimio was simply a smaller type of it and Samurai and other wealthy families were still smaller of types of government; thus the house plan was made to conform with their traits. The fact that the form of government of a state modifies the architecture of the dwelling house is also exemplified by the house of England and France of the sixteenth century. Indeed, most of our houses of today were chiefly modeled after the prototype of former Samurai houses. Now the spirits of commonwealth and liberty pervade all through the country; daisho (long and short swords borne by Samurai) were thrown away, cut off, even the clothing was partly changed and yet we are faithfully following a mode of living which is half obsolete. Japan is in the state of transition from old to new from destruction to upheaval in architecture and in every thing. Cannot we hope to create a new design unless the old had been destroyed? The houses as any other objects of utility should be improved by keeping abreast with the advancement of science. The house as a thing which has a money value and useful object to contain human beings, is not different from the railroad train and the steam boat. While a marked progress in these is being noticed from time to time what have we done for the house? We have shown a certain improvement in aspect by adopting European architectural style in house design, but a very little alteration has been done in its plan. What improvement have we accomplished toward its construction, materials, decoration, and workmanship? Besides the use of glass in shoji, iron and zinc plates in roof and gutter, what else have we used but ordinary building materials which have been handed down from time immemorial? What is the difference between our houses and those of our ancestors in aspect, construction, materials, and workmanship? The history of Japanese dwelling houses is a subject not well studied by any architect or man of literature. Though much light has been thrown on the history of Japanese religious architecture by Professor Ito of the Imperial university of Tokyo, we can infer very little from him as to how our dwelling houses were in the past. Religious buildings and palaces form an important element in the history of architecture in all nations, and Japan is no exception. But it is not the aim of this theme to give a historical sketch of Japanese architecture from its earliest time, the object being only to show here the stage of development of our houses and thus I mean to infer that an important change should take place in the future. The history of Japan dates as far back as six hundred sixty years before the Christian era. Before this date we call it the legendary era. According to the decree of administrative court of Shinki it says in our legendary era the people were primitive, living in caves in winter and nestling on trees in summer, we can imagine from this that in earliest time we were cave dwellers in winter and tree nestlers in summer like natives of New Guinea of the present time. In time of Jimmu the founder of the Japanese houses developed in wooden type and henceforth wood became the only building material. Early Japanese houses had no decoration whatever and it seems to me that since 90 A.D. when Coreans brought some coloring pigments as tribute to the government of Jingo-Kogo the painting was applied for the first time to the building, but it is certain that the color was applied only to the palace not to the to the dwelling houses. The dwelling houses. The dwelling houses were much improved in the time of Shomu, (67 A.D.) the zenith of religious architecture. It was then that tiles were used for the first time as the roof covering in common dwelling houses which before that time were mostly covered by the bark of hinoki. (Thuya Obtusa, Benth) In common houses tiles were not yet used so abundantly as in temple roofs; they were used on the ridge only; the rest being covered by barks of wood. The plastered wall was also introduced at this time. It may, however, be remembered that that plaster consisted of lime and sand. Perhaps having some mud in the mixture; no gypsum was in use as in European plaster. The ages between eighth and twelfth centuries, which includes a little more than three hundred and eighty years, when the Fujiwara family played an important role in the government formed a most prominent epoch of art and literature in the history of Japan. The long, peaceful reign generally ensues an effeminate tendency to the spirit of a nation especially to the nobility who had every facility to possess every thing at call. The result is the production of Azumaya or Shinden-tsukuri. The plan of which is by no means a desirable type of residence even for a nobility of today. But, to be sure, it served the requirement of the day in which the higher class of people indulged mostly in music and poetry, festival and pleasure. The plan of the Shinden type reminds me of the notable building the Ho-oh-do which was built at this time that is some eight hundred years ago in Yamashiro and which still remains in this day in the same spot after long defacing action of nature. It had the honor of being reproduced in Jackson Park at Chicago in 893 as a representation of Japanese architecture. The plan of Shinden-tukuri consists of a main or middle building flanked with two wings or detached rooms on the east and west connected by porches. The size of the main building was generally 0 feet square, sometimes as large as 20 feet square and even as small as 0 feet square according to circumstances. The interior of the building consists of a main middle room surrounded by a wide corridor laid with mats, reception room, store room etc. being arranged in this corridor each room divided by curtains. The east and west wings were used as living rooms, and perhaps the kitchen was in a detached house. It is imagined from the arrangement of rooms that the house was not planned merely for the purpose of pleasure. The ninth century of Christian era which corresponds to Tun dynasty of China was a great era for introducing art and literature from China through the hands of Buddhist preachers who had been sent by the government to observe the civilization of China; Kobo-daishi and Saicho were most influential persons among scholars and religionists of the time. They returned home from their mission abroad well laden with the knowledge of art and literature which had been scattered all through the empire. The palace was planned on the largest scale ever carried on after the plan of a Chinese palace. The Shinden-tsukuri is undoubtedly a modification of the latter. Shoji and Fusuma were not used in Shinden-tsukuri, and in outside openings what is called Koshi (the framed lattice window hung vertically in a manner something like a vertical trap-door with thick white paper stretched on one side) was used. It is divided into two sashes the upper part of which is pushed outward, by means of stays, for ventilation.""","""Samurai culture and Japanese architecture""","1908","""Samurai Culture and Japanese Architecture   Japanese history is deeply intertwined with the unique and fascinating culture of the samurai, who were skilled warriors that played a significant role in shaping Japan's history. The samurai culture is a blend of discipline, honor, and loyalty that continues to captivate people worldwide. Alongside the samurai code, Japanese architecture stands out as an intricate reflection of the country's rich history and cultural heritage. Let's delve into the world of samurai culture and Japanese architecture to uncover the profound influence they have had on Japan and beyond.  The samurai were a class of highly-trained warriors in feudal Japan who held a unique position both politically and culturally. Emerging in the 12th century, they served as both protectors and enforcers of the law. The samurai code, known as Bushido, governed their way of life, emphasizing virtues such as loyalty, courage, and self-discipline. Bushido was not just a code of conduct but a way of life that defined the moral and ethical standards of the samurai.  Central to the samurai code was the concept of honor, known as """"giri."""" Honor was of utmost importance to the samurai, and they were willing to sacrifice their lives to maintain their honor and that of their families. This commitment to honor and duty is evident in historical accounts of samurai engagements in battle and their unwavering loyalty to their masters.  Another essential aspect of samurai culture was the focus on self-improvement and personal development. The samurai practiced various arts and disciplines, including tea ceremonies, calligraphy, poetry, and martial arts like kendo and kyudo. These pursuits were not just hobbies but integral to their development as warriors and individuals.  Japanese architecture also reflects the values and aesthetics of samurai culture. Traditional Japanese architecture is characterized by its simplicity, harmony with nature, and attention to detail. One of the most iconic architectural structures in Japan is the traditional wooden houses with sliding doors, known as """"shoji,"""" and tatami mat flooring.  Castles, such as Himeji Castle and Matsumoto Castle, are stunning examples of Japanese castle architecture that showcase both defensive strategies and intricate design. These castles often feature multiple layers of defense, including thick walls, moats, and hidden corridors, reflecting the strategic mindset of the samurai.  The Zen influence on Japanese architecture is also noteworthy. Zen temples, like Ryoanji Temple in Kyoto, embody simplicity, minimalism, and a deep connection to nature. Rock gardens, known as """"karesansui,"""" are a prominent feature of Zen temples and provide a serene space for contemplation and meditation.  The fusion of samurai culture and Japanese architecture is evident in the design of samurai residences and castles. Samurai homes, called """"buke yashiki,"""" were designed to accommodate the needs of the samurai and their families while reflecting their social status. These residences often featured elements such as tatami rooms, sliding doors, and inner gardens.  Japanese gardens, such as the famous garden at Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto, are another integral part of Japanese architecture. These meticulously landscaped gardens are designed to create a harmonious balance between human-made structures and the natural environment, embodying the Japanese reverence for nature.  In conclusion, samurai culture and Japanese architecture are deeply interconnected, reflecting the values, beliefs, and aesthetics of Japan's rich cultural heritage. The discipline, honor, and commitment to excellence embodied by the samurai are evident in the meticulous design and thoughtful construction of Japanese architectural marvels. By exploring the world of samurai culture and Japanese architecture, we gain a deeper appreciation for the enduring legacy of Japan's past and the profound impact it continues to have on contemporary society.""","752"
"King L W  Leonard William ","""From the rising of the sun unto the setting of the same has Enlil granted him dominion.' It is to Enlil, the chief of the gods, that, in accordance with the practice of the period, he ascribes the dominion which has been granted him to administer. The phrases in which Lugal-zaggisi defines the limits of his empire are sufficiently striking, and it will be necessary to enquire into their exact significance. But before doing so it will be well to continue quoting from the inscription, which proceeds to describe the benefits which the king has conferred upon different cities of his realm. Referring to the peace and prosperity which characterized Lugal-zaggisi's reign, the record states that 'he caused the lands to dwell in security, he watered the land with waters of joy. In the shrines of Sumer did they set him up to be the patesi of the lands, and in be chief priest. At that time he made Erech bright with joy; like a bull he raised the head of Ur to heaven; Larsa, the beloved city of the Sun-god, he watered with waters of joy; Umraa, the beloved city of the god., he raised to exalted power; as a ewe that. her lamb, has he made Ninni-esh resplendent; the summit of Kianki has he raised to heaven.' Then follows the votive portion of the text and the prayer of dedication, with which for the moment we have no concern. From the extracts which have been quoted from Lugal-zaggisi's inscription, it will have been seen that he claims a jurisdiction far wider than might have been expected to belong to a patesi of Umma. But the text itself explains the apparent discrepancy, and shows that, while Lugal-zaggisi's inheritance was a patesiate, he won by his own exertions the empire over which he subsequently ruled. It will be noticed that while he claims for himself the titles 'King of Erech' and 'king of the land,' i.e. of Sumer, he ascribes to his father Ukush only the title 'patesi of Umma.' It is therefore clear that his father's authority did not reach beyond the limits of his native city, and we may conclude that such was the extent of the patesiate of Umma when Lugal-zaggisi himself came to the throne. The later titles, which he assumes on the vases found at Nippur, prove that at the time they were inscribed he had already established his authority throughout Sumer and had removed his seat of government from Umma to Erech. That the latter city had become his capital is clear from the precedence which he gives to the designation 'King of Erech' over his other titles of honour; and, in accordance with this change of residence, he details the new relations into which he has entered with the deities of that city. Thus he is the servant of Mes and the pupil of Ninabukhadu, the divine priest and the mistress of Erech; and in a special sense he has become the patron of Ninni, the chief seat of whose worship was at Erech, in her great temple E-anna. Ana, too, the father of the gods, had his temple in Erech, and so Lugal-zaggisi naturally became his priest and enjoyed his special favour. It was probably in consequence of Ana's close connection with his new capital that Lugal-zaggisi ascribes to him the title 'king of the lands,' which by right belonged only to Enlil of Nippur; and we may note that in the prayer of dedication on the vases it is with Ana that Enlil is besought to intercede on behalf of the king. Although Lugal-zaggisi had changed his capital and no longer continued to use his father's title as patesi of Umma, he naturally did not neglect his native city; moreover, he retained the title 'prophet of Nidaba,' and thereby continued to claim the protection of the city-goddess, who, before his recent victories, had been his patroness and that of his father before him. He even emphasized his dependence upon her by styling himself her son, and in another passage he boasts that he had raised the city of Umma to power. High in his favour also stood Ur, the city of the Moon-god, and Larsa, the city of the Sun-god; and the less-known cities of Ninni-esh and Kianki are also selected for mention as having been specially favoured by him. At first sight it is not clear on what principle the names of these cities are selected from among all those in the land of Sumer, which were presumably within the circle of his authority. That Erech, Ur, and Larsa should be referred to is natural enough, for they were close to one another, and would thus form the centre and nucleus of his dominion; and the king would naturally devote himself to improving their canalization and beautifying them by the erection of new buildings. It is not improbable that we may explain the mention of Ninni-esh and Kianki on the same principle: they probably stood in the immediate neighbourhood of the three greater cities, or of Umma, and thus participated in the benefits which they enjoyed. In any case, the absence of a city's name from Lugal-zaggisi's list is not necessarily to be taken as implying that it was not included within the limits of his dominion. This is proved by the fact that Lagash is not referred to, although it was probably one of his earliest conquests. In fact, the king's object in composing the earlier part of his inscription was not to give an accurate analysis of the extent and condition of his empire, but merely to enumerate the cities he had particularly favoured, and to record the names of those deities with whom he stood in particularly close relations. For instance, we may conclude that although the city of Eridu is not referred to by name, it nevertheless formed part of Lugal-zaggisi's kingdom. There is thus every reason to regard his dominion as having been co-extensive with the whole of Sumer, and his title 'king of the land' was probably based on a confederation of all the Sumerian city-states. A more difficult problem is presented by what at first sight appears to be a claim to a still wider empire, which follows Lugal-zaggisi's titles at the end of the first and the beginning of the second column of his inscription. He here states that, after Enlil had bestowed on him the kingdom of the Euphrates and the Tigris unto the Upper Sea.' The Lower Sea is clearly the Persian Gulf, and by the Upper Sea it is probable that the Mediterranean is intended, rather than Lake Urmi or Lake Van. On the basis of this passage Lugal-zaggisi has been credited with having consolidated and ruled an empire extending from the Persian Gulf to the shores of the Mediterranean. In other words, he would have included Akkad and Syria along with Sumer within the limits of his rule. It is true that Shar-Gani-sharri of Akkad, at a rather later period, did succeed in establishing an empire of this extent, but there are difficulties in the way of crediting Lugal-zaggisi with a like achievement. For Erech, the capital of his kingdom, was in Southern Babylonia, and, unlike the city of Akkad, was not well adapted to form the centre of an administrative area extending so far to the north and west. Moreover, the actual phrase employed by Lugal-zaggisi does not necessarily imply a claim to dominion within these regions, but may be taken as commemorating little more than a victorious raid, during which he may have penetrated to the Syrian coast. Such an expedition, so far as we know, must have marked a new departure from the policy hitherto followed by the rulers of Sumerian city-states, and its successful prosecution would have fully justified the language in which it is recorded. In view of these considerations, it is preferable to regard Lugal-zaggisi's kingdom, in the strict sense of the word, as having been confined to Sumer. Of his relations to Akkad and the northern cities we have no evidence on which to form an opinion. We shall presently see reasons for believing that at about this period, or a little later, the state of Kish secured the hegemony in Northern Babylonia, and, in view of the absence of any reference to it in Lugal-zaggisi's inscription, we may perhaps conclude that in his time the city had already laid the foundations of its later power. It was probably after his successful return from the long expedition in the north-west that Lugal-zaggisi deposited his vases as votive offerings within Enlil's shrine at Nippur, and engraved upon them the inscriptions from which we obtain our information concerning his reign. In the third column of his text he states that he has dedicated them to Enlil, after having made due offerings of loaves in Nippur and having poured out pure water as a libation. He then adds a prayer of dedication, in which he prays for life for himself, and peace for his land, and a large army. 'May Enlil, the king of the lands,' he says, 'pronounce my prayer to Ana, his beloved father! To my life may he add life! May he cause the lands to dwell in security! Warriors as numerous as the grass may he grant me in abundance! Of the celestial folds may he take care! May he look with kindness on the land (of Sumer)! May the gods not alter the good destiny they have assigned to me! May I always be the shepherd, who leads (his flock)!' We may regard it as typical of the great conqueror that he should pray for a supply of warriors 'as numerous as the grass.' It is fortunate for our knowledge of early Sumerian history that the shrine of Enlil at Nippur should have been the depository for votive offerings, brought thither by the rulers of city-states to commemorate their victories. Of the inscribed objects of this class that were recovered at Nippur during the American excavations on that site, by far the most important are the vase-fragments of Lugal-zaggisi, which have already been described.""","""Lugal-zaggisi's reign and empire.""","2165","""Lugal-zaggisi, a powerful ruler in ancient Mesopotamia, marked a significant period in the history of the region with his reign and the establishment of a vast empire. Born around the 22nd century BCE, Lugal-zaggisi ascended to the throne of the city-state of Uruk, situated in the southern part of modern-day Iraq. His rule not only transformed Uruk but also expanded its influence to create an empire that had a lasting impact on the political landscape of the time.  Lugal-zaggisi's reign was characterized by his ambition to unify and consolidate various city-states under his authority, a feat that was not commonly achieved in the tumultuous and competitive environment of ancient Mesopotamia. Through shrewd military campaigns and strategic alliances, Lugal-zaggisi managed to exert control over a significant portion of southern Mesopotamia, including key cities like Ur and Lagash. This consolidation of power laid the foundation for the emergence of the first known empire in history, setting a template for subsequent imperial endeavors.  One of the notable aspects of Lugal-zaggisi's rule was his use of religion and divine authority to legitimize his claim to power. Like many rulers of the time, he invoked the support of the gods to justify his conquests and solidify his position as a rightful sovereign. This blending of temporal and spiritual authority helped bolster his standing among his subjects and provided a framework for governance that would be emulated by later rulers in Mesopotamia and beyond.  In addition to his military and political achievements, Lugal-zaggisi also made significant contributions to the cultural and economic development of his empire. Under his rule, art, architecture, and literature flourished, with the city of Uruk becoming a center of innovation and creativity. Trade routes were expanded, allowing for the exchange of goods and ideas across the empire and beyond, fostering economic growth and cultural exchange.  Lugal-zaggisi's legacy as a ruler is also reflected in his efforts to establish a system of governance that could sustain the empire beyond his reign. He instituted administrative reforms, appointed governors to oversee various regions, and codified laws to maintain order and justice within his domains. These measures helped to centralize power and create a sense of unity among the diverse populations that comprised his empire.  Despite his many achievements, Lugal-zaggisi's reign was not without challenges. He faced opposition from rival city-states, both internally and externally, as well as periodic uprisings by disgruntled subjects. Maintaining control over such a vast territory required constant vigilance and diplomatic skill, qualities that Lugal-zaggisi demonstrated throughout his rule.  Lugal-zaggisi's empire reached its zenith during his reign, but its eventual decline was inevitable. After his death, internal strife, external invasions, and the inherent difficulties of governing a diverse and expansive empire led to its fragmentation. The legacy of Lugal-zaggisi, however, lived on in the collective memory of the peoples of Mesopotamia, who remembered him as a powerful and visionary ruler who had expanded the boundaries of their world.  In conclusion, Lugal-zaggisi's reign and empire represent a pivotal moment in the history of ancient Mesopotamia. His achievements in unifying city-states, fostering cultural and economic growth, and establishing a template for imperial governance left an indelible mark on the region. Despite the eventual decline of his empire, Lugal-zaggisi's legacy as a pioneering leader and empire-builder endures as a testament to the enduring impact of his rule on the course of history.""","725"
