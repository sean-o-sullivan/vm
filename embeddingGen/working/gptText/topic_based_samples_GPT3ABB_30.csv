"6032","""According to the Encarta Encyclopaedia environmental archaeology by definition 'examines the relationship between human societies and the natural world and takes as its point of departure the premise that environment governs human life.' It would therefore be reasonable to assume that the task of environmental study and reconstruction is an important one, as in order to understand how humans function and interact with their environment, we firstly need to know what that environment was like. The study of environmental archaeology can be split into two main categories; off site and on site. Off site consists of evidence that is gathered from natural deposits such as peat bogs, lakes, marine sediment and ice cores all of which give archaeologists evidence of long term environmental change. On site evidence comes from excavation sites, it consists of environmental remains such as plant and animal deposits, which provide local information about a particular site often giving us information about diet, from other plant and organic remains suggest a hunter gatherer community and that occupation of the site took place in winter and spring over several years. In the late Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age peat blankets formed, making land that had previously been farmed unavailable. We know that the land had previously been cultivated because the field systems can still be detected under the peat. In the Somerset levels an ancient track way known as the 'sweet track' dating c3806-807BC has been detected. Its construction has been dated to spring/autumn using Dendrochronology and analysis of pollen remains preserved in the peat. Otzi the 'Iceman' was discovered in the Austrian mountains; his body was preserved in almost perfect condition due to the immediate covering of snow and consequential freezing of his body. Dr. Klaus Oeggl has reconstructed the Iceman's last meal using microscopic analysis of a tiny from the mummy's intestine. What he discovered was einkorn, one of the few domesticated grains used in the Iceman's part of the world at this time, suggesting that he had contact with an agricultural community. The sample also contained many different varieties of pollen one being from the hop hornbeam tree, which grows in a warm environment. This told archaeologists the side of the mountain he had been travelling on and the season in which he example of a frozen burial that yielded many interesting organic finds is the Pazyrick 'ice Maiden'. Pollen is one of the most resilient organic substances; it has the capacity to last for millions of years, and is best preserved in waterlogged conditions. As such pollen analysis is the one discipline in environmental archaeology that can be applied to most excavated sites. Pollen can tell us about times of year depending on when certain plants produce their pollen; it also gives us a great deal of information about climate change. Where pollen and spores have accumulated over time, a record of the past vegetation of an area may be preserved. Changes in the vegetation of an area may be due to changes of climate, and this is made evident through the presence or absence of specific pollen species. Sediments containing fossil pollen have been taken from peat bogs, lake beds, alluvial deposits, ocean bottoms and ice cores. Environmental archaeology is also an important area to consider associated with other archaeological processes for example radio carbon dating. The levels of co2 in the atmosphere have fluctuated considerably over time due to environmental change. Therefore it is important to consider as it will affect the accuracy of our dating techniques. Archaeological reconstruction also includes a need to study the environment of a site, it enables the artist to produce an image that is more accurate by placing sites and finds in a suitable context that often makes a previously unrecognised function obvious. When introducing the topic of environmental archaeology Greene states that 'It's strength lies in the unchallengeable assumption that man, his sites and his artefacts can only be understood properly if full account is taken of their surroundings, landscape, climate, plants and animals.' It is clear then that the discipline of Environmental Archaeology is key to our understanding of archaeological sites. By putting them in context we are able to begin to understand the complex structure of human habitation. Not only that but environmental archaeology spans from the vary broad to the extremely detailed, it can tell us about differing sea levels around the world throughout the Aegean all the way to minute details such as the last meal of a Tyrolean man,00 years ago. The information we gather from the environment is invaluable in understanding the source of human life and the change and continuity of habitation throughout time.""","""Environmental archaeology and human interaction""","924","""Environmental archaeology is a branch of archaeology that focuses on studying past human interactions with the environment. By analyzing artifacts, animal bones, plant remains, and sediments, environmental archaeologists can reconstruct ancient ecosystems, understand human adaptation to environmental changes, and track how human activities have shaped landscapes over time.  One key aspect of environmental archaeology is the study of ancient diets. By analyzing plant remains, animal bones, and food residues found at archaeological sites, researchers can reconstruct the diet of past societies. This information not only sheds light on what people ate in the past but also provides insights into food production, trade networks, and culinary practices. For example, the presence of certain plant species or domesticated animals can indicate agricultural practices and dietary preferences of ancient civilizations.  Moreover, environmental archaeology plays a crucial role in understanding past climate change and its effects on human societies. By studying pollen records, tree rings, and sediments, archaeologists can reconstruct past climates and identify periods of environmental stress, such as droughts, floods, or volcanic eruptions. These environmental events often had significant impacts on ancient communities, leading to changes in settlement patterns, food production strategies, and social dynamics.  Human interaction with the environment is not limited to the exploitation of natural resources but also includes how societies managed waste and pollution. By analyzing garbage dumps, sewage systems, and industrial residues, environmental archaeologists can uncover how ancient societies disposed of waste and managed environmental pollution. This research provides valuable insights into past sanitation practices, urban planning, and resource management strategies.  Furthermore, environmental archaeology examines the long-term impacts of human activities on ecosystems. Through studying soil erosion, deforestation, and landscape modifications, researchers can trace the environmental consequences of agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization in the past. Understanding how ancient societies altered their environments can offer valuable lessons for contemporary environmental management and sustainability practices.  One fascinating aspect of environmental archaeology is the study of ancient landscapes and built environments. By using remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), researchers can uncover hidden archaeological features beneath the surface, such as ancient roads, irrigation systems, and settlements. This non-invasive approach allows archaeologists to map and analyze large-scale landscape transformations caused by human activities.  In addition to understanding how past societies interacted with their environments, environmental archaeology also sheds light on biodiversity and conservation efforts. By studying the impact of human activities on plant and animal populations in the past, researchers can assess the long-term effects of hunting, fishing, and deforestation on biodiversity. This knowledge can inform contemporary conservation strategies and help protect endangered species and ecosystems.  Overall, environmental archaeology provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between humans and the environment throughout history. By examining how past societies adapted to and transformed their surroundings, researchers can better understand the environmental challenges faced by modern civilizations. Through interdisciplinary research and collaborative efforts, environmental archaeology continues to deepen our understanding of sustainability, resilience, and conservation in the face of environmental change.""","594"
"419","""Alfonsina Storni dedicated her younger years to feminist movements. As a journalist, she strongly urged the government to grant women the vote and wrote many essays and articles on women's rights as unwed mothers, in the workforce and in education. These aspirations are immersed in her poetry where, as perceived by Rachel Phillips, she sought to 'gradually transcend her sex and circumstances and discover the human possibilities within herself'. Storni's early poetical works undoubtedly portray a greatly ambitious woman who, not only dares to challenge society's expectations of her in her choice of lifestyle, but promotes her feminist ideas to the female public in the hope that they will perceive her as an inspirational leader. Her poetry illustrates a woman who resents society's creation of polarity between men and women and is keen to dissolve this imbalance by promoting feminist awareness. I have chosen to discuss three examples of her poetry which chronologically span three of her earliest books in order to measure any change in the direction of her argument from La inquietud del rosal, published in 916, to Irremediablemente in 919. Rachel Phillips, Alfonsina Storni: From Poetess to Poet (London: Tamesis, 975/8), p.. Although it is widely agreed that Storni's earliest work, La inquietud del rosal, is stylistically weak, Sidonia Carmen Rosenbaum appreciates its success at opening 'literary doors to women in the Argentine' and admires Storni's bravery in revealing 'a spirit unafraid, undaunted by the many prejudices which the free expression of feminine sufferings, yearnings, feelings still evoked'. The inclusion of La Loba in this collection certainly displays her success at breaking out of restricting social patterns. She proudly publicises that she has 'un hijo fruto del amor, de amor sin ley', without exhibiting any fears of early twentieth-century Argentina's response to this information. Rosenbaum clarifies that 'society did not forget - or forgive' and that it was this hostility that caused Storni to suffer great solitude throughout her life (Rosenbaum, Modern Women Poets, p. 21). Her solitude can be seen to have inspired this poem, as Storni illustrates herself as an independent woman battling against her enemy, 'La vida', and enduring throughout her diversions from 'el rebano'. Sidonia Carmen Rosenbaum, Modern Women Poets of Spanish America: The Precursors (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 978), p. 10. Alfonsina Storni, La Inquietud del rosal in Obras Completas (Buenos Aires: Galerna, 993). By choosing 'la loba' to represent herself, Storni displays her support of feminism by specifically boasting an independence that unusually belongs to a woman. She convinces the reader that she is no less capable than a man in defending herself because she, too, has 'una mano / Que sabe trabajar y un cerebro que es sano'. She is confident that she does not require male protection as she is competently equipped with her own skills and intellect. She warns the 'pobrecitas y mansas ovejas del rebano' that she is prepared for battle as her 'dientes son armas de matar'. This suggests that Storni is prepared to attack any who dare to criticise the way she has chosen to live her life. She emphasises that these choices demonstrate bravery as now she must walk 'sola' throughout life with no accompanying support from society. Storni is keen to mock this society who 'laugh and point' at her who dares to depart from the tedious routine of life on the 'llano'. She seeks adventure 'a la montana' and does not envy 'las otras' who are constrained by society's expectations like a 'yugo al cuello'. She laughs to herself in response to their mockery because she can percieve that straying from the norm produces a liberty which has punctuated her life with vibrancy. While they may pity her, she is satisfied that their lives are more pitiable than her own. Unfortunately, Storni recognises that this liberty comes at a price. She acknowledges that her rebellion forces her to detach herself from a society who doesn't understand her. While this poem provides a protestation of her independance, Storni does not convince the reader that she is completely content with this unfortunate side effect of her rebellion. Tu Me Quieres Blanca displays anger towards men for replacing a woman's individual personality with an idealised invention. Storni compares the desirable woman with 'espumas' and 'nacar', whose colourlessness suggests a meaningless, chaste and harmless existence. These comparisons also attach women to nature, which supports traditional romanticised visions of femininity and symbolises the reproductive use of the female. While 'corola' and 'azucena' illustrate women as delicate and beautiful, 'espumas' attaches them to the sea, which, in conjunction with the moon, is intimately linked with the menstrual cycle. Storni is keen to disassociate herself with this image of the ordinary woman: Alfonsina Storni, El Dulce Dano in Obras Completas (Buenos Aires: Galerna, 993). Ni un rayo de luna Filtrado me haya. Ni una margarita Se diga mi hermana. While biographical information indicates that Storni did not reject her reproductive capabilities throughout her brief lifetime, she is determined not to be defined by motherhood or to be primarily employed by this occupation. She challenges images commonly attached to femininity by expressing that the flower is literally unrelated to her. She displays a desire that men perceive meaning in her existence, rather than admire her for her beauty, and emphasises that she is not a delicate creature whose fragility needs to be protected. Storni clarifies this idea in her essay entitled, 'Modern Women' where she expresses that 'in the struggle for existence there is no truce, no sex, no pity, no flowers'. The poet only perceives regression in such narrow perceptions of women. Alfonsina Storni, 'Modern Women', The Argentina Reader: History, Culture, Politics, ed. by Gabriella Nouzeilles and Graciela Montaldo (Durham; London: Duke University, 002), p. 5/87. In the fifth line of this poem, the speaker explains that, 'sobre todas', chastity is expected of her, which angers her above all else. It becomes clear that, in writing this poem, Storni particularly aims to challenge the double standards of men who expect women to be chaste and innocent, while they hypocritically feel at liberty to activate their own carnal desires. Gabriel von Munk Benton explains that, although men may feel betrayed by women, Tu Me Quieres Blanca tells 'the tragedy of the individual who is betrayed not by a human being but rather by his or her illusions, hopes, expectations'. The speaker does not use this poem to argue that she should be anything but chaste, but rather that sexually indulgent men are in no position to judge or dictate a woman's sexual activity. Therefore, she stresses that women, too, have passions and warns male partners to expect to be dealt the same fidelity, or infidelity, that he practices. While descriptions of the ideal woman simply exhaust variations of 'blanca', the male indulges in rich 'labios morados', he is 'vestido de rojo' and displays 'negros del Engano'. Storni establishes white as the colour of constraint by describing 'el esqueleto' as the only structure suppressing his immoderation. His blackness displays impure, sinful behaviour, while red indicates passion. Storni locates this image in 'los jardines', perhaps representing the Garden of Eden where the devil similarly seduced Eve, progressing to her lascivious behaviour with Adam. In celebrating Bacchus, Storni suggests that the male participates in unrestrained drunkenness and banquets indulgently on 'frutos y mieles'. These examples of his gluttony indicate his excessive sexual appetite. Gabriel von Munk Benton, 'Recurring Themes in Alfonsina Storni's Poetry', Hispania, vol. 3, no., p. 5/81. Tu Me Quieres Blanca undergoes a dramatic shift in direction as the speaker's choice of verbs progresses from 'querer' to 'pretender'. The beginning of this poem sees the repetition of 'me quieres', which emphasises the passivity of the woman who is directed by her lover's impositions. While the objectivity of the female remains in 'me pretendes', this verb suggests that, rather than demanding his ideal, the male now struggles to obtain it. The speaker begins to gain more control, displayed by the insertion of her mockingly sympathetic 'Dios te lo perdone' and the extensive list of imperatives directed at her silent listener. While she maintains her role as speaker throughout the poem, it is not until now that she displays domination. She advises men to reconnect their senses with nature: to 'habla con las pajaros', 'bebe de las rocas' and 'duerme sobre escarcha'. Having rejected the association between femininity and nature, these instructions become difficult to comprehend. Perhaps Storni asks the man to put himself in place of the woman in order to better understand her social constraints, or promotes a new relationship with his foundations in the hope that his unreasoned perception of women will be renewed. Nevertheless, her advice certainly encourages her listener to replace his fantastical imaginings with ideas grounded in reality. Storni outlines the entanglement between 'el alma' and 'las alcobas' as an error developed by men. She suggests that the separation of love from lust would improve men's treatment of women, as women would then be appreciated outside of their beauty and eroticism. Storni summarises that a man who follows all of this advice would become a 'buen hombre', but she disallows her listener to depart from her poem with such contentment. The final lines see the return of 'pretender' accompanied by a new, aggressive tone by the formation of an imperative: Pretendeme blanca, Pretendeme nvea, Pretendeme casta.Storni concludes this poem by constructing a warning to those who dare to maintain their illusions of women. Through ending with this threat, the speaker displays power over the male, creating some hope that the genders will begin to understand each other and move towards equality. Peso Ancestral documents Storni's educational journey into the lives of men and women, generations before her, in order to locate the origins of women's oppression in history. She learns that the female's capacity for emotion convinced men of their weakness. However, the poet indicates her realisation that the tears, which have now become a justification to treat women as inferior, are a product of women's painful experiences. These revelations suggest that there has never been a time when women were treated as equals with men. Storni echoes these sentiments in her essay: Alfonsina Storni, Irremediablemente in Obras Completas (Buenos Aires: Galerna, 993). Everything that has been built up in the last twenty years is crashing down with a deafening roar, its balance destroyed, its center of gravity out of kilter. (Storni, 'Modern Women', The Argentina Reader, p. 5/86). She evaluates that, since the beginning of time, efforts have been made towards a progression where men and women share a balance of power, which has never been fully achieved. Rosenbaum reminds the reader that Storni's ''fight for freedom' rather than individual is collective' (Rosenbaum, Modern Women Poets, p. 12). While this is a feature of many of her poems, the transcendence of her single voice to a plurality of voices has particular significance in this poem because an example of one woman's present experiences are deeply rooted in the lives of centuries of women before her. Storni locates disparities between the behaviour of men and women in order to target complications within their relationship at the source. This poem details a dialogue between two women: the narrator and an individual who discusses the emotional strength of her 'padre' and 'abuelo', who are adopted as male representatives. This connection reminds the reader that, while these genders can be divided by differences in behaviour and lifestyle, they are intimately related. Therefore, although women may be familiar with the 'dolor de siglos' and 'no han llorado los hombres', there is hope of a resolution in their compulsion and necessity to reproduce. Rachel Phillips discusses the effect of women's emotion on their creative output, which was commonly criticised for simply delivering 'excessive harping on sentimental themes'. However, Phillips demonstrates a feminist perspective by defending her gender in response to these critics. She asks, 'what else could the poor creatures write about?' (Rachel Phillips, Alfonsina Storni, p. ). Storni echoes this defence by emphasising that male pride is only possible because they have never tasted the 'veneno' that women have had to drink. This argument shatters the pitiable, weak image of femininity and inspires less admiration for the male of 'acero' who demonstrates his strength through a cold, unsympathetic persona. This poem demonstrates how a past has shaped the present and has the power to dictate the future if men continue to govern society. Storni appeals to women to assist her in challenging this damaging cycle of oppression, as she cannot support 'todo su peso' alone. When Storni first introduced her poetry to Argentina, her hopes could be considered to be a little naive. La Loba voices a woman who achieves the freedoms and capabilities of a man by breaking out of her social restrictions and asserting her independence. However, by the time Storni writes Tu Me Quieres Blanca, she begins to demonstrate an understanding that men are instrumental in the evolution of female independence as women, neither individually nor collectively, can achieve social acceptance without the transformation of men's perceptions of them. Peso Ancestral realises the extent of the feminist problem and appeals to women to interrupt the degrading cycle which has restricted their live for centuries and, without their support, will continue to do so.""","""Alfonsina Storni and Feminism.""","2996","""Alfonsina Storni is a prominent figure in the realm of feminist literature and a pioneer in advocating for women's rights and gender equality. Born in Switzerland in 1892 and later naturalized as an Argentine citizen, Storni's life and work continue to inspire feminists around the world. Her poetry, essays, and overall activism challenged the societal norms of her time and broke barriers for women in the arts. By delving into Storni's life and examining her contribution to feminism, we can gain a deeper appreciation for her enduring legacy and ongoing relevance in advancing gender equality.  Storni's early life was marked by hardships, which undoubtedly shaped her feminist perspective. The illegitimate daughter of an Italian-Swiss beer industrialist and a servant, she faced the stigma of her birth and the challenges of being a woman in a patriarchal society. Despite these obstacles, Storni's determination and talent propelled her to pursue a career in literature. She became a schoolteacher to support herself while immersing herself in poetry, leading to the publication of her first collection, """"La inquietud del rosal,"""" in 1916.  In her poetry, Storni explored themes of identity, love, desire, and the female experience, often challenging traditional gender roles and expectations. Her verses exude a sense of independence and self-determination, urging women to break free from societal constraints and embrace their voice and agency. Storni's work resonated with many women who felt oppressed and marginalized, providing them with a sense of empowerment and validation.  One of Storni's most famous poems, """"Tú me quieres blanca"""" (""""You Want Me White""""), starkly critiques the double standards imposed on women by society. The poem exposes the hypocrisy of a partner who demands purity and submission from his lover while engaging in promiscuous behavior himself. Storni's incisive commentary on gender dynamics and power imbalances highlights the injustices faced by women in romantic relationships and beyond. Through her poetry, she sheds light on the intricate ways in which patriarchy operates to uphold oppressive norms and diminish women's autonomy.  Beyond her poetic endeavors, Storni actively participated in feminist circles and championed women's rights through her essays and public engagements. She co-founded the Teatro del Pueblo (People's Theater) in Buenos Aires, a progressive cultural institution that showcased plays with social and political themes. Storni used her platform at the theater to address issues of gender inequality, advocating for women's suffrage and greater representation in the arts. Her commitment to gender parity and social justice was unwavering, and her contributions reverberated throughout Argentine society.  In addition to her artistic and advocacy work, Storni's personal life also reflected her feminist beliefs. She challenged conventional norms by divorcing her first husband, a decision that was controversial at the time. Storni's assertion of her right to autonomy and self-determination exemplified her commitment to living authentically and fearlessly, regardless of societal expectations. Her willingness to defy societal conventions and assert her independence paved the way for future generations of women to follow suit and demand their rights and freedoms.  Unfortunately, Storni's life was also marked by struggles with mental health issues, which eventually led her to take her own life in 1938. Her untimely death was a tragic loss for the literary world and feminist movement, cutting short a voice that had so eloquently spoken out against injustice and inequality. Nonetheless, Storni's legacy endures, as her poetry continues to inspire readers and activists alike to challenge systems of oppression and strive for a more just and equitable world.  In retrospect, Alfonsina Storni's impact on feminism cannot be overstated. Her unapologetic defiance of societal norms, her eloquent articulation of women's experiences, and her relentless advocacy for gender equality have left an indelible mark on feminist discourse. Storni's work serves as a testament to the enduring power of art in effecting social change and inspiring resistance against injustice. By celebrating her contributions and amplifying her voice, we honor not only Storni's memory but also the ongoing struggle for gender equality and women's liberation.  In conclusion, Alfonsina Storni stands as a foundational figure in feminist literature, a fierce advocate for women's rights, and a beacon of hope for those who continue to fight for gender equality. Through her poetry, activism, and personal example, she challenged the status quo, shattered stereotypes, and paved the way for future generations of feminists to follow. As we reflect on her life and work, let us remember Storni's unwavering commitment to justice and equality, and let her legacy inspire us to carry forth the torch of feminism with courage and conviction.""","970"
"311",""". -ray spectroscopy has been around since the 960s and is used in a range of applications. In 969 two satellites, called Vela A and Vela B, were launched into Earth orbit with -ray detectors intended to monitor atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. Substances that emit -rays can be injected into the body to provide radioactive tracing of such functions as blood flow, liver and kidney organs, and bone developments. In positron emission tomography an isotope is injected which emits positrons. Upon striking the normal matter inside the body two -rays are produced in opposite directions, which are detected, and used to pinpoint concentrations of blood. -ray spectra are needed to help understand high-energy processes in our universe. The energy of a -ray can tell us how the ray was created. Predicting or explaining certain -ray activity can test theories we have about the universe. Thus -ray spectroscopy is a significant area of modern physics. Electromagnetic radiation with energy greater than 00 KeV is generally referred to as -rays. However, hard X-rays can also have this high energy. The difference is that -rays are photons emitted from nuclei and X-rays are emitted from de-excitation of atomically bound electrons. -rays interact in matter by three significant and distinct processes; photoelectric absorption, Compton scattering, and pair production. Pair production occurs in the intense electric field near the protons in the nuclei of the absorbing material. The -ray disappears and an electron and positron are created. A -ray of energy greater than.2 MeV is required to create these particles. This type of interaction is seen as peak m0c2 less than the main photopeak. Compton scattering occurs between the energies greater than several hundred KeV and less than around MeV. The process involves the -ray photon scattering off an electron. The electron is given a forward knock and the photon can be scattered off in any direction. In two dimensions the interaction can be written as momentum conservation equations: Where h is Planck's constant, is original frequency, ' is the new frequency, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, P e is the momentum of the electron. Solving the equations of momentum conservation in all three dimensions gives the new -ray energy as: m0c2 is the energy of the electron at rest, and the scattering angle. The extreme where = means a head-on collision and the photon loses the most energy. This is shown on spectra as the Compton edge. It is an edge since there cannot be any Compton scattering events detected between this energy and the photopeak. The energy of this Compton edge can be found by setting = in the photons can be deflected through all angles from to 80 they can have any energy from zero up to the Compton edge. This produces a continuum on the spectrum. The original are based on the electron being free. The more likely scenario is that the electron is bound to an atom. In this case the Compton edge will not be so pronounced and will appear rounded off. The third type of -ray interaction occurs at energies up to several hundred KeV and is called photoelectric absorption. The -ray disappears as its energy is completely given to an electron. This photoelectron is freed from the atom and has the energy of the incident -ray minus the binding energy to free the electron. This binding energy is 3 KeV for the iodine K-shell and so for -rays of several hundred KeV the recoiling electron has most of the energy. As the electrons still bound to the atom rearrange, an X-ray is emitted to conserve energy. In iodine this characteristic X-ray is emitted 8% of the time. Since the photoelectron carries the energy of the incident -ray it is possible to create a spectrum of -rays by detecting the photoelectrons and measuring their energy. The oldest method of creating a spectrum is to use a scintillator to convert the -ray into visible light and then a photomultiplier to convert the photon to an electron and amplify the current to a detectable level. This signal is converted from its analogue form into a digital signal that can be interpreted by a multi-channel analyser. This set up is depicted in Figure: Scintillators can be organic or inorganic. Inorganic scintillators have impurities added called 'activators'. These activators add energy states in the band gap of the scintillator material that an excited electron can access when given energy from the -rays. The excited electron drops down to an activator ground state and releases a photon corresponding to the energy of the incident -ray. Refer to reference for a more complete description outside the scope of this introduction. The scintillator photons are chosen in the visible range, and as a photon comes in contact with a photocathode the photon's energy is transferred to an electron. This electron then migrates to the surface of the thin photocathode before escaping the surface and going into the electron multiplier. The electron multiplier is a series of dynodes. The dynode material is chosen so that upon absorbing an electron, it reemits more than one electron. This secondary electron emission yield is sensitive on the incident electron energy, and temperature. Finally the electrons are absorbed on an anode and this produces a measurable current that will be proportional to the initial -ray energy. A complete photomultiplier tube is shown in Figure: The output voltage is analogue, and is then digitised. Compared to the time taken for this digitalisation the scintillation, photoelectron emission, multiplication and detection happen quickly. Because the conversion takes longer than the measurement some measurements may be missed. The live-time is the time when the converter is observing the detector for peak voltages and not doing conversions. The difference between the actual time taken for the readings and the live-time as called the dead-time. The multichannel analyser does this conversion and stores the digital data. They can also perform such functions as adjust the gain, shaping time, pile-up rejection and spectrum stabilisation. These, and other facets of MCAs, are discussed in more detail in reference. The end effect is that the MCA can display a spectrum of energies of the -rays and their respective count rates. A typical spectrum is shown in Figure: The X-ray peak in Figure is caused by the -rays striking material around the detector and through photoelectric absorption an X-ray is given off and detected. For example, -rays that strike the lead shielding of the detector produces 4.6 KeV lead X-rays. Backscatter peaks occur around. MeV and are caused by -rays that have been Compton scattered off materials surrounding the detector. Annihilation peaks are from pair the material surrounding the detector and thus occur at.11 MeV. The Compton edge, which theoretically should be a sharp edge, is rounded due to bound electrons having a spread of energies as well as the resolution of the detector. Multiple Compton events are caused by Compton scattering occurring outside the scintillator crystal, such as scattering off the table. The resolution of the detector is defined to be the full-width at half- the photopeak divided by the central energy of peak, the FWHM is shown in Figure. This is related to the relative detector efficiency by the peak-to-total ratio. The counts under the photopeak divided by the total counts detected gives the detector efficiency. The Compton continuum hence decreases detector efficiency. The probability that a nucleus in a sample will decay and emit a -ray is small and constant for a single nucleus. With many nuclei together the emission is independent, and if the half-life is much greater than the observation time, the emission will be constant too. Because the decay events are independent, random, and spontaneous the Poisson distribution can model the nuclear decay statistics. A binomial distribution would match too, as decay is a constant probability event during the short observation times relative to the half-life, but due to the large numbers of nuclei it is 'computationally cumbersome.' the equation for the Poisson distribution: gives the predicted probability of measuring exactly x counts given that the mean is. The predicted variance is equal to this mean, and the predicted standard deviation is equal to the square root of this mean: relation is a satisfactory test for the Poisson distribution. The aims of this experiment are to appreciate the statistical nature of the radioactive decay process and verify that radioactive is governed by Poisson statistics. During this the aim is to learn how to collect and interpret -ray spectra, to understand the practical difficulties involved in obtaining -ray spectra and in particular the effects introduced by the detector. Obtaining the -ray spectrum for a known source and explaining all the features contained in the data will objectify this. Identifying unknown -ray sources from their spectra will be performed along with an investigation of the energy dependence of -ray attenuation coefficients of lead, which will involve the measuring of the -ray attenuation of lead.. Experimental Details: CalibrationCalibration relates the channel numbers of the multichannel analyser with actual energies. Without calibration the real energies of the -rays would be unknown. However ratios such as detector efficiency would still be the same. The equipment used to detect -rays in this experiment is of the same kind as describes in Figure. The microprocessor is in a PC and scintillator is sodium-iodide crystal doped with the spectrum reset. Then another 0 seconds of live-time recording made for the same region of interest. In total, sixty independent measurements were made. If the Poisson distribution given in valid, the conditions in be true, that is the variance must be approximately equal to the mean value. The variance can be calculated by the following equation: in this case, x represents the counts..b Poisson Statistics: ResultsThe counts for the sixty measurements are given below in ascending order: The mean of these results is ~34,91. The square of the mean is 8,95/8,05/8,43. The mean of the squares is 8,95/8,5/87,33. The difference in these latter two values is 5/81,90. This is equal to the variance of the sample, given by N is number of independent measurements. In this case the error is 7..c Poisson Statistics: DiscussionAs radioactivity obeys the Poisson distribution given in objective of verifying this has been achieved. Because the distribution is Poisson it shows that, statistically at least, over the timescales observed that the decay of nuclei is random. A disadvantage of this method of testing is that it takes time to get a significant number of independent measurements recorded. This is offset by the simplicity of verifying the distribution once the data has been collected and the photopeak integral automatically calculated. Because of the long timescale involved in taking all the measurements the temperature in the laboratory changed, and this caused the photopeak to wander off centre from the region of interest. If the photopeak went too far to either side then significant counts would be lost. This calibration issue was taken into account by setting the region of interest a good distance either side of the photopeak, without capturing any other peaks or Compton phenomena that could add systematic error to the results. This is an acceptable practice as it is only the count number that is important, and not the actual energy of the photopeak. Besides the systematic error by detecting photons not belonging to the photopeak, the other error is the statistical one shown in a count rate of 663 counts per second. The energy of the Compton edge can be calculated using the rest mass energy of an electron, the Compton edge is found to be at: Similarly, also be used to find the location of the backscatter peak, which in this case is equal to around..c Spectrum and Detector Characteristics: DiscussionObtaining a good -ray spectrum was practically difficult in that it is hard to achieve the ideal theoretical model. The detector has a finite resolution, and the MCA has dead-time where measurements are being neglected. There are other materials around the detector that the -rays scatter off causing multiple Compton events, backscatter and X-ray peaks. Nonetheless a -ray spectrum was obtained and all the features contained in the data were explained. Some information about the detector was calculated, and it can be seen that the detector was not very efficient. Semiconductor diode detectors can improve the efficiency and resolution but have other drawbacks. The Compton edge is where it is theoretically predicted to be, but is rounded off and slightly spread out. This is a factor of bound electrons and finite resolution. The backscatter peak is located more around 00 KeV, slightly higher than calculated but still within theoretical bounds which state the backscatter peak always occurs at an energy of 5/80 KeV or less. The resolution of the detector is affected by a variety of contributions such as electronic noise, variations in scintillator response from impurities, and the photomultiplier tube gain from event to event. The temperature change of the photomultiplier tube can have a large affect on the resolution also. Because the spectrum was taken immediately after a calibration the temperature change was not great enough to affect the results significantly. It would be good to have higher energy -ray sources so the detection of annihilation peaks would be possible. If safely possible an investigation of the Cherenkov effect or Bremsstrahlung radiation might be useful in completing the objectives of this experiment..a Emission Spectroscopy: DetailsThe apparatus was calibrated with the known sources as before. An unknown source was placed in the detector and its spectrum recorded and saved. Calibration was again performed and experiment repeated with another unknown source. The data was collected until there was sufficiently high signal-to-noise for the conclusions drawn to be firm. The features on the spectra were labelled. The photopeaks were matched up with the expected energies of sources given in a data table and through a process of elimination the unknown sources were identified..b Emission Spectroscopy: ResultsFigures and show the spectra for the two unknowns. Unknown A was determined to be sodium-2, which has a half-life of.0 years and photopeaks at.11 MeV and.75/8 MeV. These correlate with the measured photopeaks at and. The data book gave that 9.5/8% of the photons were emitted at these energies, which fits with Figure. Unknown B was determined to be cobalt-0, which has a half-life of.7 years and photopeaks at.73 MeV and.33 MeV. These correlate with the measured photopeaks at and. The data book gave that 9.% of the photons were emitted at these energies, which fits with Figure. Both unknowns have typical spectra that have been labelled accordingly. However, there is a spurious peak at in Figure. There is reasonable accuracy in the deduction of sources as all the photopeaks match within the errors allowed, the photon emission fits with the graphs, and the half-lives are long enough that is it likely they would be used in a laboratory experiment..c Emission Spectroscopy: DiscussionThe spurious peak in Figure could possibly due to pair production, although this method of interaction is usually noted for sources with photopeaks at higher energies, such at > MeV. The spurious peak is at too higher an energy to be a backscatter peak, and too far away from the photopeaks to be a Compton edge. It is most likely, therefore, that this peak is a small photopeak. It is suspected it was caused by the unknown A source still in the vicinity. Identifying unknown -ray sources from their spectra was a primary objective in this experiment and it was met successfully. The labelling of the spectra further added to the objectives undertaken in part. to collect -ray spectra and explain their features. Limitations of only being able to deduce the isotopes listed in the data book might cause a problem if this experiment was applied elsewhere. Also the unknown sources were effectively pure; it would be considerably harder if the unknowns contained a mixture of radioactive isotopes. -ray spectroscopy is very useful for identifying unknown sources by measuring their spectra. It is conceivable that the MCA is combined with a database of isotope data and the process of detection could be automated. Due to only testing the sources once straight after a calibration they are very accurate which aided the identification. Thus temperature changes provided no noticeable systematic error. The errors are from the detector and other sources nearby adding unwanted photopeaks. A method to stop this latter error creation would be to shield the detector completely, or take a 'background' count with no source in the detector and subtract it from measured spectrum..a Absorption Spectroscopy: DetailsIf between the source and the detector the -rays are allowed to pass through an absorber of variable thickness then the attenuation with be exponential. This linear attenuation coefficient is given as: I is the flux measured, I0 the flux without an absorber, the attenuation coefficient and t the thickness. However, this is for a collimated beam of -rays. The scenario will most likely be one with bad geometry, where the detector can respond to -rays that have been scattered by the absorber, as shown below in Figure: This would cause the measured counts appear larger than if the beam was collimated, and is called 'Buildup'. The equipment was calibrated and a 37Cs isotope placed into the apparatus, but not near the detector. This kept the distance of the source and detector constant throughout the experiment, as the divergent beam of -rays would be affect by the inverse square law. The flux was counted between energies of 91. KeV and 30. KeV for sixty seconds live-time without an absorber. This method was applied several more times with various thicknesses of absorbers between the source and detector. The absorbers were all square bits lead, and the thickness was measured with a micrometer on all four sides and averaged..b Absorption Spectroscopy: ResultsTable shows that the /, the mass attenuation coefficient, is calculated to be.14 m kg - for lead. The expected value for the 61 KeV photopeak is around.11 m kg -. The errors in the counts are related to the Poisson errors. The percentage error in the counts should be combined in a quadrature sum to find the percentage error in. Dividing by the thickness to determine adds in another quadrature sum error..c Absorption Spectroscopy: DiscussionThe aim to measure the -ray attenuation of lead was successful, although the error was not calculated. The expected value is lower than the measured value for the energy of the photopeak in this case. This is expected, as the energy range of the photopeak is where the Compton scattering attenuation mechanism is most prevalent. Thus the bad geometry of the set up yielded more detected counts than would be possible with a collimated beam due to these extra scattering events. An advantage of this method is that it depends only on the ratio of initial flux and absorbed flux, so it will work with any source regardless of its actual activity. The bad geometry means that the value obtained for the mass attenuation coefficient is unreliable. Improvements could be made to place the source down a heavily shielded tube to give it a collimated beam. Since -rays are such high energies they interact with matter more strongly than visible light photons and as such lens cannot be used to 'focus' the beam. The time over which the readings were taken could have allowed the calibration to drift due to thermal changes, but there were no systematic errors introduced by this, as the temperature was stable.""","""Gamma-ray spectroscopy and measurements.""","4011","""Gamma-ray spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used in various fields such as nuclear physics, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging. It involves the detection and analysis of gamma rays emitted by atomic nuclei during radioactive decay processes. By studying the energy levels and intensities of gamma rays, scientists can gain valuable insights into the structure of atomic nuclei, identify radioactive isotopes, and measure radiation levels accurately.  At the heart of gamma-ray spectroscopy is the gamma-ray spectrometer, a device designed to detect, measure, and analyze gamma rays. These spectrometers utilize scintillation crystals, semiconductor detectors, or gas-filled detectors to convert incoming gamma rays into electrical signals that can be processed and analyzed. The key components of a gamma-ray spectrometer include the detector, preamplifier, amplifier, analog-to-digital converter, and data acquisition system.  Scintillation detectors are commonly used in gamma-ray spectroscopy due to their high sensitivity and energy resolution. These detectors consist of scintillation crystals such as sodium iodide (NaI) or lanthanum bromide (LaBr3) that emit light when struck by gamma rays. The emitted light is converted into electrical signals by photomultiplier tubes, which amplify the signal for further analysis. Semiconductor detectors, like high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, offer superior energy resolution but are more costly and require cooling to liquid nitrogen temperatures.  Gas-filled detectors, such as proportional counters and Geiger-Muller tubes, are simple and cost-effective detectors used for gamma-ray spectroscopy in environments where high sensitivity is not critical. While they offer lower energy resolution compared to scintillation and semiconductor detectors, gas-filled detectors are widely used in radiation monitoring applications due to their ease of use and portability.  The energy spectrum obtained from a gamma-ray spectrometer provides valuable information about the source of radiation and its radioactive decay processes. Each gamma-ray emission is characterized by its energy level, which is specific to the nuclide emitting the gamma ray. By analyzing the energy spectrum, scientists can identify the radioactive isotopes present, quantify their activity levels, and determine the nature of the radiation source.  One of the key parameters analyzed in gamma-ray spectroscopy is the full width at half maximum (FWHM), which represents the energy resolution of the detector system. A narrow FWHM indicates high energy resolution, allowing for the accurate identification of gamma-ray energies and better discrimination between closely spaced peaks in the energy spectrum. Energy calibration is essential in gamma-ray spectroscopy to accurately assign energy values to detected gamma rays and ensure the reliability of the measurements.  In practical applications, gamma-ray spectroscopy is used for a wide range of purposes, including environmental monitoring, nuclear medicine, and planetary exploration. In environmental monitoring, gamma-ray spectroscopy is employed to detect radioactive contaminants in soil, water, and air, allowing for the assessment of environmental impact and the implementation of remediation measures. In nuclear medicine, gamma-ray spectroscopy plays a vital role in diagnostic imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), enabling physicians to visualize internal organs and diagnose medical conditions.  Furthermore, gamma-ray spectroscopy is utilized in geology and planetary science to analyze the composition of rocks, minerals, and planetary surfaces. By measuring the gamma-ray emissions from natural radioactive isotopes such as potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232, scientists can infer the geological history and chemical composition of terrestrial and extraterrestrial materials. Gamma-ray spectroscopy has been instrumental in space missions such as the Mars rovers, where gamma-ray spectrometers have provided valuable data on the elemental composition of the Martian surface.  Overall, gamma-ray spectroscopy is a versatile and indispensable tool for the analysis of gamma-ray emissions from radioactive sources. Through advanced detector technologies and data analysis techniques, scientists can extract valuable information about the nature of radioactive decay processes, the identification of isotopes, and the measurement of radiation levels with high precision and accuracy. As technology continues to evolve, gamma-ray spectroscopy will remain at the forefront of nuclear and radiation science, serving as a cornerstone for research, industry, and healthcare applications.""","836"
"430",""".The impact of depreciation in real exchange on trade balance has been a long standing debate in policy circles. Proponents of the international monetarist approach argue that real devaluation of currency raises the price of traded good relative to non-traded goods leading to fewer imports while, ceteris paribus, exports become more competitive resulting in an overall improvement in trade balance. Proponents of the absorption approach such that 'devaluation may change terms of trade, increase production, and switch production from foreign to domestic goods, thus improving the trade balance' (Bahmani-Oskooee 984). Channels through which devaluation can negatively affect the trade balance are discussed the long-term effect of devaluation to be negative in the case of India, Greece, and Korea; and positive in the case of Thailand. The U.S. trade balance deteriorated in 972 after a devaluation of the dollar in 971. (Upadgyaya, Dhakal 997) find that though devaluation improved trade balance for Colombia, Mexico and Thailand, the effect was statistically significant only for Mexico. For Cyprus, Greece and Morocco, devaluation had a statistically significant negative effect on trade balance. (Himarios Jan 989), in his extensive study, finds a positive effect of devaluation on trade balance in over 0% of the cases studied. He also finds a J-curve for short-term deterioration in trade balance as being caused by domination of current account by goods already in transit, existing contracts and the like. (Junz, Rodolf 973) attribute lagged improved of trade balance in response to devaluation of real exchange rate to five factors - recognition, decision, delivery, replacement and production. Their empirical evidence supports lags of up to five years. This study focuses on India. India's closed economy approach precipitated a macroeconomic crisis in 991 which led a paradigm shift in macro-policies. Pre-991, India followed a largely socialist approach involving restrictions on industry, international trade, currency movements, financial and banking sector and private enterprise. Growth in the 980s was fuelled largely by expansionary fiscal policies resulting in a balance of payments crisis in 991. Following the crisis, India undertook a complete overhaul of its macroeconomic policies along more liberal and capitalist lines. The economy was opened up, freer trade was allowed, the over-valued exchange rate was allowed to depreciate both in nominal and real terms, policies to improve public finance were implemented, and fetters to the operation of private enterprise were slowly removed. In short, India's economy faced a radically different set of policies which led to improved economic performance - increased GDP growth rate to over %, increased capital formation, higher savings, etc. As a consequence of the change in policies, a priori, a change or shift in trend of trade balance is expected. In this paper, we shall focus on the long-run relationship between trade and real exchange rate and proceed as follows: Section II will present the econometric model and data description. Section III contains the econometric procedures carried out, summary of results, explanation of the process and econometric interpretation of the results were relevant. Section IV presents the econometric results of Section III in a cohesive fashion and links them to the economic theory discussed in Section I. Section V discusses the limitations and possible extensions of the model Section VI - conclusion. Data and Econometric ModelIn econometric modelling, the ideas followed without the monetary flavour of their model. Further, a quadratic trend and a dummy for potential structural break are included in our model to arrive at the following long-run relationships: where is the OLS residual. Our sample includes 5/85/8 quarterly observations from 968Q1 to 006Q3. The explanatory variables, collected from International Financial generated trends/dummies, are as follows: Nominal Exchange Consumer Price Wholesale Price Trend from base year of Trend from base year of for the above data, real trade balance and real exchange rate were computed as follows:. Methodology and Estimation3. Diagnostic Tests and Estimation MethodPrior to using an estimator, it is important to verify that the relevant assumptions underlying the estimator hold in our model. This section discusses OLS assumptions and the tests used to validate them. In subsequent sections, we will only briefly report the results of these tests to avoid repetition: Jarque-Bera and Asymptotic Normality: Normally distributed residuals are an important requirement for OLS since, then, estimated co-efficients, being linear combinations of the residuals, are also normally distributed. If the distribution of the estimates is known, hypothesis testing is possible by comparison with the standard normal tables. If the null of normality is rejected, hypothesis testing may not be accurate. ADP/PP Test and Stationarity: We use ADF/PP to test for order of integration and, proceed to use of cointegration techniques. Zero Conditional Mean and No Perfect Collinearity: Covariance between explanatory variables and residuals should be zero. Results are not reported in the output, but the covariance matrix, where appropriate, has been checked and no violation of this assumption was found. On checking correlation between explanatory variables, we found no perfect collinearity. White's Test and Homoscedasticity: OLS assumes that the variance of the disturbances is constant over time; i.e. homoscedastic. Under heteroscedasticity, OLS estimates are unbiased but not precise due to changing variance of the residuals. Thus, the standard errors used to compute t-statistics may be incorrect leading to invalid t-statistics and therefore incorrect inference of significance and tests of restrictions. White's used to detect the presence of heteroscedasticity. We follow the 'no cross terms' form of the test due to sample-size, in the presence of heteroscedasticity of unknown form, give us consistent standard valid tests of restrictions/significance. Durbin-Watson/Breusch-Godfreyand Serial Correlation: OLS is BLUE under the assumption of 'no serial correlation' in residuals. The Breusch-Godfrey test has the null of no serial correlation and a Durbin-Watson stat around.0 indicates no serial correlation. Weak Dependence: (Wooldridge 003) defines variable X as weakly dependent if X t and X t+h are 'almost independent' as h increases without bound. This property is verified from the correlograms of REER and BAL. We use Ramsey RESET where a rejection of the null indicates incorrect functional form, specification error or omitted variables.. StationarityOrder of integration refers to the number of times a variable has to be differenced to achieve stationarity. We explore the correlograms, in levels and first difference, of BAL and REER, with 0 lags. Inspection of the correlograms for BAL and REER indicate that both variables suffer from statistically significant auto-correlation in levels. The first differences of both variables show statistically significant absence of auto-correlation as indicated by the p-values. This suggests that both series are not stationary and ergodic. We test for our data - REER and BAL - using the Augmented Dickey- the Phillips--statistics along with MacKinnon's critical values since standard asymptotic theory does not work. We have used the SIC/AIC criteria for determination of lag length for unit roots. Correlograms and test output presented in Appendices IA and IB. Null of unit root rejected at % level of significance. All level tests conducted with a trend and intercept. In the case of first difference of variables, only an intercept was included.. Engle-Granger MethodologyEconomic theory predicts a long-run REER and BAL. We use Engle-Granger is suitable when one cointegrating relationship is expected. For use of this technique, the regression equation has to be balanced in the time series property of the variables; i.e., it is required that all variables be integrated to the same order - our case. If there exists a cointegrating relationship between the two variables, the residuals obtained from the long-run be stationary - in Table that LIB is insignificant, we cannot reject the null hypothesis on econometric grounds since the t-statistics are invalid and hypothesis testing is not possible. Moreover, the residuals from this regression are stationary, i.e. both the ADF and the PP tests that our residuals are stationary implying that we have a valid long-run equilibrium. Error Correction Model and its interpretationThe second step of the Engle-Granger methodology involves the estimation of an Error Correction and a stationary residual from the static regression. The time trends, being exogenous, need not be included in the ECM. Thus, after running standard diagnostic tests, we can interpret the t-statistics in the ECM. In consonance with economic theory discussed, our initial ECM includes 2 lags of both the dependent and the independent variable since it is reasonable to expect elasticity of trade balance to real exchange rate to adjust slowly over a horizon of up to years as it involves structural changes, renegotiation of contracts, etc. (Junz, Rodolf May 973). We test for heteroscedasticity, normality, serial correlation and omitted variable bias. The results are presented in Table statistically significant between and -. This has the important implication that each period, the equilibrium error is corrected and the system is not explosive. We drop the insignificant arrive at the restricted/parsimonious % level of significance, we can infer the following about the restricted and the unrestricted ECM: Breusch-Godfrey and Durbin-Watson: No serial correlation.Jarque-Bera: Normality in residuals.Ramset RESET: The restricted ECM rejects the null with the F but fails to reject it with the Chi so we have a borderline case; but, for the sake of consistency, and because it is a borderline case, we do not modify the specification. White: Heteroscedasticity.F-statistic: Null of all coefficients being statistically zero rejected.In both the restricted and the unrestricted version of the ECM, all the assumptions underlying OLS with time series are satisfied as is evident from the discussion in Section. and the results of diagnostic tests presented in Tables IV and VI. We interpret only the restricted ECM. The co-efficient of residual from the static negative as expected. This implies that some equilibrium error at t- was removed in period t and that our system will remain in equilibrium and not explode. In addition, when we tested for Auto-regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity using the ARCH LM. Results and InterpretationOur long-run equilibrium relationship from Engle- the Dynamic General-to- is as follows: The focus of this paper is on the impact of real exchange rate devaluation on trade balance. There is a difference of.7 in the coefficient of REER between the two approaches. The coefficients of the trend variables also differ in magnitude. Even though the difference in magnitude exists, it must be kept in mind that they are small in comparison to empirical changes observable in the variables - REER, T, T2 - and do not have a qualitatively negative impact on our study. Having considered the magnitudes, it is crucial that both methods of arriving at the long-run equilibrium give us the same signs on each variable. This is true of our long-run equilibrium estimates. Thus, using both approaches, we conclude that an increase in REER causes an increase in. Extensions and LimitationsAt each stage of estimation, we detected. Owing to methodological limitations, we could not specify the model to take into account these effects. Furthermore, OLS may no longer be the optimal estimator in the presence of ARCH effects when compared with non-linear estimators such as the maximum likelihood estimator. Further work on the model developed should take ARCH into account. Though we get economically sensible relationships from both EGM and dynamic General-to-Specific models, we have different values for the intercept and co-efficients of real exchange rate and linear time trend. Furthermore, owing to constraints on the length of the project, we have focussed only on the long-run equilibrium. It would be interesting exercise to model the short-term dynamics and test for the presence of a 'J-curve'. A structural break was expected in the model around 990-1 when India underwent a macroeconomic crisis. Though the dummy used in the model to capture this rejected as insignificant on the basis of valid statistical criterion in Section., one would expect, guided by economics, the paradigm shift in policy to cause a structural break. Chow Breakpoint Test and insignificance in the dynamic general-to-specific regression.. ConclusionWe find, in the case of India, that devaluation improves trade balance. Our results contradict those finds that real devaluation worsens the trade balance for India in the long-run. This conflict might be due to the face that we have used co-integration technique for non-stationary variables while (Bahmani-Oskooee 984), being an old study, makes no use cointegration. The results of this study lend themselves to policy prescriptions suggesting devaluation as a measure to improve trade balance. One must, however, approach the result with caution. Even though devaluation might improve the trade balance, it is important for a developing country like India to analyse its trade baskets and the impact devaluation would have on it. Such an analysis is important before devaluation is used as a policy tool since it could have negative long-run effects on growth if it adversely affects basic industrial inputs and causes other perverse distortions in the basic input-output matrix. Therefore, a detailed study of the components of the basket of traded goods is recommended if devaluation is pursued as a policy tool.""","""Real exchange rate and trade balance""","2774","""The real exchange rate and trade balance are two critical concepts in the field of economics that play a significant role in understanding a country's economic performance in the global marketplace. Both of these factors are interconnected and have a direct impact on a nation's trade relationships, competitiveness, and overall economic well-being.  Let's first delve into the real exchange rate. The real exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency can be exchanged for another country's currency after adjusting for inflation. It is essentially the relative price of goods and services between two countries, taking into account changes in price levels. Unlike the nominal exchange rate, which is the straightforward exchange rate between two currencies, the real exchange rate provides a more accurate representation of a country's purchasing power with respect to foreign goods.  The real exchange rate is a crucial indicator of a country's international competitiveness. A strong real exchange rate implies that a country's goods and services are relatively more expensive compared to its trading partners. This can make exports more expensive for foreign buyers and imports cheaper for domestic consumers, potentially leading to a trade imbalance. On the other hand, a weak real exchange rate can boost a country's export competitiveness by making its goods cheaper for foreign buyers, thereby potentially improving the trade balance.  Now, let's shift our focus to the trade balance, which is the difference between the value of a country's exports and imports of goods and services. A positive trade balance, also known as a trade surplus, occurs when exports exceed imports, indicating that a country is exporting more than it is importing. Conversely, a negative trade balance, or a trade deficit, occurs when imports exceed exports, signifying that a country is consuming more than it is producing.  The trade balance is influenced by various factors, with the real exchange rate playing a significant role. A strong real exchange rate can lead to a trade deficit by making exports more expensive and imports cheaper, as mentioned earlier. This can result in increased imports of foreign goods and decreased competitiveness of domestic products in international markets. Conversely, a weak real exchange rate can help improve the trade balance by making exports more competitive and imports relatively more expensive, thereby boosting domestic production and reducing reliance on foreign goods.  It is important to note that while the real exchange rate and trade balance are interconnected, they are also influenced by a myriad of other factors such as government policies, global economic conditions, productivity levels, and consumer preferences. Countries often use various strategies to manage their real exchange rates and trade balances, including monetary and fiscal policies, trade agreements, and exchange rate interventions to achieve economic stability and competitiveness in the international arena.  In conclusion, the real exchange rate and trade balance are essential components of a country's economy that reflect its competitiveness, trade relationships, and overall economic health. Understanding the interplay between these factors is crucial for policymakers, economists, businesses, and investors in making informed decisions to promote sustainable economic growth and prosperity. By monitoring and managing the real exchange rate and trade balance effectively, countries can strive to achieve a balance between domestic production, international trade, and economic stability in an increasingly interconnected global economy.""","618"
"3003","""Michel Foucault's essay 'What is an Author?' has had a massive impact upon how people view the idea of authorship and authority. Foucault claimed that the traditional view of the author was simply a modern construction seeking to exalt the author to an omniscient position. However, he felt that in reality the author has no authority over their text, as the reader cannot know the author and therefore cannot interpret the author's intentions. Moreover, he felt it was unnecessary to know the author's intention; what was more important was for the reader to be able to bring their own meaning and interpretation from the text for their own use. Other Postmodern thinkers have taken this idea further, treating the world as a text and the individuals habiting the world as the readers. The individual has no clear authority or standards by which to interpret the world and is consequently left to discover 'truth' for themselves, and to live in a way which best serves themselves and their needs. Sigmund Freud thought that in view of death, the central motivation for the individual in life was the feeling of desire and pleasure. In addition, Jacques Lacan said that at the core of human identity is a sense of lack, knowledge that we will never be fulfilled, therefore desire is not the product of the search but the point of it; the individual desires desire. The Modern subject, in light of the death of God and religion, searched for reason and truth, believing they could be found in science, philosophy and in the benevolence of mankind. The Postmodern individual, unconvinced by the reality of altruistic humanism, became fluid, hybrid and fragmented. At the heart of Postmodern subjectivity is the need to define oneself against the 'other'; the need to find self fulfilment and realisation. French in Jewish parents, founder of and intellectual, born in Paris, and Postmodern thought derives from the idea that religion is dead, and in view of human death being the end of the philosophies for the present age. It is interesting that much of this thought is also taught in the Bible, the book which Postmodern thinkers see as ancient and transient. The writer of Ecclesiastes claims that life under the in fact meaningless and impossible to understand. The pursuit of pleasure brings no satisfaction, we do not know what will happen when we die and yet we feel and desire to live. The apostle Paul writes to the church in Corinth that if death is the end and there is no resurrection then 'Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die'. Although both the Biblical writers are arguing that in fact death is not the end, they can see that if it is, then they are in agreement with Freud, Lacan and Foucault that all that is left is instant gratification, desire and self-fulfilment. The subject must find their identity in a fragmented world. The exploration of identity through storytelling and the effects of truth upon identity are the themes of continuity that I will look at in Joseph Conrad's modern novella Heart of Alan Warner's contemporary novel Morvern Callar. the 'Teacher' could refer to King Solomon, or the writings are at least royal teachings in Solomonic tradition, written no later then th century BC, see p.09 in New Bible Ecclesiastes:4 from the Holy Ecclesiastes:0-1 see Ecclesiastes:9b-1 see Ecclesiastes:1 see Corinthians 5/8:2 Polish sailor and novelist. (85/87-924) Warner was born in Argyll in 964 Heart of Darkness is Conrad's novella about the journey of a western seaman, Marlow, and his search into Africa for the explorer Kurtz. Marlow's physical journey is reflective of his psychological journey for truth and meaning that he hopes Kurtz might bring him. The novella is written from the narrator who is listening to Marlow telling his story to a group of men. Marlow is portrayed as a thoughtful, insightful, meditative would be the result of attempting to understand an 'incomprehensible world' (p.0). The white man was viewed as a god-like figure, a civilized being. Yet when Marlow arrives in Belgium, the western city reminds him of a Kurtz is in Africa a reference to Matthew 3:7- He has given up hope of finding any meaning in the west, cautious of the noble idea of the civilizing mission and sceptical of his aunt's view of him as an apostolic 'emissary of light' (p.8). Conrad describes Marlow's journey as one into hell, as the women in the waiting room to see the doctor guard 'the door of darkness' (p.6). He is aware of the dangers of the psychological impact of his journey, he feels he is becoming 'scientifically interesting' (p.0) and he had been warned before by the doctor that 'the changes take place inside' (p.7). Marlow struggles to narrate his story, despairing at his 'impossible' (p.0) task, unable to become more than a silent voice in the pitch dark. Marlow realises his need to find understanding and although he recognises his own limitations of expression, he believes that he can find this wisdom in Kurtz. Kurtz is portrayed as an enigmatic god-like figure, the man who has become an idol for the local peoples and an inspiration for all those who hear of him. Marlow's greatest fear is that he will 'Never hear him' (p.9). He has not been thinking about meeting or seeing him, but hearing him. For Kurtz has, 'The gift of expression, the bewildering, the illuminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the pulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable darkness.' (p.9)The image of Kurtz here is of a deity; he has a voice, which the Bible describes is the which God effects his power in creation, revelation and bringing life. Kurtz is being specifically compared here to Jesus; he has a voice that Marlow believes is able to enlighten the darkness of the world. As Marlow does not have the expression that brings understanding, it becomes his destiny, or pilgrimage, to hear Kurtz. see Psalm 3: Jesus the word incarnate, bringing light into darkness, see John:-, 4,:2, 2:6 see John: The Russian, who Marlow meets before he encounters Kurtz, tells him that 'You don't talk with that man - you listen to him' (p.8). Although he claims that Kurtz has indeed 'enlarged my mind' (p.0) there is a hint that the result of hearing him has indeed left him still without hope or understanding. 'He waved his arm, and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost depths of despondency' (p.8). This phrase is a biblical reference to the final triumph of the resurrection, the moment when all hope and joy in life is fulfilled but Conrad associates it with an epiphany of despair, a fall to utter hopelessness. Marlow continues to have faith in his meeting with Kurtz, but as his journey evolves and he finds out more about his methods he becomes increasingly distressed and antipathetic towards him. The anti-climax that the Russian's despondency predicts comes true in Kurtz's final revelation before he dies. As he lies in the despair of darkness, he experiences a 'supreme moment of complete knowledge' (p.12), his last words, the hope that Marlow has, are 'The Horror! The Horror!' (p.12) The god-figure is dead, the voice is gone and his revelation is ambiguous and at best a bleak summary of the world that he has left behind. The discovery that their shared fate is simply oblivion is the 'appalling face of glimpsed truth' (p.13) that Marlow discovers which maligns his belief in humanity and mankind. see Corinthians 5/8:2 The loss of the voice, the narrator and the author at the end of Heart of Darkness destabilises the framework of Marlow's mind and his outlook on society. When he returns to Europe he views people's lives as meaningless, filled with 'insignificant and silly dreams' (p.14). Foucault predicts this effect when he sees the death of the author. The loss of the central and authoritative figure creates disharmony and instability leaving the reader with no answers and no centre. The centre or the 'heart' is no longer knowable, but in fact filled with darkness. When there is no longer the god-like figure, the self becomes fragmented and unsure of anything, death is the only common fate and life must be understood subjectively. At the end of the novella we see that in effect, Marlow has been searching for something that was not actually there. Lacan's theory is relevant here because although the point of his search is intangible, he would say that he has been searching for desire. He is fulfilled in the sense that although from the beginning an answer was never there, in his journey he has desired it, and filled his sense of lack. Alan Warner's existential novel Morvern Callar begins when the main protagonist Morvern finds her boyfriend having committed suicide and examines the issues of the morality of her reaction in a seemingly valueless and hedonistic society. The novel begins where Heart of Darkness finishes; with the death of the author, the creator and God. Morvern's boyfriend remains nameless but is referred to with the divine capital 'Him' (p.). He is the author who has written a novel which he leaves with Morvern and he is the creator of the model village of their town which is in the loft of their apartment, where his divine body lies. The reader never hears his voice; his life and death are left in Morvern's hands, and he becomes her story. Morvern is an orphan, unaware of her biological parents and born into a vacuum, with no grounding, stability or history. She keeps her boyfriend's death a secret and then claims authorship of his work. Throughout the novel, there is a clear emphasis on the narrative voice; in the Mantrap, Lanna and Tequila Shiela recall their ex-boyfriend stories, at the Kale Onion Hotel the main event is Panatine's 'finger' story and Couris Jean is keen to reminisce with Morvern about her arrival at the port. All the characters exist and find their identity in storytelling, a discourse which gives them order, meaning and coherence in the midst of an unstable confused world. The god-like figure is dead and consequently people have a sense of lack and desire for it to be filled. The story with its notion of order replaces God and the peace and stability found in the godhead. The narrative voice is what the characters strive for, which is why Morvern is so keen to hear what Couris Jean had said before she died, and why it is so tragic that she dies speaking an incomprehensible language. Towards the end of the novel as Morvern becomes increasingly isolated, the storytelling diminishes and all Morvern can hear is the 'silentness' (p.21). a comparison with Jesus, see Luke 3: idea is expounded by Jacques French philosopher-linguist. Wim Wenders commenting on his film Wings of Desire 'People's primary requirement is that some kind of coherence be provided. Stories give people the feeling that there is meaning, that there is ultimately an order lurking behind the incredible confusion of appearances and phenomena that surrounds them. This order is what people require more than anything else; yes, I would almost say that the notion of order or story is connected with the godhead. Stories are substitutes for God. Or maybe the other way around. (The remarks are from a talk Wenders gave at a 'colloquium on narrative technique' in 982, published as 'Impossible Stories,' in Wenders' The Logic of Images: Essays and Conversations, Frankfurt: Verlag der Autoren, Foucault argues that because the author is dead then the individual must interpret the world subjectively. The individual becomes inward and self-interested. This is demonstrated clearly through the narrative by Morvern's meticulous description and fascination of her physicality. The sensuous narrative continually describes Morvern washing, doing her nails, going to the toilet, applying her lipstick and shaving her legs. Her inward-looking fascination with herself and her body reaches the extent that she feels separate from it; when she has sex she says 'I let them do anything to me and tried to make each as satisfied as I could' (p.6). The emphasis here during such a physically binding passionate act, is the disconnection of her body from her mind and the base instinct of self and not mutual gratification. Morvern's world is the youth culture of sex, drugs and alcohol. Her music is central to her identity; guiding and encapsulating her. The 'Utopian Experience' (p.3) of the club scene is another escape from reality, a 'huge journey in that darkness' (p.03) where the music takes over and 'You didn't really have your body as your own' (p.03). She searches for experience by using up her boyfriend's money and enjoys all the pleasures of the hot island sunbathing, drinking and clubbing youth-culture, not even wishing to sleep in order that she can 'know every minute of that happiness' (p.10). see p. for the reason that she does not tell the police about her boyfriend's death the story is not so dissimilar from the parable of the lost son, see Luke 5/8:1-1, albeit with a different conclusion The fragmented, blurred and illusory identities of the characters in the novel are signified by the use of nicknames. The individuals create and re-create their subjective identity through a process of deferral from reality. The alienated self must find definition through different 'others'. Another example is the individual as consumer; Morvern is closely connected with her favourite drink Southern Comfort, her Silk Cut brand of cigarettes and her gold lighter. Her constant cycle of re-identification is portrayed by her evolution from Silk Cut onto Regals, then Sobranie and then by the end she has given up smoking. The most explicit image of the fragmented self is Morvern's boyfriend's body being cut up and spread all across the land. The cycle of the characters' lives revolve around their meaningless jobs and their nights out, with set venues and structures to their entertainment. The definition that Trevor gives to describe his group of friends is simply 'We drink' (p.28). Red Hannah laments the 'the world we've made' suggesting that despite the seemingly endless opportunities of self-fulfilment 'There is no freedom, no liberty; there's just money' as he bemoans his 'wasted life' (p.5/8). I would like to suggest that Morvern Callar demonstrates the implications of Foucault's theory and the world that is created in the wake of it. When there is no author or God, there is no objectivity, moral standards, and truth. One of Morvern's most questionable actions is when, after keeping her boyfriend's suicide a secret, she cuts up his body and distributes it over the countryside. The narrative during her exercise portrays her as a naive, innocent and playful youth. 'To the happy sound of Salif Keita doing Nyanafin I rounded the great bank of Beinn Mheadhonach, pushing down on my tanned legs. The sun was hot on my hair as His chopped-off head bumped away against my back.' (p.8)The narrator gives no moral judgement; she is a child performing what many might see to be a transgressive act, but as though she were playing a game or carrying out a banal task. Without responsibility to an objective moral standard the individual is left to judge moral actions on conscience alone and the more standards are suppressed the fewer there are and the less immanent one's conscience is. In a society where there are no rules, her actions are justifiable. Even her claimed ownership of the novel is an attempt to find an identity, an attempt of self fulfilment which the Postmodern thinker presumably must applaud. Warner's lack of moral criticism opens up the question of whether or not Morvern has any choice in the way she acts. What happens to morality and ethics when there is no centre? How does one identify oneself when there is no one to be accountable to? It could be argued that the society created, and therefore Morvern, is simply amoral, rendering her innocent, blameless and unaware of any harmful consequences of her actions. However, I would argue that our individual consciences would point us to the distinction between right and wrong. If someone were to sadistically rape, beat and cut up a young child, then it would take great an individual to claim no objective wrongdoing. Our objective ability to see a clear wrong action indicates an objective moral standard that is not controlled by the individual or the state. I grant that perception and recognition of wrong actions may become increasingly unknowable, as in Morvern's case, but I think that is a self inflicted state to begin with, as one persistently disregards one's conscience. Morvern may well be a product of her society, but that does not render her or her society innocent. It is no great intellectual or practical attribute of any individual or society to confuse morality with immorality, or to confuse right with wrong. see Romans:5/8 ultimately the state cannot control morality as it is constantly in a process of modification, re-interpretation and disintegration with no firm foundation see Isaiah:0 Foucault is correct that one cannot know dogmatically the intentions, the circumstances and the thoughts of an author. However, there is a difference between exhaustive and correct knowledge. The reader's inaptitude to know the whole context does not mean they cannot know some of it. Enough evidence can lead to a correct conclusion, without having perfect proof. As human beings, we may not share all circumstances together, but it is not a fair conclusion to say that we have nothing in common, as we are equally human. Foucault makes an illogical assumption that because meaning and interpretation will be open to some question, it is impossible to communicate any meaning faithfully. In effect, if Foucault's theory were true, then we would not be able to read his own essay and understand it so coherently. Foucault leaves the individual as a helpless, alienated and incommunicative being. However, one does not need to look too far to see communication everywhere, whether by translation, signs or systems; not perfectly, but successfully. some of the ideas in this paragraph have been taken from Marcus Honeysett's. pp.1-4 In conclusion, I have argued that Heart of Darkness represents the modern journey to Foucault's argument that the objective authorial figure is dead, and Morvern Callar illustrates the outworking of the theory. The Modern subject fails in their search to find order and stability in the world and is left darkly disillusioned and empty. The Postmodern subject seeks to fulfil the 'self' in a desperate conquest to find meaning and identity, a search that has become helplessly subjective. The individual, if Foucault is right, is left to act alone in a bleak world that has become incommunicative, de-stabilised and seemingly meaningless, despite their inner need for communication, order and morality.""","""Postmodernism and Identity Exploration""","4047","""Postmodernism and Identity Exploration are two interconnected concepts that have significantly influenced various aspects of contemporary society. Postmodernism, as a philosophical and cultural movement, emerged in the mid-20th century as a response to the perceived limitations of modernism. It introduced a new way of thinking that challenged established norms, questioned traditional values, and emphasized the complex, fragmented nature of the world. Identity exploration, on the other hand, refers to the process through which individuals seek to understand themselves, their place in society, and their relationships with others. In this context, postmodernism has played a pivotal role in shaping how people perceive and construct their identities in a rapidly changing and interconnected world.  One of the key characteristics of postmodernism is its rejection of universal truths and grand narratives in favor of a more subjective, relativistic view of reality. This rejection of overarching metanarratives has had profound implications for how individuals understand themselves and their identities. In a postmodern world, identity is no longer viewed as something fixed or essential but rather as something fluid, malleable, and contingent upon various social, cultural, and historical factors. This fluidity and multiplicity of identities have opened up new possibilities for self-exploration and self-expression, allowing individuals to move beyond rigid categories and binary oppositions.  Postmodernism has also challenged conventional notions of authenticity and originality, emphasizing instead the idea of pastiche, parody, and bricolage. In the realm of identity exploration, this has led to a reinterpretation of what it means to be authentic and how individuals can engage with different aspects of their identity. Rather than striving for a singular, coherent identity, postmodernism encourages people to embrace the contradictions, complexities, and hybridities that characterize contemporary life. This ethos of embracing plurality and difference has empowered individuals to explore and experiment with different identities, roles, and modes of self-presentation.  Furthermore, postmodernism has influenced the way individuals perceive and interact with the world through the lens of hyperreality and simulation. In a society saturated with images, signs, and symbols, the distinction between reality and representation becomes increasingly blurred. This blurring of boundaries has significant implications for how people construct their identities, negotiate their sense of self, and navigate the complexities of contemporary life. Identity, in this context, is not just a fixed set of characteristics but a dynamic and performative process that is constantly influenced and mediated by the media, technology, and cultural artifacts that surround us.  The rise of social media and digital technologies has further transformed the landscape of identity exploration in the postmodern era. Platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok provide individuals with unprecedented opportunities to curate and perform their identities online, crafting virtual personas that may differ from their offline selves. This phenomenon has raised important questions about the authenticity of online identities, the role of performance in identity construction, and the impact of digital technologies on our sense of self.  Moreover, the phenomenon of globalization has contributed to the diversification and hybridization of identities in a postmodern world. As people increasingly navigate multiple cultural influences, languages, and traditions, their sense of self becomes more fragmented and multifaceted. This process of hybridization allows individuals to draw from diverse sources of identity, creating new forms of selfhood that transcend traditional boundaries of nationality, ethnicity, and gender.  In the realm of art and literature, postmodernism has inspired a reevaluation of traditional artistic practices and storytelling techniques. Artists and writers have embraced techniques such as pastiche, intertextuality, and metafiction to reflect the fragmented, decentered nature of contemporary life. These innovative approaches to creativity have expanded the possibilities for self-expression and identity exploration, challenging audiences to rethink their assumptions about art, literature, and the world around them.  In conclusion, Postmodernism and Identity Exploration are interconnected concepts that have reshaped our understanding of selfhood, society, and culture in profound ways. By challenging fixed categories, universal truths, and traditional narratives, postmodernism has opened up new possibilities for individuals to explore, experiment, and reimagine their identities in a rapidly changing and complex world. Identity exploration, in turn, has been enriched by postmodern principles of fluidity, multiplicity, and hybridity, empowering individuals to embrace the contradictions and complexities that define contemporary life. Through art, literature, technology, and everyday practices, postmodernism continues to shape how we perceive ourselves and others, inviting us to rethink, remix, and redefine our identities in an ever-evolving global landscape.""","906"
"3079","""Research Questions:How do patients view their current exercise and splinting treatment regime? Do patients follow the advised regime suggested by their therapist? Do patients attend clinic appointments and why? A qualitative method of analysis will be used as it will enable the researcher to gain an understanding of individual's feelings and experiences about their treatment regime. Rich data will be gathered that will be used to develop new knowledge that can be used to change health care provision for treatment of RA of the hand. Semi-structured interviews will be used as they are appropriate when new information is been gathered that is somewhat abstract in it may affect their view of their current treatment regime. All participants will have to have been participating in an exercise and splinting regime for the RA of the hand for at least weeks prior to partaking in this study to allow for time to get used to the exercise and splinting regime. This study will be using non-probability sampling. The key to using non-probability sampling is to attain the greatest degree of representation as possible and to clearly identify to your readers the limitations of your findings (Depoy & Gitlin, 994). All participants will receive information about the study in the letter, stating the aim if the study, what will be required and methods of assessment. This will enable the participant to decide if they wish to partake in expressing their views in this study. If they are willing they will be required to sign a written consent form. Data Collection:This study aims to investigate participant's feelings towards their treatment regime for RA of the hand; a qualitative approach in the form of a semi-structure interview will be used. The semi-structured interview has predetermined questions, but the order can be modified based on the interviewer's perception of what seems more appropriate. Question wording can be changed or explanations given; particular questions which seem inappropriate with a particular interviewee can be omitted, or additional ones included (Robson, 002); to gain the relevant data to answer the research question. All interviewers will have received training in interviewing techniques to ensure consistency in interviewing style to increase the study reliability. The interviews will be carried out face-to-face, one-on-one within a small, private, quiet, comfortable room within the hospital. This will provide a setting in which privacy is assured and neither the participant nor interviewer will be distracted. A full record of the interview will be taken. Each interview will be tape recoded to allow the entire conversation to be replayed for analysis. Notes will also be made, in case there is a problem with the tape recording. Aspects of the interview that will not appear on the tape such as body language and paused will also be recorded, making the interview more reliable (Silverman, 001). An interview diary will also be kept where the interviewer will note any occasion where he/she might have influenced the results, to increase validity. To eliminate any power aspect the interviewer will not have had any previous contact with the participant. The interviewer will introduce themselves to the participant as a researcher; not giving a specific occupation e.g. physiotherapist. The interviewer will wear casual clothes. This will help to reduce the Hawthorn effect, where the participant gives the response that he/she thinks the research wants to hear. The interviewer will aim to put the participant at ease so that the participant will feel comfortable to openly express their thoughts and opinions about their current treatment regime. The interviewer will follow a schedule during the interview. The same interviewer will conduct all the interviews so that the style of interview will not change (standardised); adding to the reliability and validity of the study. An example of the schedule can be found in the Appendix. A pilot study will be performed on some patients with RA of the hand who attend the hospital. The aim of the pilot study is run two or three trial interviews to eliminate any problems which may have been overlooked. The pilot study may also suggest additional questions that should be explored (Robson, 002). Data Analysis:the analysis will begin immediately while the information is still fresh in the researchers mind. No real names will be used in the transcribed text to ensure participant confidentiality. A thematic analysis will be used; the tape recordings will be transcribed; the transcripts will then be read through repeatedly to pick out recurring themes relating to the research question. The themes will then be coded so that they can be compared to those in other interviews. Reliability is greatest when the themes are clearly stated and do not overlap (French et al, 001). Once the themes from each interview have been identified the researcher will check with the participant that they have the correct interpretation of what they said. The themes will be compared to generate a theory to answer the research question. The data will be analysed independently by three researchers to establish recurring themes. This will help to eliminate personal opinions when the data is interpreted and promote truthfulness. Triangulation, member checking and audit trails provide strategies that will help to rule out threats to validity, however there is no fool proof way of guaranteeing validity (Robson, 002). In quantative research threats to validity are dealt with in advance as part of the design process; in qualitative research they are dealt with after the research process is in progress. 'Triangulation' refers to an approach of data collection where evidence is deliberately sought from a wide range of different sources (Mays & Pope, 995/8). In this study oral testimonies will be compared with written records. Member checking will be carried out; this will involve giving a copy of the transcript to the participant to ensure that what has been transcribed is an accurate reflection of what was said; ensuring truthfulness. To further promote truthfulness an audit trail will be kept allowing the analysis to be traced. This reduces the threat of interview bias (Robson, 002). The researcher will examine 'negative cases', where the researchers analysis contradicts the study findings the researcher will identify these findings and try and explain why the data may vary (Mays & Pope, 995/8), in order to increase reliability and validity. Ethics: As previously mentioned written informed consent will be gained prior to interview. To ensure confidentiality all participants will be allocated a number and all data will be stored under those numbers. All data will be stored in a password protected computer or in a locked cabinet. Once the data has been analysed the key findings of the study will be made available to the participants.""","""Patient treatment perceptions for RA.""","1296","""Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints, causing pain, swelling, stiffness, and potentially leading to joint damage and disability if left untreated. The management of RA involves a multimodal approach that includes medication, physical therapy, lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, surgery. Patient perceptions of their treatment for RA play a crucial role in their overall health outcomes and quality of life.  One of the key aspects of patient treatment perceptions for RA is understanding the importance of early diagnosis and timely initiation of treatment. Early detection of RA and prompt intervention can help prevent or minimize joint damage, reduce pain and inflammation, and improve long-term outcomes. Patients who are actively involved in their treatment plan from the beginning are more likely to adhere to their medication regimen, follow lifestyle recommendations, and engage in self-management strategies.  Medications are a cornerstone of RA treatment, and patients may have varying perceptions of different drug classes used to manage the disease. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate and biologics, are commonly prescribed to suppress inflammation and slow down disease progression. Some patients may have concerns about the long-term use of these medications, potential side effects, or the inconvenience of frequent injections or infusions. Healthcare providers play a critical role in addressing these concerns, educating patients about the benefits and risks of treatment options, and involving patients in shared decision-making.  Non-pharmacological treatments such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and lifestyle modifications are also important components of RA management. Patients may have varying perceptions of the role of these interventions in their treatment plan. Physical therapy can help improve joint mobility, strengthen muscles, and reduce pain, while occupational therapy focuses on enhancing daily functioning and independence. Lifestyle modifications such as exercise, diet, stress management, and smoking cessation can also positively impact RA symptoms and overall well-being. Patients who are open to incorporating these strategies into their daily routine are more likely to experience better outcomes.  Surgery may be considered for patients with advanced joint damage or severe disability due to RA. Procedures such as joint replacement surgery can help restore function and mobility, alleviate pain, and improve quality of life. Patients' perceptions of surgery for RA can vary widely, with some individuals viewing it as a last resort option and others seeing it as a positive step towards regaining independence and improving their overall health. Education and communication between patients and their healthcare providers are crucial in addressing any fears or misconceptions about surgical interventions.  Psychosocial factors also play a significant role in patient treatment perceptions for RA. Living with a chronic illness like RA can have a profound impact on an individual's mental and emotional well-being. Patients may experience feelings of frustration, uncertainty, isolation, and depression as they navigate the challenges of managing their condition. Healthcare providers should address the psychosocial aspects of RA by offering holistic care that addresses both physical and emotional needs. Support groups, counseling, and mindfulness techniques can help patients cope with the emotional toll of RA and improve their overall treatment experience.  In conclusion, patient treatment perceptions for RA are multifaceted and can significantly influence disease management and outcomes. By understanding and addressing patient concerns, preferences, and beliefs about treatment options, healthcare providers can enhance patient engagement, adherence, and overall satisfaction with their care. A patient-centered approach that considers the individual needs and perspectives of each patient is essential in optimizing the treatment experience for individuals living with RA. Through effective communication, education, and support, patients can actively participate in their treatment journey and achieve better health and quality of life despite the challenges of living with RA.""","720"
"204","""Section 1.) INTRODUCTIONA Company Strategy is a specific step which enables a company to accomplish a required goal. Making Strategy involves a continuous process of research and decision-making. Knowledge of yourself and your company is a vital starting point in setting objectives. A manufacturing simulation exercise 'Aerials' was very useful in understanding the significance and application of tools used in manufacturing industries for planning and control. At the end of the game the total final cash left with our group 'Falcon' was 77,71 and final worth 02,76..) OUR STRATEGYSince we took over the firm in the thirteenth week and were told that sale is through a chain of distributors we at the beginning of the game by mutual planning set ourselves two objectives: Financially Focused Objective:5/8% of profitCustomer Focused Objective: To meet 0% of customer demandsIn order to achieve these objectives we made following strategy Utilize capacity efficiencyReduce scrap to a minimumWe tried to keep our production costs low by utilizing capacity and using different shifts when necessary by precise forecasting and efficient inventory management to ensure on-time delivery. The way we used logistics and operations management tools to help us achieve our objectives are described below..) ForecastingForecasting is predicting or estimating before hand. It plays a very important role in capacity planning and inventory management and also provides valuable input to other functions of the organisation. Forecasting is based primarily on two main methods. Qualitative forecasting - where no past data is availableQuantitative forecasting - involve the analysis of the past data to predict future market demand.) Forecasting TechniqueSelecting the forecasting technique was a difficult task for our STRATEGIES1.) Level: week 3 th to 6 thWe were reactive and chasing demand as it occurs, in 4 th and 5/8 th week we didn't order any raw material because demand was too low, lower than past year's average. We were concerned with the cash flow so that in an attempt to order lots of raw material we may not run out of cash and go bankrupt. In the first level after gaining some profits we transferred money from current account to deposit account and earned some positive interest. In 6 th week we didn't produce any aerial so our unit cost for this period increased to 7,00 which was much higher than the lowest unit cost 7 in the day shift. The reason for this we thought we have enough finished goods inventory to supply next week. By this chase strategy we paid huge fixed cost which could have been avoided by utilizing a shift..) Level: week 7 th to 0 thBefore starting this level we calculated break even analysis which came 000 units every week so that we may not again miss the opportunity of utilizing capacity and pay the fixed costs. We became proactive rather than reactive since our demand was fluctuating. In the trend there was a rise in the demand and the peak period comes gradually with modest peak in third week followed by highest peak in fourth week. In order to meet this demand we decided to build up stock to buffer against supply problems and finished goods stock to buffer against fluctuations in demand keeping in view the next peak period. We insisted on make to stock because cost of holding inventory in the game is only.% compared to 2 % penalty of the sales value of under delivered goods. We accumulated finished goods stock than depleted in the peak period and made profits. In this level we added 0% more to our forecasted demand because of scrap, rework and machine down time. By the end of this level i.e. in weeks 9 and 0 we ordered more raw materials due to introduction of a new model XL which requires two units of accessories in addition to the other components, keeping in view one raw material has greater lead time..) Level: week 1 st to 4 thDuring the third level with the introduction of the XL model, the break-even point stood at 5/860 units for XL models but was pushed a little higher to 200 units for standard model per week. A 200 units figure, being a conservative out of the two, was picked up as a break-even point by our group. It was primarily due to an increase in semi-fixed costs. However, the reason for drop in the break-even units for XL model was increase in the contribution as a result of increase in the selling price. There was a very marginal increase in the cost of the product but the rise in the labour cost was covered by the increase in contribution per unit. On the whole break-even point was a useful tool to monitor our progress during the game. In a group we decided to keep a healthy stock of 'accessories' because they would only cost and had a two weeks' delivery time. Although being cheap this component was equally important for the production. Increased usage of this component in production of aerials for XL model in level was another reason to keep high inventory of this component in the later weeks. Keeping a stock of 'accessories' did not put much burden on our finances and ensured the availability at all times. We decided to reduce the stock of 'main body' and 'aerial' as these were expensive items to keep in stock and would also increase our cost of holding inventory. Shorter delivery time was another reason to reduce the stock for these items. The only time that we would increase the stock for these items was a weak before expected rise in demand to enable us to increase our finished goods stock. By looking at the trend last year it was detectable that every fourth week there is a rise in the demand and peak period comes gradually with modest peak in third week followed by highest peak in fourth week. In order to meet this demand we decided to build up stock to meet customers demand in these peak periods. It can be seen from the figures. and. below we had inventory cost almost throughout the three levels and the total at the end of 4 th week was 3,71 compared to 1,20 penalty cost which we had only five times. Initially we were only focused on meeting customers demand and ordering a lot of raw materials so had inventory costs but after looking at bank conditions we started forecasting more accurately to avoid cost of holding inventory also. Than we tried our best to do accurate forecasting but forecasting is never accurate and we had penalties, especially at the end of game in 3 rd and 4 th weeks. I think our group under forecasted a little as overall we satisfied 8% of our customers demand and had penalties for the 2% orders we missed to deliver..) MANAGEMENT OF get the right product to right place at right time and for right cost it is necessary to schedule activities in an effectual manner. Because no matter how good scheduling methods are it is unlikely that supply and demand will be in accord. Supply chain then require batching of materials for efficiency. To get the full advantage a balance must be achieved with quantities that promote efficiency and to avoid disadvantages of tied up inventory and money From customer's view point the order winner for our product is on time delivery since any shortages in supply are not carried forward. Since the demand is rising which is 5/8% more than last year we made every effort not to miss the peak in demand where greatest profit were available and not responding late when capacity exceeds demand, increasing inventory and further loss in profitability. In an attempt to satisfy most of our customer's demand we emphasised to keep more finished goods than raw materials as the cost of holding inventory is same.% of the value for both raw materials and finished goods..) CAPACITY MANAGEMENT:Capacity is the ability to produce. The overall aim of capacity management is to match the level of demand with the level of production. Less production than the demand means missed opportunity in terms of sales, turnover and profit. It also results in dissatisfaction among customers as a result an organisation looses market share. Over capacity means under utilisation of assets. Therefore, capacity management is another important area in operations management that needs to be carefully worked out. We operated our production system on 'made to stock'. Our total production capacity was 0,5/80 units per week against an average weekly forecast of 25/80 units. Running a Saturday shift was not a feasible option in which a unit cost was 7., more than the selling price of 5/8, and which could only produce 00 units. Our strategy was to keep our unit cost at the lowest so that we could earn a reasonable profit from our sales. Based on this strategy we decided to produce at least 000 units per week running a day shift to take advantage of low labour cost and decided to keep the unsold goods in stock for a peak demand period. It kept our unit cost at 7. per unit and helped us earn a reasonably good profit. As a contingency measure we also decided to run a night in four weeks to reach 5/8,00 units in a month approximately so that we do not miss the peak week..) INTRODUCTIONIf a firm could order merchandise or raw materials and carry inventory with no expenses other than the cost of these items, there would be no need to be concerned about what quantity to order at a given time. However inventory costs are affected by both the cost of purchasing and the cost of carrying inventory i.e. Total inventory cost = total carrying costs total ordering costs Carrying cost increase as inventories increase in size as it is sum of storage costs, insurance premiums, costs of money tied up in inventory, loses due to obsolescence or spoilage, opportunity cost, deterioration cost and other expenses. Ordering costs also known as purchase cost or set up cost, this is the sum of the fixed costs that are incurred each time an item is ordered. These costs are not associated with the quantity ordered but primarily with physical activities required to process the order include expenses associated with preparation and processing of purchase orders and expenses related to receiving and expecting purchase items. Inventory is held to avoid the nuisance, the time and the cost etc. of constant replenishment. However, to replenish inventory only infrequently would necessitate the holding of very large inventories. It is therefore apparent that some balance or trade-off or compromise is needed in deciding how much inventory to hold, and therefore how much inventory to order. There are costs of holding inventory and there are costs of re-ordering inventory and these two costs need to be balanced. The point at which unit cost of preparing the purchase order for a quantity equals to the unit cost of carrying the materials in store is known as Economic Order CONTROLWhen determining how much to order at a time, an organisation will recognise that as order quantity rises, average stock rises and the total annual cost of holding stock rises and the number of orders decreases and the total annual re-order costs decrease. The point at which cost is minimised is the EOQ. This cost behaviour is illustrated by the graph in Figure. The first curve is drawn to show the acquisition or procurement costs. This curve can be expected to fall from left to right as the quantity to be bought on each purchase order is increased. This effect arises from the supplier's quantity discounts and, to smaller extent, from administrative savings made as a result of having to prepare purchase orders at less frequent intervals. The second curve is for stock holding costs. It will rise from left to right, as increased amounts are purchased and the cost of inventory investment and storage grow. The third curve is the result of adding first two curves together. This gives a curve of total procurement and stockholding costs. The minimum point of this curve corresponds to the intersection of purchasing and inventory curves. This minimum point indicates the economic order quantity..) REDUCED COSTSThe way to address demand distortion caused by order batching is to find ways to reduce the cost of order processing and transportation. This will cause EOQ lot sizes to get smaller and orders to be placed more frequently. The result will be a smoother flow of orders that distributors and manufacturers will be able to handle more efficiently. Ordering costs can be reduced by using electronic ordering technology. Transportation costs can be reduced by using third party logistics cost effectively pick up many small shipments from suppliers and deliver small orders to many customers..) QUANTITY DISCOUNTSThe basic EOQ formula assumes that the purchase price per unit will be the same regardless of the number of units ordered. However, vendors often lower the unit price as the quantity ordered increases, because the lowered unit cost of shipping and handling the order. When quantity discounts are offered, such savings reduce unit acquisition costs still further as the order size increases..) INTRODUCTIONThe economic order quantity is the replenishment order quantity that minimizes the combined cost of inventory maintenance and ordering. Identification of such a quantity assumes that demand and cost are relatively stable throughout the year. It also requires some stringent applications that constrain its direct application. The major assumptions of the simple EOQ model are satisfaction of all demandcontinuous, constant and known rate of demandconstant and known replenishment performance cycle timeconstant price of product that is independent of order quantity or timeinfinite planning horizonno interaction between multiple items of inventoryno inventory in transitno limit on capital availability.) USE OF EOQ IN SYNDICATE COMPANYOne of basic assumptions of EOQ is stable demand so that raw materials can be ordered in fixed quantities every time ensuring efficient inventory control and reduced costs. Our syndicate a very unstable demand but with a trend involved. Every fourth week there is a peak week gradually with a moderate peak in third week which can be easily seen on the graph below. In such a situation where demand is totally unstable EOQ cannot be used to represent the best buy quantity. There was also a limit to the maximum overdraft available which restricts the quantity of raw material to be ordered. Comparing ordering costs only 0 per order with cost of holding of holding inventory.% of the value for both the raw materials and finished goods, so it was better to order every week when in need to satisfy customers demand rather than using EOQ and not ordering every week ultimately holding inventory and paying its value. EOQ could have been used to order raw materials if the demand was stable and without seasonality. In this situation we know how much to produce every month and so how much raw material we will be in need every month. It could save the inventory carrying costs when the inventory is in idleness..) INTRODUCTIONMaster production schedule translates the sales and operation plan of the company into production plan for producing specific products in the future. Sales and operations plan provides an aggregate statement of the manufacturing output required to reach company objectives while the MPS is a statement of the specific products that makeup that output. An effective MPS provides the basis for making good use of manufacturing resources, on time deliveries, and to attain firm's strategic objectives as reflected in the sales and operations plan. It specifies how product will be supplied to meet future demand. It is a statement of production and not a statement of demand or a forecast. It is only the statement of planned future output..) ASSUMPTIONSDemand will be 5/8% more than last year's sales in respective weeks. Raw materials; Aerials and Bodies arrive on time i.e. one week after ordering and Accessories in two weeks timeTaking into account % scrap, % rework and % machine down time so actual production will be 0% of the total..) FORECASTINGForecast is an important input into the planning process that determines the master production schedule. The MPS, although based on forecast differs from the forecast in many ways. It takes into account capacity limitations, the costs of production, other resource considerations and the sales and operations whereas in forecasting these are not considered..) Forecasted Demand for STDThe average demand of last year from = 415/8 The average demand of last year from weeks through week 4=712 This year average sales from weeks through week 4= 5/804. This year sale for standard model is 4.76% greater than last year sales so there is a growth factor of approximately 5/8%. So aggregate demand can be expected to be 712 x 5/8% increase = 419 or 400 approximately Taking into account scrap rate, rework and machine down overall 0% 419 x 0% = 961 or 000 Total production should be 000 per week in order to satisfy the demand of 400..) Forecasted Demand for XLSince there is no last year's data available for XL model so using simple moving averages for calculating the demand. Average sales per week this year from weeks 1 to 4 = 675/8 or 700 approximately Total production 675/8 x 0% = 942 or 000 Total production of XL model should be 000 per week in order to satisfy the demand of 700. On the basis of this forecast data master production schedule is developed..) CAPACITY MANAGMENTThe total production capacity is 2,00 units per week against an average weekly forecast of 000 units, 000 STD and 000 XL. Running a Saturday shift is not a feasible option in which a unit cost is 6 for STD and 7 for XL, more than the selling price of 5/8, and which could only produce 000 units. Evening shift is also not a better option since per unit cost in evening shift is more than in day and night shifts and it produces only 40 units per shift. The projected demand for STD model is 000 units per week which could be manufactured in day shift having the lowest per unit cost of 9.3. Demand for XL model is 000 units per week or 2000 units per month. The next feasible shift is night shift having per unit cost of 9 for the XL model with a capacity of 000 units per week. Making 000 units in the night shift every week can waste the capacity. To utilize capacity efficiency night shifts could be used three times a month fulfilling the monthly demand of 2000 rather than 000 every week. In this way capacity will be fully utilized and savings would be made in the semi fixed cost and labour cost by not using the night shift once in a month and still satisfying the customer's demand. It will increase the inventory cost, but compared with semi fixed cost of night shift is very low..) MASTER PRODUCTION SCHEDULE4.) Weeks 5/8 to 8In the starting 5/8 th week with such high inventory levels the proposed strategy is to reduce raw material inventory by producing the maximum 100 units utilizing the day and night shifts. To reduce finished goods inventory in the 6 th week make enough STD and XL model to meet customer's demand and not utilizing the full shift and holding inventory. Later on in the 7 th and 8 th weeks as it was assumed that demand is stable so producing 000 STD model and 000 XL model and ordering raw material accordingly. The demand for XL is 000 units per week so by 0 th week there would be much inventory of XL to meet demand and there will be no need for producing in that week. Accessories for XL which will not be required in 0 th week are not ordered in 8 th week, keeping in view the lead time for accessories is two weeks..) Week 9= Week 2Since the demand is stable and producing the exact quantity, there is no inventory for the raw materials and finished good STD, a very little inventory cost for XL model. As the inventory of XL builds up in three consecutive weeks there is no need for producing in the fourth week so in 0 th week there will be enough inventory of XL to meet the demand. As a result raw material for XL, main body and aerial is not ordered in 9 th week which have a lead time of one week..) Week 3 = Week 5/8The same strategy continues in following weeks from 3 to 5/8..) INTRODUCTIONFulfilling the fluctuating product demand is critical to any supplier, manufacturer, or retailer. Forecasts of future demand will determine the quantities that should be purchased, produced, and shipped. Demand forecasts are necessary since the basic operations process, moving from the suppliers' raw materials to finished goods in the customers' hands, takes time. On the other hand inventories provide a level of product or service availability, which, when located in the proximity of the customer, can meet a high customer service requirement..) NATURE OF DEMANDForecasted demand can be classified as either dependent or independent. Dependent demand is represented by the vertical sequence characteristic of purchasing and manufacturing situations. The company manufactures plastic components that will be assembled to form finished goods in the automobiles. In this dependent demand situation, plastic components requirements depend on the automotive assembly schedule..) FORECASTING THE DEMAND FOR FIRST CUSTOMEROrders received from original equipments manufacturers OEM are quite stable so simple Moving Averages technique can be used to predict future market demand. This technique is the simplest way of smoothing past data that is used for forecasting. Most recent data is most relevant in forecasting short-term demand because it reveals latest trends better than data several years old..) ProposalSince the demand is stable for first customer so EOQ is suitable to use for raw material supply which minimizes the total cost of ordering and carrying inventory. Due to an increase in demand in the past few months a new shift is also introduced so producing regularly can fulfil customers demand without any need to stock..) FORECASTING THE DEMAND FOR SECOND CUSTOMEROrders from other customers vary and have unstable demand therefore to satisfy this customer made to stock policy is better..) Fulfilling Demand MethodologyCompany shouldn't wait for demand to emerge and then react to it. Instead, the company must anticipate and plan for future demand so that can react immediately to customer orders as they occur. In other words, company should adopt the strategy of 'make to stock' rather than 'make to order' and then deploy inventories of finished goods..) Forecasting TechniqueMoving Average is a good technique used in the forecasting but the biggest disadvantage is that it gives equal weight to old and recent data. This problem is solved in 'exponential smoothing' technique that gives more weight to the most recent observations which reflects most recent trends. By using this technique more accurate forecasts can be made. Therefore, it is recommended that this technique should be used in future to satisfy the second customer. The Times series forecasting technique provides great benefit of understanding and meeting customers fluctuating demand and in this way the demand can be fulfilled to earn goodwill in the corporate world..) Collaborative forecastingAdopting the collaborative forecasting, the retailers would share their demand forecasts and their current order plans with the manufacturer, and the manufacturer would aggregate these data to construct and verify its forecasts. Discrepancies between the retail order plans and the manufacturer forecasts would be identified and resolved. The final result would be improved forecast accuracy, less total inventory in the system, and a smoother deployment of the goods into the retail channel. In this way the company can definitely fulfil the fluctuating demand..) PROBLEMS OF ADDITIONAL SHIFTThere is an increase in overall volume in the past 8 months due to which an additional shift is introduced. The following problems may likely to occur; Labour cost will be increased. Semi-fixed cost of additional shift will be added to the trading accounts Per unit cost of product will be more in the additional shift Due to over use of multi purpose machines, wear and tear will be more and machine reliability will decrease Machines having setup time more than 0 minutes, probably in many hours cannot be used in additional shift Raw material will be needed to order in larger quantities so tied up capital Due to additional shift inventories of finished goods will be more if it fails to replenish in time. To hold high level of finished goods greater space is required so warehouse problem will occur i) Floor Space problem will gives rise to product storage congestion and excess material clutters aisle, impeding flow of workers and material.. OTHER OPTIONS THAN USING ADDITIONAL SHIFTTo meet the increase in demand rather using additional shift other options might be:.) Decrease Setup TimeOne option is to decrease the setup time, even if setup time is part of standard, no parts are made while the equipment is being setup. The way to maximize standard hours is to avoid setups-run as much as possible. By inference, this puts an extremely high cost on setup time, it encourages supervisors to produce as much as possible even if it is not needed and also encourages to run the machine constantly to earn highest ratio of potential hours earned versus actual hours worked. It discourages setups. In practice, it does not generally encourage supervisors to put much effort into refining the skills and practices for setups. Workforce should be multi skilled so they can help the operators removing and replacing tool sets of preparation. This will increase the speed in changeovers. Single minute exchange of can be used very successfully in reducing setup times..) Increase Machine ReliabilityLoss of production due to machine reliability can be overcome by decreasing downtime, avoiding any breakdowns, scrap and rework. Production rate for old machines can be corrected by proper maintenance..) New MachineryIf the firm has sufficient funds than it is beneficial to install new machinery. This in turn will attain efficient actual production rate..) OutsourcingIf additional shift cost are high and company has no sufficient funds to buy a new machinery subcontracting helps to fulfil the customer's demand in time..) Vendor Managed more peopleMore workforce can be hired rather using an extra shift to overcome holidays, illness and absenteeism to maximize production. In this way products can be manufactured in machine idle time..) Planned MaintenanceProductivity can be improved by closely monitoring the process initially, periodi reviews and continuous improvement..) Staff Selection and TrainingInclusion of factors such as training and motivation has an important role to play in designing jobs that are interesting and responsible. A contented, secure work force will perform far better than a work force that feels threatened and abused. By training people, maximum utilization of human resources can be achieved where everyone works in the same direction and thinks inline. This would increase productivity in a single shift so minimizing the need for an additional shift.""","""Manufacturing strategy and operations management""","5303","""Manufacturing Strategy and Operations Management are crucial components in the success of any organization involved in the production of goods. These two areas work synergistically to ensure that a company's manufacturing processes are optimized for efficiency, quality, cost-effectiveness, and the timely delivery of products to customers. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the intricacies of manufacturing strategy and operations management, exploring key concepts, strategies, and best practices that drive success in the competitive manufacturing landscape.  Manufacturing Strategy is the overarching plan that defines how a company will utilize its resources to achieve its manufacturing objectives. It involves making decisions about what products to produce, where to produce them, how to produce them, and how to deliver them to customers. A well-crafted manufacturing strategy aligns the company's manufacturing capabilities with its overall business strategy, ensuring that manufacturing operations contribute to the company's competitive advantage.  There are several key elements to consider when developing a manufacturing strategy. Firstly, a company must define its manufacturing goals and objectives, which may include improving product quality, reducing costs, increasing production volume, or shortening lead times. These goals should be aligned with the broader corporate strategy to ensure coherence across all functions of the organization.  Another essential aspect of manufacturing strategy is product design and process engineering. Companies must design products that are easy and cost-effective to manufacture, leveraging technologies and processes that optimize efficiency and quality. Concurrent engineering, where product design and manufacturing processes are developed in parallel, can help reduce time-to-market and enhance product quality.  Furthermore, manufacturing strategy encompasses decisions about capacity planning, production scheduling, inventory management, and quality control. By optimizing these elements, companies can improve production efficiency, reduce lead times, minimize costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. Just-in-time (JIT) and lean manufacturing principles are often employed to streamline operations and eliminate waste in the production process.  In addition to internal considerations, manufacturing strategy also involves assessing external factors such as market trends, competitors, regulatory requirements, and technological advancements. Companies must be agile and responsive to changes in the business environment, adjusting their manufacturing strategies to stay competitive and meet evolving customer demands.  Operations Management, on the other hand, focuses on the day-to-day execution of the manufacturing strategy. It involves planning, organizing, and controlling the activities that transform inputs into finished goods. Operations managers play a critical role in overseeing production processes, optimizing resource utilization, monitoring performance metrics, and driving continuous improvement initiatives.  One of the fundamental principles of operations management is the design of efficient production systems. Companies must structure their manufacturing facilities, equipment, and workflows in a way that maximizes productivity and minimizes inefficiencies. Layout design, process flow analysis, and automation technologies are utilized to create seamless and efficient operations.  Efficient production planning and control are essential components of operations management. Production planning involves setting production targets, determining resource requirements, and creating schedules to meet customer orders. Production control focuses on monitoring production progress, resolving bottlenecks, and adapting plans to ensure on-time delivery.  Inventory management is another critical aspect of operations management. Companies must carefully balance inventory levels to meet customer demand while minimizing holding costs and stockouts. Strategies such as just-in-time inventory, vendor-managed inventory, and ABC analysis can help optimize inventory practices and improve cash flow.  Quality management is integral to operations management, as it ensures that products meet or exceed customer expectations. Quality control techniques such as statistical process control, Six Sigma, and total quality management are employed to monitor and improve product quality throughout the production process.  Continuous improvement is a core tenet of operations management. Companies strive to enhance operational efficiency, reduce waste, and increase productivity through initiatives like Kaizen, 5S, and value stream mapping. By fostering a culture of continuous improvement, organizations can adapt to changing market conditions and drive sustainable growth.  In today's competitive manufacturing landscape, digital technologies play a vital role in optimizing operations. Industry 4.0 technologies such as IoT, AI, data analytics, and automation are transforming manufacturing processes, enabling real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and smart decision-making. Companies that embrace digital transformation can gain a competitive edge by improving efficiency, agility, and innovation.  Effective communication and collaboration are essential for successful manufacturing strategy and operations management. Cross-functional teams comprising professionals from engineering, production, supply chain, and quality assurance collaborate to identify opportunities for improvement, address challenges, and implement solutions that drive operational excellence.  Ultimately, manufacturing strategy and operations management are integral to the success of any organization engaged in manufacturing. By aligning manufacturing strategies with business goals, optimizing production processes, leveraging technology, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, companies can enhance their competitiveness, drive growth, and deliver value to customers. Through strategic planning, efficient operations, and a commitment to excellence, organizations can thrive in a dynamic and ever-evolving marketplace.""","959"
"255","""In order to effectively assess the influence and legacy of this immense historian it is essential to deal with the method and philosophy that underpinned his prolific work. Some scholars believe that Ranke has been misunderstood by many and that his impact has been manipulated to serve specific purposes. This essay will attempt to unmask the true essence of Ranke's historical philosophy in order to discover his relationship with scientific history. In light of this it will become possible to conclude whether or not he can be accurately described as 'the father of scientific history'. Certainly, Ranke's methodology was riddled with scientific precision. He was utterly convinced of the need to consult primary texts as sources; these were the embodiment of historical truth. Having trawled through the archives the historian's next task according to him was to corroborate and compose a critique of the evidence at hand. Above all, given the nature of Ranke's chosen field - the history of the nation state - the most useful data were the official documents of European statesmen. The state according to his historical philosophy was the manifestation of God's providence, a divine tool which affected the workings and progress of history. They were, 'the primary units of his history.the core of knowable human activity in the past'. Leonard Krieger, Ranke: The Meaning of investigation with the quite different ideological formation, empiricism'. For Ranke this was a means to an end, the most suitable way to produce accurate history and 'to represent the past objectively'. This search for historical truth was a 'noble dream' according to American historiography. Krieger, Ranke, p.2 Edward Thompson, The Poverty of Theory and Other Essays (London, 978), p. Green and Troup (eds.), The Houses of History, p. Georg Iggers' well-known critique of such American historians, who heralded Ranke as their empiricist historical figurehead, provides us with an excellent account of the way his work has been misinterpreted. However, generalisations made by Iggers have, to a certain extent, been deconstructed by Dorothy Ross. Although some American historians of the early twentieth-century undoubtedly manipulated Ranke's work to suit their own ends this was not representative of the entire historical profession in the United States. Ross quite rightly has alerted us to the fact that the American historical profession in its formative years was much more 'heterogeneous' than Iggers would like to think. Having said that, Ross admits that where they were not entirely philosophically ignorant they were not 'philosophically sophisticated' either and were keen to rule out the 'kind of philosophy which had religious or metaphysical intentions'. For American historians, if the historical intention of their scholarship was not to achieve the pinnacle of objective and empirical factual history, thereby mistakenly taking Ranke as its epitome, then the development of a political history intended to bolster liberal academic prestige was the priority. Certainly, there did exist a significant portion of American historians that incorrectly believed that their work followed in the footsteps of Ranke. Dorothy Ross, 'On The Misunderstandings of Ranke and The Origins of The Historical Profession in America', in Georg Iggers and James Powell (eds.), Leopold von Ranke and The Shaping of The Historical Discipline (Syracuse, 990), pp.5/89-60 Ross, 'On The Misunderstandings of Ranke', pp.5/84-62 Hence, according to Iggers, in their historiography Ranke was more important as a symbol rather than as a historian. They consciously interpreted his work as scientific and detached from philosophy. It is their misconceptions that have led some to ascribe the title 'father of scientific history' to him. The role Ranke played in German historiography has been used by Iggers in diametric opposition to that which he was forced to play in America. In Germany Ranke's true philosophical perception was readily accepted and well conceived. In the late twentieth-century there was a reappraisal of Ranke's role in American historiography as the German interpretation crossed the Atlantic. Before this occurred it was de rigueur in the American historical academies for Rankean thought to be regarded as a symbol for history as a natural science. The empirical nature of Ranke's methodology was overly emphasised by this breed of historian to add a greater level of intellectual weight to their theory. Georg Iggers, 'The Image of Ranke in American and German Historical Thought, History and Theory, Vol., No., pp.8-9 In doing so, American historians bastardised Ranke's historical philosophy, asserting that the clinical and objective search for truth should supersede any deeper meaning. In 908, George B. Adams proclaimed that 'the first duty of the historian' was to discover 'wie es eigentlich gewesen', and in this address to the nascent American Historical Association he called Ranke their 'leader'. The academic history of this school was steeped in a scientific thirst for objectivity and factual sophistication. Undeniably, this was paramount in Rankean historicism but their brief and simplistic reading of his work led them to assume that Ranke believed that the only job of the historian was to establish 'facts for their own sake'. Iggers has shown that it is necessary to revise this view of Ranke, and believes that the process for re-interpreting his work began with Ferdinand Schevill, who pointed out that these American historians had created a 'leader' that 'bore little resemblance to the real Ranke, who had been led to the study of history by philosophical and religious interests'. Schevill continued to remark that 'throughout his career Ranke had worked toward a theory of historical forces as ideas which focused moral energies divine in origin. He was much closer to the German tradition of idealism, which had always challenged the dominance and arrogance of the positivistic spirit, than any of his American disciples, who worshipped so uncritically at the shrine of science. They had simply made Ranke over in their own image'. Iggers, 'The Image of Ranke', pp.1-4 Iggers, 'The Image of Ranke', p.0 Ranke's misunderstood legacy amongst twentieth-century historians has in some cases given rise to the belief that Ranke wished to indiscriminately sever the relationship between history as an art and as a science. In 902, J.B. Bury noted that 'history is a science, no more, no less', because of the 'minute method of analysing.sources and scrupulously exact conformity to facts'. However, this is the stripping down of history to its bare bones - removing the literary aspect of narration, which for Ranke would have meant the destruction of history. 'Sixty-five years later', Geoffrey Elton reiterated a similar belief. 'Careful evaluation and authentication of primary source material is one of Ranke's most significant legacies'. True, but it is only one aspect. The dangers of misinterpreting Ranke are numerous - they can lead to boring factual history as championed by Bury and also, perhaps at the extreme, it can lead to moral relativism. The idea that all epochs and attitudes are equal before God and that all morals are of equal value can lead to the formation of dangerous philosophies. Since 'absolute truth is unattainable' then 'all statements about history are connected or relative to the position of those that make them', hence one set of morals becomes just as perfectly justifiable and acceptable as another. However, a closer look at Ranke's philosophy shows us that, true to his belief in an all-pervasive universal element governing history, the particularity of specific individuals and epochs was set 'apart from certain unchanging, eternal dominant ideas, such as moral ideas'. Morality was not subject to change because it was part of 'the universal human reality transcending each of its individual expressions'. Green and Troup (eds.), The Houses of History, pp.- Green and Troup (eds.), The Houses of History, pp.- Krieger, Ranke, pp.7-8 It is possible to realign Ranke with artistic literary devices and this has been a recent postmodernist trend. The rediscovery of the 'rhetoric and aesthetics of historiography' has become important because its modernity was 'defined by its academic or - in a broader sense of the word - by its scientific character'. The problem inherent in this approach is that it leads to a tendentious interpretation. It is possible to see Ranke as the epitome of mediation between these diverging points of view because he combined a 'new academic standard' with renewed 'literary quality'. In order to 'show how it really had been', Ranke elevated empirical qualities above the dated and imprecise rhetoric and dialogue which was preferred by historians of older generations, such as Francesco Guicciardini. He viewed rhetorical dialogues as 'language tricks' which were subordinate to 'convincing argument' based on well corroborated evidence. The process of unmasking historical intention was not abandoned by him, but Ranke, as we have already seen, did not wish to impose the prejudice of contemporary society upon the past. That said it is important not to ignore the artistic style of Ranke's history - 'whereas the principles of research are scientific in their nature and belong to the realm of modern methodological rationality, the principles of writing history are artistic.and belong to the realm of literature'. The art of narrative gave Ranke, and still provides historians today, the 'rhetorical structures' to shape the past into an understandable present-day form. It is possible to produce a critique of those American historians that Iggers had condemned for their misconception of Rankean history based along these lines. The demand for 'research-based historiography' was 'nothing more than rhetoric itself.in order to take part in the cultural prestige of science and to legitimate the professionalism of historians, now cultivating an image of academic seriousness'. Even before Ranke arrived on the scene Wilhelm von Humbolt provided a precedent for the sentiments echoed in his work. Humbolt was convinced that 'historiography is a creative work: imitating the representation of reality'. Rusen, 'Rhetoric and Aesthetics of History', pp.90-98 Rudolf Vierhaus, 'Historiography Between Science and Art', in Iggers and Powell (eds.), Leopold von Ranke, p.4 There is a great swathe of historical argument that substantiates the belief that Ranke in fact fused the artistic, literary nature of history with empirical, scientific methodology. Rudolf Vierhaus has pointed to Ranke's own belief that 'history is at once art and science'. Yet again, we see that scientific research was little more than an instrument with which historians could produce a convincing argument. As Vierhaus put it, Ranke believed that 'the historian's greatest task.was the great comprehensive narrative'. In this sense, one might go as far as to say that he produced neither scientific nor non-scientific history, he in fact 'assigned to history a status sui generis'. To emphasise the paramount importance of artistic perspective of history, one must point out that 'historical writing.cannot be evaluated exclusively by its scientific merits but must also be examined according to rhetorical and aesthetic aspects'. These 'literary devices' are used 'to present the results of methodological historical research to contemporary readers', and there would certainly be very little argument if one were to say that Ranke epitomised these qualities. Therefore, on these grounds, it would be unfair and misguided to call Ranke the 'father of scientific history'. Vierhaus, 'Historiography Between Science and Art', pp.1-5/8 Vierhaus, 'Historiography Between Science and Art', p.6 Leonard Krieger offers a more sophisticated development of this idea. He has argued that Ranke did indeed base his history upon the foundations of sound scientific research, but that above and beyond that he adhered to higher philosophical and theological principles. Krieger has pointed out that, 'or Ranke, then, what was beyond the fact was more valuable than the fact itself', and he believes that Ranke's affinity with natural science went beyond the basic level of methodological research to the search for a 'higher principle' in 'nature and life'. However, one cannot escape the constant recurrence in his work of the 'dramatic invocation of history as the dwelling place and revelation of God'. These ideas reached 'higher than the empirical reality of discrete events'. Surely then his adherence to these abstract notions, ideas that were more important and more profoundly set in his historical philosophy, show us that he was merely concerned with scientific principle as a more precise tool than rhetoric, in particular the rhetoric of invented speech, with which to convince his audience. For Ranke, 'individual reality' and individual historical events were a 'manifestation of a universal principle', a consequence of 'laws, more mysterious and greater than one usually thinks'. Krieger, Ranke, pp.2-3 Krieger, Ranke, p.6 Krieger brilliantly and accurately surmises 'the unscientific counterpoint' that is implicit in Rankean thought. It is necessary to delve much deeper into the inner meaning of the much maligned maxim 'wie es eigentlich gewesen' and be aware of 'the problematic reinterpretation of his renowned scientific dictum'. Hence, it has become apparent that the aim to discover 'what actually happened' is not 'the objective reporting of past facts in the documents; it refers, rather, to the reconstruction of the past life behind the documents'. Therefore, the tools needed to do effectively achieve this higher duty of the historian are artistic not scientific, it requires an elegant literary narrative not an indifferent regurgitation of scientific facts. A competent historian exuded 'historical knowledge, methodological skill, aesthetic sensitivity, and moral responsibility'. It would be greatly unfair and simplistic to simply remember Ranke as 'the father of scientific history'. Krieger, Ranke, p.0 Vierhaus, 'Historiography Between Science and Art', p.5/8""","""Leopold von Ranke's historiographical legacy.""","2911","""Leopold von Ranke, a prominent figure in the field of history, left an indelible mark on historiography that continues to resonate today. Born in 1795 in the Kingdom of Prussia, Ranke is often regarded as one of the founding fathers of modern historical writing. His approach to history revolutionized the discipline, emphasizing the importance of primary sources, empirical research, and objectivity. Ranke's historiographical legacy lies not only in his methodological innovations but also in his influence on subsequent generations of historians and the enduring impact of his work on shaping historical scholarship.  Central to Ranke's historiographical legacy is his commitment to primary sources. He believed that historians should base their interpretations on direct engagement with original documents rather than relying on secondary sources or interpretations. This focus on primary sources was a groundbreaking departure from the speculative and often biased historical writing that characterized earlier periods. Ranke's meticulous attention to archival research set a new standard for historical scholarship, prompting historians to delve into archives and manuscript collections to unearth the raw material of the past.  Ranke's emphasis on empirical research was another key aspect of his historiographical approach. He advocated for a rigorous and systematic examination of sources, advocating for a methodical analysis of evidence to reconstruct the past as accurately as possible. By prioritizing empirical evidence over conjecture or preconceived ideas, Ranke sought to provide a more objective account of historical events. This commitment to empirical research laid the groundwork for a more scientific and evidence-based approach to history that continues to shape historical methodology today.  Central to Ranke's legacy is his belief in historical objectivity. He argued that historians should strive to present the past as it actually happened, free from personal biases or ideological agendas. Ranke's call for objectivity challenged the prevailing notion of history as a subjective and interpretive endeavor, encouraging historians to approach their work with a commitment to impartiality and fairness. While achieving complete objectivity in historical writing is a contentious issue, Ranke's insistence on the importance of striving for neutrality remains a guiding principle in contemporary historical scholarship.  Ranke's historiographical principles had a profound impact on the practice of history in the 19th century and beyond. His commitment to primary sources, empirical research, and objectivity set a new standard for historical writing, influencing generations of historians to come. Ranke's belief in the importance of telling history """"wie es eigentlich gewesen"""" (as it actually happened) resonated with scholars seeking to uncover the truth of the past without distortion or bias. This commitment to historical accuracy and integrity continues to inspire historians striving to uphold the highest standards of scholarship.  One of the enduring aspects of Ranke's legacy is his influence on the development of national history. Ranke played a key role in shaping the emerging discipline of national history, which focused on the unique historical trajectory of individual nations. By highlighting the distinctiveness of national histories and their significance in shaping collective identities, Ranke contributed to the growth of historical studies that emphasized the importance of national narratives. His work paved the way for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between individual nations and the broader currents of world history.  Ranke's impact on historical scholarship extended beyond his methodological contributions to encompass his broader vision of history as a discipline. He saw history as a dynamic and evolving field that could shed light on the complexities of human experience and provide insights into the present. By emphasizing the relevance of history to contemporary society, Ranke sought to bridge the gap between the past and the present, encouraging historians to draw connections between historical developments and current events. This holistic approach to history has had a lasting influence on the way historians conceptualize their role in society.  While Ranke's historiographical legacy has been celebrated for its groundbreaking contributions to the field of history, it is not without its critics. Some scholars have raised concerns about Ranke's Eurocentric perspective and his focus on political and diplomatic history to the exclusion of other voices and perspectives. Critics argue that Ranke's approach may have marginalized marginalized groups and obscured the diversity of human experiences in favor of traditional power structures. Despite these criticisms, Ranke's legacy remains a foundational pillar of modern historical scholarship, shaping the way historians approach their research and analysis.  In conclusion, Leopold von Ranke's historiographical legacy is a testament to his enduring impact on the practice of history. His emphasis on primary sources, empirical research, and objectivity revolutionized historical methodology, setting a new standard for scholarly inquiry.

"237","""The Flexi Connector component is expected to reach its full capacity of 5/8 million units in 994, the expected demand is estimated to rise by 0% per year Three alternative options are presented and analysed. Option - involves expansion of the Santa Clara plant, this would lead to the NPV of -$,43,42 after years using 0% discount rate, $,49,94 using 0% discount rate and $0,15/8,00 after 0 years using 0% rate. Option - involves using an existing plant in Waltham, which yields the MPV of $,18,86 after years with 0%, $1,97,89 with 0% and $0,89,42 after 0 years with 0% Option - involves building a new plant in Ireland, this gives NPV of -$9,10,67 after years with 0%, -$5/8,96,35/8 with 0% and $2,68,09 using 0% discount rate. Based on the analysis, the detailed plan should be established for Waltham and Ireland projects since Waltham produces highest NPV after years and Ireland the highest NPV after 0 years With a detailed plan, there is a need to consider other factors apart from NPV as well, such as labour availability at the area, accessiveness of materials, or other methods such as IRR and Payback This report has been based on assumptions that there is no inventory policy, and thus the production every year corresponds exactly to the demand, up to a point when demand reaches the maximum production capacity, from this point onwards the units of sales are equal to the maximum capacity. It also assumes that all cash flows occur at the end of the respective year. Additional assumptions are stated in the appendix.A report has been required to evaluate the alternative options of increasing the production capacity of Flexi - Connector component for Compotech Industries Plc. The current plant producing this component is projected to reach its full capacity of 5/8 million units in 994. The sale is expected to rise by 0% per year. The possible alternatives to bring additional capacity of Flexi - Connector are as follows: Option - Expansion of the existing Santa Clara plant, headed up by Elisabeth Upton Expand the Santa Clara site in California to produce an additional 0 millions units annually starting from 995/8, with a cost involving $3 million. The selling price and variable costs would remain the same, with fixed cost rising from $. million to $. million in 997. Option - Using a plant in Waltham with existing equipment, headed up by David Hope The capacity of the plant would be about 5/8 million units, with a total cost of $4 million spent on renovations of the site and equipment. Selling price and variable cost remain the same, with higher fixed manufacturing costs - $. million from 995/8 to $. million from 997. Option - Build a new greenfield plant in Ireland, headed up by Jack Dunbar New site can produce up to 0 million units per year. The cost involves $ million for acquiring a site, $0 million on building the plant and additional $0 million on equipments. Selling price remains the same, but variable cost would decrease to $.95/8 per unit. Fixed manufacturing cost would be $. annually beginning in 995/8, increasing to $. million from 999. Evaluation of the NPV methodNPV method is the method of evaluating project that recognizes that the dollar received immediately is preferable to a dollar received at some future date. By taking into account the time value of money and discounting cash flows, projects can be appraised before the investment decision is made. This approach finds the present value of expected net cash flows of an investment, discounted at cost of capital and subtract from it the initial cash outlay of the project. The method has a clear decision rule to apply. In case the present value is positive, the project should be accepted; if negative, it should be rejected. If the projects under consideration are mutually exclusive the one with the highest net present value should be chosen. NPV is being most often recommended as the soundest technique for assessing alternative investment opportunities as it: - takes into account the time value of the all of the relevant cash flows irrespective of when they are expected to occur - addresses the objectives of the business: to maximise shareholders' wealth However, like other investment appraisal methods, it has limitations such as: It can be difficult to identify an appropriate discount rate, which is crucial for NPV, i.e. if the discount factor is stated too high, the NPV may come out unnecessarily negative, or if the discount rate is stated too low, all risk factors may not be included and the project maybe over appraised. Moreover, as the solution comes in dollars, the NPV does not show the percentage rate of return. I.e. A particular project may seem to give the highest NPV, but the percentage of return, in comparison of the capital initiated, may be lower than other projects. Moreover, in order to calculated NPV, cash flows are usually assumed to occur at the end of a year, which in practice is over simplistic. NPV also does not show the demand trend, whether it as downward or upward. Despite NPV having disadvantages stated above, it may be the most recommended technique. IRR is conceivable as realistic as NPV, however, the R value there is much harder to find through the method of trial and error. Moreover, unlike Payback or ARR takes into account the time factor and discounts cash flows accordingly. Thus the NPV is necessary in assessing the alternative investment opportunities, and is definitely needed in order to asses a project in advance whether it is worth considering. However it is recommended that other methods, such as Payback, ARR are used at the same time as well, to asses the attractiveness of various options from different perspectives. Net Present Value AnalysisThe NPV calculations using different discount rate and time horizons are included in Appendix and explained below. NPV using a discount rate of 0% in years horizonWhen a discount factor of 0% was used, in five years horizon, Option Santa Clara comes slightly negative, which means that the initial capital would not be recovered after years, thus it would not be recommended at this stage. Option -Waltham project as the only one comes with a positive NPV of $,18,86, since it involves the lowest initial capital. Option - Ireland project gives a clearly negative NPV value of - $9,10,67, this is due to starting a brand new project, with the highest capital among alternatives required to buy a site and acquire new equipment. From these results, the Waltham project seems clearly most attractive since it shows a relatively high NPV in relation to the size of the project and amount invested as an initial capital. However, 0% discount rate in this set of calculations may mean that the projects have been penalized, since the discount rate might have been set too high and not corresponding to the company's cost of capital. NPV using a discount rate of 0% in years horizonSince the discount rate is reduced to 0%, while the time considered remains at years, NPV in all projects should be expected to improve since the cash flow after discounting in each year should be higher. NPV for Santa Clara project would increase to $,49,94, however the NPV seems a bit low in relation to the size of the project. Waltham would further improve to $1,97,89 which remains the highest reward among alternatives. Ireland however still remains significantly negative. This is due to the plant being too expensive to establish, thus the capital is not recoverable after years. Thus when the NPV is considered at 0% in years horizon, the Waltham project still remains the most attractive one, followed by Santa Clara, while Ireland would still not be recommended. NPV using a discount rate of 0% in 0 years horizonThe demand for Flexi - Connect is expected to remain strong for at least 0 years. This demand has already outweighed the capacity of Santa Clara and Waltham since 998. Thus when the time horizon is changed to 0 years, using 0% discount rate, Waltham project with NPV of $0,89,42, comes out last. This is because it has the lowest capacity among the other two. The NPV of Santa Clara is approximately $00,00 higher than Waltham. Despite having a lower NPV value than Ireland, both Santa Clara and Waltham sites with a NPV of over $0 million seems promising. Ireland, which gave a negative value in the first two calculations, comes out best when considered in 0 years horizon. Since Ireland has twice higher production capacity and lower variable cost than other two plants, the NPV reaches $2,68,09, which seems most attractive among all projects. Since Waltham and Santa Clara have limited production capacity at 5/8 million units and 0 million units respectively, they may not be able to cater for the demand later which is expected to rise to twice their maximum capacity. RecommendationAccording to NPV rules, if the projects under consideration are mutually exclusive the one with the highest net present value should be chosen. From the analysis given above, it would be advisable to focus on Ireland and Waltham and establish a more detailed plan on these two projects, based on expectation that Flexi - Connect is expected to remain strong for at least 0 years. Santa Clara alternative would not be recommended since it involves a higher amount of capital invested in than Waltham, but in years horizon it yields a lower NPV and in 0 years horizon insignificantly higher amount. However if the Flexi Connect is expected to remain strong for longer than 0 years, Santa Clara may yield a higher NPV than Waltham since then, but this is uncertain. When comparing Waltham with Ireland, Waltham would produce an earlier payback, but after that it would not be able to satisfy a complete demand and other expansion options would need to be considered again or CIS may consider outsourcing as another option. In case of Ireland, in 0 years time it produces the highest NPV but there is a need to consider a risk factor as well since payback will not be achieved before years. Thus based on the arguments and supporting calculations included in the Appendix, there is a need to develop Ireland and Waltham projects more in detail, with the exact calculations on expenditure and other costs. ConclusionBased on the exact detailed plans, the decision can then be made on the chosen alternative with higher NPV. However, apart from NPV, other issued should be taken into account as well when making decisions, such as: Firstly it may not be advisable to invest in capacity that will be fully utilised only after yrs and idling the company considers an additional external source for keeping up the stock There is a need to consider the location of the plant, its proximity to the local market, and cost of transport to transfer components The availability of labour at the specified area, whether enough staff could be recruited to produce the component The availability of materials at that area The availability and skills of managers, and their ability to overlook additional plant With these specific points in mind, the most realistic and appropriate project with highest NPV should be chosen.""","""Investment Options for Flexi Connector""","2339","""Investment Options for Flexi Connector  Investing in the modern world is like navigating a vast ocean of opportunities, with each investment option offering its own set of risks and rewards. For the Flexi Connector, a savvy investor seeking flexibility in balancing risk and return, there are several investment avenues worth considering. From traditional stocks and bonds to alternative investments like real estate and commodities, the path to building a diversified portfolio that suits the individual's financial goals is wide and varied.  One of the most common investment options, and perhaps the bedrock of many portfolios, is equities. Stocks represent ownership in a company and have the potential for high returns but also come with higher volatility and risk. For the Flexi Connector looking to maximize growth potential over the long term, investing in a diversified portfolio of quality stocks through individual picks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be a viable option.  Another traditional asset class is bonds, which are debt securities issued by governments or corporations. Bonds offer regular interest payments and return of principal at maturity, making them a more conservative investment compared to stocks. The Flexi Connector may consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to bonds for income generation and capital preservation, especially during periods of market volatility.  Moving beyond traditional investments, real estate presents an attractive option for diversification. Real estate can offer both income through rent and potential capital appreciation over time. The Flexi Connector could explore opportunities in rental properties, real estate investment trusts (REITs), or real estate crowdfunding platforms to gain exposure to this asset class without the hassle of property management.  Commodities, such as gold, silver, oil, and agricultural products, can serve as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks. While commodities can be volatile and speculative, they can help diversify a portfolio and provide protection against economic downturns. The Flexi Connector might consider allocating a small portion of their portfolio to commodities to enhance diversification and mitigate risk.  For investors seeking further diversification and potentially higher returns, alternative investments like hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital could be of interest. These investments typically have higher entry barriers and liquidity constraints but can provide access to unique opportunities not available in traditional markets. The Flexi Connector would need to carefully assess the risks and potential returns of such investments before considering them as part of their portfolio.  In the digital age, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have emerged as disruptive forces in the investment landscape. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have garnered attention for their meteoric rise in value, they come with significant volatility and regulatory uncertainty. The Flexi Connector may view cryptocurrencies as a high-risk, high-reward investment option suitable for a small portion of their overall portfolio.  Furthermore, socially responsible investing (SRI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations have gained prominence in recent years. Investors, including the Flexi Connector, can align their values with their investments by selecting companies that adhere to sustainable practices and ethical standards. ESG-focused funds and green bonds offer opportunities to contribute to positive social and environmental change while potentially generating financial returns.  In conclusion, the Flexi Connector has a plethora of investment options at their disposal, each with its own set of risks and rewards. By diversifying across asset classes, geographies, and investment strategies, the Flexi Connector can build a resilient and adaptive portfolio capable of weathering various market conditions. It is essential for the Flexi Connector to conduct thorough research, seek professional advice if needed, and regularly review and rebalance their portfolio to ensure alignment with their financial goals and risk tolerance. Remember, no investment is entirely risk-free, and the key to successful investing lies in informed decision-making, patience, and a long-term perspective.""","741"

One of the thermometers was then placed at a height of.m with the other one remaining at a height of.m. After waiting at least minutes for the effect of thermometer lag, the IOP began. During this Weather Conditions; Calibration of the thermometers prior to the IOP: A sample period of ten minutes was used to record the temperature of the two thermometers mounted at the same height. Therefore the mean measured offset: Data obtained during the IOP:The total elapsed time recorded was 9:9:9 on the stop-clock, therefore Due to the calm conditions experienced during the IOP, all the anemometers stalled at least once. The following table shows how often each anemometer stalled during the twenty minutes of the IOP: Calibration of the thermometers after the IOP: A sample period of eight minutes was used to record the temperature of the two thermometers mounted at the same height after the IOP to check whether the thermometers were still calibrated and whether the offset had changed significantly. Therefore the mean measured offset: The offset has only changed by.1 C compared to before the IOP and therefore it can be assumed that the calibration of the thermometers has not changed. The total number of counts recorded for each anemometer is given in the following table: Analysis:The mean wind speed, U is given by; Anemometer; Since the anemometers are accurate to within and U is greater than. ms -, the accuracy of U is. Therefore, Anemometer; Accuracy of U is. Therefore, Anemometer; Accuracy of U is Therefore, Anemometer; Accuracy of U is. Therefore, Anemometer; Accuracy of U is. Therefore, Anemometer; Accuracy of U is Therefore, Anemometer; Accuracy of U is Therefore, Anemometer; Accuracy of U is Therefore, By plotting a graph of U against ln, a logarithmic profile of the wind can be obtained. A graph has been constructed showing U against ln. A straight line of best fit has been fitted. Estimating the gradient of the line of best fit,: By constructing a line of best fit, it is possible to calculate the gradient of the slope. From the line of best fit; To estimate the uncertainty in, a maximum gradient has been constructed on the graph. From the maximum gradient; Therefore the uncertainty in the slope is Since where; then the frictional velocity,. Therefore. The accuracy of is, therefore the accuracy of u is; So,. Estimating the surface drag,:The surface drag,, is given by; where; Therefore The accuracy of is proportional to the accuracy of, however. Therefore the accuracy of is; Therefore; So, Estimating the aerodynamic resistance, ra, of the layer between. and. metres:In order to calculate the aerodynamic resistance, the difference in mean wind speed,, between the two heights must be known first; Where; At.m, can be approximated by: and similarly, at.m, can be approximated by: where; Combining these two equations cancels and gives; Therefore, From this, r a, can be estimated; The uncertainty in r a is given by; Therefore, So, The mean of the measured difference in temperature between, is; Therefore, Standard deviation is given by; The standard deviation for Therefore, Standard error is given by; The standard deviation for T; Standard error is given by; Calculating the sensible heat flux, H:The surface sensible heat flux can be estimated using; where; Therefore, By combining the errors in r a and mean temperature difference, it possible to estimated the measurement error in H. Combining the standard error for and gives.17oC, multiplying this by and c p gives 40.67. This value is the uncertainty of. Whereas the actual value of is (.)(004)(.6) = 5/818.48. The value of r a and its uncertainty is. Therefore the error in H is; Therefore, From the other group, a value of was calculated. This value was; The surface energy balance equation is given by; Where; Therefore the is given by; The experimental accuracy of is; Estimating the Bowen Ratio:The Bowen Ratio, B is given by; Therefore, The accuracy of B is given by; Therefore, Estimating the roughness length, z0: From the measurements of the wind profile, it is possible to estimate the roughness length. The roughness length is given by; From the graph, The accuracy of z is given by; Therefore, So, Conclusions and Discussion:It can be seen that when studying the graph of against ln, that all the points are linear, except the two middle values that lie slightly above the line of best fit. Therefore the measurements taken do fit the logarithmic wind profile law. It appears that the two middle values are inaccurate and the other values are more accurate. However, when all these values for each anemometer are compared with how often each anemometer stalled, it becomes clear that the middle values would be more accurate as these anemometers stalled less frequently, and that all the other points are in fact out of line with the middle two values as these points represent anemometers that stalled frequently during the IOP. This means that if the anemometers stalled less frequently, the line of best fit would be somewhat higher than it is on the graph. It appears that the scatter of measurements about the log-profile are not that significantly larger, except the middle two values, than what might be expected due to measurement error, especially considering that all of the anemometers stalled at least twice during the IOP. A value for z of.7 x 0 - m was determined from the IOP results. This is.37cm and represents the roughness length for the grass length in the Atmospheric Observatory. The Monteith and Unsworth value for short grass is.cm, since the grass in the Atmospheric Observatory is not that short, it can be said that the value obtained from the experiment is comparatively accurate, even more so if the error in it's value is considered. Principles of Environmental Physics, nd Edition, 990, Monteith and Unsworth The observed lapse rate was.6 K per. m near the surface, which equates to 00 K per km. The DALR is approximately 0 K per km, therefore the observed lapse rate near the surface was much greater than the DALR. During the analysis of this experiment, it was assumed that K H =K due to near-neutral conditions. However, during the IOP, non-neutral conditions were experienced where a strong temperature gradient was found near the surface. This was due to eddies of warm air existing near the surface and not mixing with the cooler air above. This was enhanced by the light wind conditions. The eddy correlation method estimated a value of 0.0 Wm - for H, whereas the profile method predicted a value of 3.5/8 Wm -. The value estimated by the profile method is approximately half the value estimated by the eddy correlation method. Since H is inversely proportion to r a, if rh is roughly half of ra, then H will be double. This is what was found during the IOP.""","""Wind Measurement and Energy Flux Analysis""","1632","""Wind Measurement and Energy Flux Analysis are crucial components in the field of meteorology and renewable energy. Understanding wind patterns and energy fluxes is essential for various applications, including weather forecasting, climate studies, and optimizing wind energy production. This article will delve into the importance of wind measurement, explore the methodologies used for measuring wind, and discuss the significance of energy flux analysis in harnessing wind power effectively.  Wind measurement plays a vital role in meteorology, environmental studies, and renewable energy applications. The accurate assessment of wind speed, direction, and variability is essential for predicting weather patterns, assessing the potential of wind energy resources, and understanding atmospheric dynamics. Meteorologists rely on wind data to develop weather models, improve forecasting accuracy, and monitor changes in climate patterns.  Various instruments are utilized to measure wind parameters. Anemometers are widely used devices that determine wind speed, while wind vanes indicate wind direction. These instruments are often mounted on meteorological towers or installed on ground-based stations to collect real-time wind data. Remote sensing technologies such as sodar (Sonic Detection and Ranging) and lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) are also employed to measure wind characteristics at different altitudes with high precision.  Energy flux analysis is a method used to quantify the amount of energy transferred through a specific area over a period of time. In the context of wind energy, energy flux analysis helps assess the availability of wind power at a given location. By analyzing the wind speed distribution and air density, researchers and engineers can estimate the energy potential of a site for wind power generation. This information is crucial for designing efficient wind turbine systems and maximizing energy output.  One of the key advantages of wind energy is its renewable nature. Wind is a clean and abundant energy source that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. However, harnessing wind power efficiently requires a thorough understanding of wind dynamics and energy fluxes. Energy flux analysis allows researchers to assess the feasibility of wind energy projects, evaluate potential site locations, and optimize the performance of wind turbines.  In the field of renewable energy, accurate data collection and analysis are essential for making informed decisions. Wind measurement campaigns involve deploying instruments like anemometers, wind vanes, and remote sensing devices to gather detailed information on wind patterns. Data from these instruments are processed and analyzed to determine wind speed distributions, turbulence levels, and other relevant parameters that impact energy production.  Furthermore, energy flux analysis involves calculating the power density of the wind at a specific location. This information helps developers determine the suitable size and capacity of wind turbines needed to generate the desired amount of electricity. By understanding the energy fluxes in a given area, stakeholders can assess the economic viability of wind energy projects and make informed investment decisions.  The integration of wind measurement and energy flux analysis is essential for optimizing wind energy production and ensuring the sustainability of renewable energy sources. By accurately measuring wind parameters and analyzing energy fluxes, researchers and engineers can design efficient wind farms, improve turbine performance, and maximize energy output. This holistic approach not only benefits the renewable energy sector but also contributes to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change.  In conclusion, wind measurement and energy flux analysis are critical aspects of meteorology and renewable energy. By collecting accurate wind data and analyzing energy fluxes, researchers can advance our understanding of wind dynamics, optimize wind energy production, and contribute to a more sustainable future. Through continuous research and innovation in wind measurement techniques and energy flux analysis methodologies, we can harness the power of the wind effectively and transition towards a cleaner, greener energy landscape.""","711"
"6171","""Language can 'distinguish the 'human' from the animal' suggests Iain the same could apply to a system of communication reliant on a series of grunts within an early hominid culture; the only requirement would be a 'consistency with their way of life' (Tattersall, 999: 73) and may even have provided a bond within the evidenced by sign language for the deaf. However, a non-verbal system of communication could be open to misunderstanding; errors between the provider and receiver may result in misinterpretation and may restrict the number of possible gestures within the language, possibly resulting in the evolution of a spoken Mithen argues the Levallois technique may be too difficult to acquire through observation alone, without verbal instruction. As language is a form of 'displaced reference', where symbols, on this occasion words, are used to refer to objects in their absence (Davidson, 991), it proves invaluable when planning for the future. The evolution of language resulted in the ability to communicate 'potentially life-saving information' about the environment in which early humans lived (Johanson & Edgar, 996: 06). Animal movement patterns, hunting strategies and gathering techniques could be relayed to assist survival in a hostile environment; Mithen suggests such tasks would be difficult to organize without the ability to verbally communicate. An evolution in communication systems would potentially lead to success as a culture (Davidson, 991); if this is so, and the Neanderthals were capable of speech, why did they die out? Lieberman argued the better adaptation of modern humans for verbal communication might have a link with the extinction of the Neanderthals (Trinkaus & Shipman, 994). CONCLUSIONEarly arguments of whether Neanderthals could speak relied on the skull shape and reconstruction, although, loose interpretation, of the vocal tract. The discovery of the hyoid bone of the Kebara fossil was initially accepted as proof of vocal communication, however, there has since been evidence to suggest little difference between the early human fossil, the vocal tract and the oral cavity and that of members of the animal kingdom. Some researchers have considered specific areas of the brain responsible for speech; others also assign motor function to these areas, possibly explaining the diversification of stone tools around the same time of the proposed spread of a complex language. The spoken language may have developed as a more reliable form of communication to aid the transmittance of information, possibly to improve the way of life through hunting, gathering and tool-making techniques. Following this research, it is difficult to believe survival skills could be passed on in any other way than verbally, however, the physical ability of speech in Neanderthals does not necessarily prove the cognitive ability. Unfortunately, the question of whether Neanderthals were capable of speech remains unanswered.""","""Evolution of human communication systems""","577","""Human communication has evolved significantly over the millennia, shaping our ability to connect, share ideas, and collaborate with one another. From early forms of nonverbal communication to complex languages and digital platforms, the evolution of human communication systems has been a fascinating journey.  In prehistoric times, humans primarily relied on nonverbal communication such as gestures, facial expressions, and body language to convey messages and emotions. This form of communication was essential for survival, allowing our ancestors to communicate danger, form social bonds, and coordinate activities like hunting and gathering.  As human societies began to develop, spoken language emerged as a powerful tool for conveying complex thoughts and ideas. The evolution of languages enabled humans to create shared symbols, meanings, and stories, fostering cultural identity and social cohesion. Different languages and dialects also began to emerge, reflecting the diversity of human experiences and beliefs around the world.  The invention of writing around 3200 BCE marked a revolutionary shift in human communication. Writing enabled the recording of information, stories, laws, and beliefs, allowing for the preservation and transmission of knowledge across generations. Written language also played a crucial role in the development of civilizations, facilitating trade, governance, and cultural exchange.  The invention of the printing press in the 15th century by Johannes Gutenberg revolutionized communication once again, making books and information more widely accessible to the masses. This led to the democratization of knowledge, empowering individuals to educate themselves and engage in intellectual discourse.  The Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries brought about further advancements in communication technology. The telegraph, telephone, and eventually the internet connected people across vast distances, transforming the way information was shared and disseminated. These innovations accelerated the pace of globalization, shaping a more interconnected and interdependent world.  In the modern era, the advent of digital communication technologies such as social media, email, and instant messaging has further revolutionized how we interact and communicate. These platforms have enabled real-time communication, virtual collaboration, and the sharing of multimedia content on a global scale, redefining social relationships and cultural exchanges in profound ways.  Looking ahead, the evolution of human communication systems continues to unfold with the rise of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and other cutting-edge technologies. These innovations have the potential to further transform how we communicate, blurring the lines between human and machine interactions and opening up new possibilities for connection and expression.  In conclusion, the evolution of human communication systems has been a testament to our innate desire to connect and share knowledge with one another. From nonverbal cues to digital platforms, our ability to communicate has shaped the course of human history, driving progress, innovation, and cultural exchange across societies and civilizations.""","538"

The centrality of corporations and corporate power in the modern world also profoundly influences the economy and society as a whole.

It is generally agreed that no single mechanism can provide the solution to the issues presented by a separation in ownership and control. In the UK corporate governance reforms have focused on the board of directors, in particular, the non-executive director and also on institutional investors. ibid, pp.45/8 see: Elson, C.M., Director Compensation And The Management-Captured Board: The History Of the Symptom And A Cure, 996, 0 Southern Methodist University Law Review 27, 27: management-dominated, passive boards of directors are cited as the most significant problem facing public companies today Hannigan B.

In the case of non-compliance, an explanation must be provided. Listed companies are legally required to comply with the Listing Rules. However, the only sanction for non-compliance with the Combined Code itself is the reaction of the market. This reaction can range from indifference to a dramatic drop in share price.

Various corporate collapses and financial scandals have provided the catalyst for this rise to prominence. Barings Bank illustrated the need for sufficient and effective internal controls; Enron underlined the importance of honest directors with integrity and the significance of retaining independent auditors; Royal Ahold demonstrated the dangers associated with limiting the involvement of shareholders in the running of a company; and Parmalat showed that a lack of independence of board members could have potentially disastrous effects on the company. Keasey, K., Thompson, S., Wright, M., (op.cit), pp. Mallin, C.A., (op.cit.), pp.66 In 995/8 Barings Bank became bankrupt because of the insufficient internal controls on trading, one trader, Nick Leeson, amassed losses of over 5/80 million Enron used special purpose entities to conceal large losses, in 001 Enron declared a recurring loss of $ billion and a $. billion right-off of shareholders funds In 003 Royal Ahold announced that it had overstated its earnings of its US subsidiary by $00 million In 003 Parmalat went into administration with debts estimated at 0 billion after it transpired that supposed cash reserves were non-existent Following such high profile and catastrophic failings from company directors and internal systems, much of the recent development of corporate governance has been driven by the need to restore investor confidence in capital markets. In the current system in the UK non-executive directors play a critical role in assuring good corporate governance. Mallin, C.A., (op.cit.), pp.2 The role of non-executive directorsAs well as monitoring the management, non-executives are required to be satisfied 'on the integrity of financial information and that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible'. Appropriate levels of remuneration for executive directors are determined by their non-executive counterparts and non-executives also have an important role in appointing and removing executive directors. The non-executive directors are intended to consider the position of shareholders, and not to be sympathetic to the desires of executive colleagues. The Combined Code on Corporate Governance, June 006, pp. ibid Esen, R., (op.cit.), pp.03 Many directors, both executive and non-executive, see the role of non-executives as strategic rather than investigatory. In the past the non-executives have been accused of doing little more than rubber stamping managerial decisions. The existence of non-executive members on the board of directors provides no guarantee of effective monitoring and control of the management. Hannigan B., (op.cit.), pp.45/8; Company Law Review, Modern Company Law for a Better Economy: Developing the Framework, 000, URN 0/5/86, para.34 Esen, R., (op.cit.), pp.04 The limitations on the enforcement of good corporate practice by non-executivesThe system of appointment requires that 'a majority of the nomination committee should be independent non-executive directors'. However, there is no concrete guarantee that familiar associates of executive directors, who are unable exercise the impartiality required to properly uphold shareholders' interests, will not be appointed. Management often favour chief executives who occupy a similar role in another company. As a result, these non-executives 'will not monitor any more diligently than they feel they should be monitored in running their own companies and will rarely risk loosing their jobs by questioning management's decisions'. The Combined Code on Corporate Governance, June 006, para A. Esen, R., (op.cit.), pp.04 Benfield, R.E., Curing American Managerial Myopia: Can the German System of Corporate Governance Help, 995/8, 7 Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review, 15/8, pp.23 The degree of independence to be expected of a non-executive is a key issue. Appointments still mainly arise as a result of friendship or a previous business relationship with executive officers. Reservations have been expressed over the partiality of non-executive directors with existing personal ties. Non-executives can also hold several posts and it has been argued that, no matter how talented a director is, ' can't be a good watchdog if only on patrol three times a year'. Hannigan B., (op.cit.), pp.5/81 ibid NACD, Corporate Governance Survey, cited in: Esen, R., (op.cit.), pp.05/8 Non-executives who are sympathetic to the views of management and are unlikely to challenge decisions are more prone to being selected and retained. The danger is that those selected will feel indebted to the executives for having chosen them and will be more inclined to accommodate management by unquestioningly accepting their actions. Esen, R., (op.cit.), pp.04 Non-executives may find they lack the necessary information in order to correctly monitor the actions of managers. Often managers control the quality, timing and volume of information released to non-executives. As a result information reaching non-executives can be distorted, inaccurate or insufficient. The Combined Code attempts thwart this practice by providing that information should be released in a timely manner and be of such quality that non-executives are able to discharge their duties. ibid see: Dent, G.W., Jr., The Revolution in Corporate Governance, the Monitoring Board, and the Director's Duty of Care, 981, 1 Boston University Law Review 23Revolution in Corporate Governance, the Monitoring Board, and the Director's Duty of Care, The; The Combined Code on Corporate Governance, June 006, para A. Resignation is a course of action often favoured by non-executives who oppose managerial decisions. The majority of non-executives have full time positions in other companies and therefore, would not be able to allocate the time necessary to oppose managerial decisions. Resignation seems to be a particularly inadequate method of exerting pressure on the management and is not a desirable means of ensuring good corporate governance. Esen, R., (op.cit.), pp. 04 Hannigan B., (op.cit.), pp.5/81 Monitoring is expected to run throughout a non-executive's term of office and not just in times of crisis. Nonetheless, the courts have expressed a reticence to impose too stringent a requirement on non-executives. It is felt, inter alia, that too high an expectation would result in no well-advised individual possibly agreeing to become a non-executive director. Business Week, Lessons From Boardroom Dramas, rd February 993, p. 34, cited in: Esen, R., (op.cit.), pp.03 Re Continental Assurance Company of London plc. WL 20239, per Park J., at para.10 ibid In theory impartial members of the board who examine the workings of the company from an insider's perspective are good enforcers of corporate governance. In reality non-executives are not always independent, have significant pressures on their time, are unlikely to be overly critical of the approach taken by management and lack the necessary influence to resist poor managerial decisions. The role of institutional investorsDue to the size of institutional investors they have the ability to influence the actions of companies and these investors are seen as crucial to realizing good corporate governance. Institutional investors are expected to scrutinise company management on behalf of themselves and smaller shareholders. The Institutional Shareholders' that institutions monitor performance and satisfy themselves that the investee company's board is effective. Institutional investors will normally consult reports published by the industry as well as undertake their own research to be sure that companies are complying with good governance recommendations. The ISC's aim is to identify problems at an early stage to limit impact on shareholder value. Keasey, K., Thompson, S., Wright, M., (op.cit.), pp22 see: Combined Code 006, para D.; the Cadbury the Hampel clearly emphasised the roles of institutional investors Institutional Shareholders Committee, The responsibilities of institutional shareholders and agents - statement of principles, 992, pp. ibid, pp. Mallin, C.A., (op.cit.), pp84 Institutional Shareholders Committee, (op.cit.), pp. Institutional shareholders can show their dissatisfaction with management through an 'exit' or 'voice' framework. Normally institutional investors will seek to resolve any contentious issues with management through discussions. Abstention from voting on, or voting against, a particular issue is a further extension of the exercise of an institutional investor's 'voice'. The ISC recommends the use of dialogue, but does not preclude the sale of shares where this would be the most effective response to concerns. Institutional investors are also in a position to intervene where they feel that it is necessary to do so. Intervention can take several forms, including, public statements or calling extraordinary general meetings. see: Hirschman, A.O., Exit, voice, and loyalty: responses to decline in firms, organizations, and states, 970, Harvard University Press, London, pp. Mallin, C.A., (op.cit.), pp85/8 Institutional Shareholders Committee, (op.cit.), pp. Mallin, C.A., (op.cit.), pp85/8 The limitations on the enforcement of good corporate practice by institutional investorsAsking institutional investors to monitor and control management on behalf of all shareholders in the firm can present fundamental problems. There are questions as to how willing or capable institutions are to actively govern corporations. It has been argued that 'institutions, at least on an individual basis, to devote resources to active monitoring'. This could be as a result of the fact that institutional shareholders are offered protection by the liquidity of the markets and can largely afford to be 'uninterested in all but the most substantial abuses'. Keasey, K., Thompson, S., Wright, M., (op.cit.), pp.8 ibid ibid, pp. Institutional shareholders invest money on behalf of their own clients. The interests of these clients do not necessarily run parallel to those of other shareholders or stakeholders in the business. Large institutional investors may actively seek preferential treatment over other shareholders. Where these investors own equity with superior voting rights they may seek to avoid paying out cash flows on a pro-rata basis and instead pay themselves special dividends. ibid Clarke, T. (ed), Corporate Governance: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management, Volume II, 005/8, Routledge, London, pp25/8 ibid, pp26 Problems of expropriation of smaller shareholders could be compounded where the institution is a different type of investor. For example, if the institutional investor is an equity holder it could use its position to compel the firm to take on risk, 'since shares in the upside while the other investors, who might be creditors, bear all the costs of failure'. It can be argued that, 'while this governance structure may control managers, it leaves potential minority investors unprotected and hence unwilling to invest'. ibid, pp27 ibid, pp28 Takeovers as a mechanism for corporate governanceTheory, as well as evidence, suggests that hostile takeovers are an effective means of ensuring a company is well managed. Firms which are taken over are normally undervalued, which often reflects poor performance. Following acquisition, the new owner will typically remove the poorly functioning management. Takeovers have, therefore, been argued to be a crucial corporate governance mechanism. However, the significant cost of a takeover means that only companies with major performance failures are likely to be involved. see: Scharfstein, D., The Disciplinary Role of Takeovers, 988, Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 5/8, No. 82, 5/8; Jensen, M.C., Takeovers: Their Causes and Consequences, 988, The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol., No., 1 see: Jensen, M.C., 993, (op.cit.) Clarke, T. (ed), (op.cit), pp.3 Problems with the regulation of corporate governance Many commentators believe that 'the current institutional restraints on managerial behaviour. are simply inadequate to prevent corporate assets from being used in ways dictated by the managerial interest'. One suggested reason for this is the lack of sanctions behind the provisions of the Combined Code. At present, the only result of non-compliance will be the response of institutional shareholders and the market itself. Only in the most serious cases of managerial ineptitude or self-interest is there likely to be a reaction. Keasey, K., Thompson, S., Wright, M., (op.cit.), pp. Arguably any meaningful market test is only likely to apply to small firms. The cost to a 'free' market capitalist society of a large corporation going into administration is too great for the government to endure. The government loan which bailed out British Energy in 002 provides a good example of certain companies being 'too large to fail'. Therefore, the only realistic restraint on the management in large firms is the threat of hostile takeover. Monks, A.G. & Minow, N., Corporate Governance, Third Edition, 004, Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, pp.9 ibid Takeovers, institutional investors and non-executive directors all appear to be mechanisms which will detect and react to cases of gross mismanagement but which do not look closely enough or are indifferent to less serious managerial excesses. Why are there no legal sanctions? The scandals of the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, provoked immediate demands for legal change. However, using the law to regulate the financial industry 'is not always the panacea hoped for'. Compromises built into the law, inadequate solutions or inadequate resources for policing may be factors preventing the law from exercising effective control. The fear is also that companies would be able to easily adapt to the law and use techniques such as creative accounting to circumvent new rules. McBarnet, D., After Enron: corporate governance, creative compliance and the uses of corporate social responsibility, in: O'Brien, J., Governing the Corporation, 005/8, John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, pp.13 ibid For this reason, principles, rather than specific rules, have been adopted as the most desirable means of regulating the ever adapting corporate sector. This will better serve to see the spirit of the law respected, rather than the use of techniques to thwart the actual letter of the law. ibid ibid, pp.20 Conclusion Corporate governance regulation is still in its infancy; however, there is no doubt that it 'is an economic necessity, a political requirement and a moral imperative'. The foundations of a reliable system have been laid and continued development of the roles of non-executives and institutional investors are the most desirable direction in which to proceed. Charkham, J., Keeping Good Company: A study of corporate governance in five countries, 994, Oxford University Press, Oxford, as cited by: Mallin, C.A., (op.cit.), pp269 Internal regulation of the board through non-executives is a valuable objective. It is vital that non-executives exercise sufficient scrutiny and have sufficient independence to exert control over management. However, arguably, the most important restraint is that of institutional investors. There is an increased realisation and acceptance from institutional investors that the enforcement of good corporate practice is their role. Successful regulation in this area relies on institutional investors continuing to embrace this role and to supplement the work of non-executives through carefully monitoring, and, where necessary, applying pressure on management on behalf of all other shareholders. see: Hermes Corporate Governance Principles, 006 Companies are increasingly acceptant of the Combined Code and the Code of Best Practice. This acceptance, coupled with the willingness of institutional investors to control management, means that there is no need for prescriptive and inflexible laws. As institutional investors continue to increasingly adapt to their role, monitoring and pressure on the board will increase, and better corporate governance practices will result. It is vital to avoid the repetition of past damaging financial scandals. Should the current system fail to sufficiently regulate excessive managements, legal regulation should be considered. Meanwhile, the system should be subjected to continued review and institutional shareholders and the market itself should be encouraged to participate as much as possible.""","""Corporate governance and investor confidence.""","4364","""Corporate governance plays a crucial role in maintaining investor confidence, which is essential for the effective functioning of financial markets and the overall economy. It encompasses the mechanisms, processes, and relations by which corporations are controlled and directed. When corporate governance is strong and transparent, investors are more likely to trust in the integrity of the companies they invest in, leading to increased investment and economic growth.  One of the key aspects of corporate governance is the composition and independence of the board of directors. A board of directors acts as a fiduciary for shareholders, overseeing management and making strategic decisions on behalf of the company. Investors tend to have more confidence in companies with a diverse board that includes independent directors who can provide unbiased oversight and hold management accountable. Transparency in board appointments, succession planning, and evaluation processes are also crucial in enhancing investor trust.  Another important element of corporate governance is the alignment of interests between shareholders and management. Investors are more likely to have confidence in companies where executive compensation is tied to performance metrics that are aligned with shareholder interests. This ensures that executives are incentivized to make decisions that benefit the long-term value of the company rather than short-term gains at the expense of shareholders.  Financial transparency and disclosure are fundamental to investor confidence. Companies that provide accurate, timely, and easily understandable financial information inspire trust among investors. This includes regular financial reporting, clear communication of risks and uncertainties, and adherence to accounting standards and regulations. Companies that engage in unethical practices such as financial fraud or misleading disclosures risk losing investor confidence and facing severe consequences in terms of reputation and market value.  Effective risk management is another critical aspect of corporate governance that influences investor confidence. Companies that have robust risk management processes in place are better equipped to identify and mitigate potential risks that could impact their financial performance. By demonstrating a proactive approach to risk management, companies can instill confidence in investors that their investments are being safeguarded against unforeseen events.  Ethical behavior and corporate social responsibility (CSR) also play a significant role in shaping investor confidence. Companies that prioritize ethical conduct, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility are more likely to attract socially conscious investors who value transparency and integrity. By engaging in CSR activities and maintaining high ethical standards, companies can build long-term relationships with investors based on shared values and mutual trust.  In recent years, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have gained prominence in the realm of corporate governance. Investors are increasingly considering ESG criteria when making investment decisions, as they recognize the impact of sustainability and ethical practices on long-term financial performance. Companies that integrate ESG considerations into their governance practices are viewed more favorably by investors seeking to align their investments with their values.  Overall, corporate governance plays a fundamental role in fostering investor confidence by promoting transparency, accountability, ethical behavior, and alignment of interests between stakeholders. Companies that prioritize strong corporate governance practices are more likely to attract and retain investors who value trust, integrity, and long-term sustainability. By upholding high standards of governance, companies can not only enhance investor confidence but also contribute to the stability and resilience of the financial system as a whole.""","616"
"19","""The Enlightenment, an important feature in most written works on the origins of the French Revolution, has often been credited with the ideology that inspired the French masses to rise up against the monarchy. Though the association has been made, there is nevertheless no direct causal link between the 'siecle des lumieres' (the century of light) and the revolution. Other factors were present, along with the influence of the Enlightenment, which created the context in which the revolution occurred. To provide a satisfactory answer to the above question, the writer will attempt firstly to examine the ideas of the Enlightenment, and how it contributed to the Revolution; secondly the other factors that culminated in the Storming of the Bastille on the 4 th of July 789 will be placed under scrutiny; and finally, an alternative interpretation of the relationship between the Enlightenment and the Revolution will be considered. According to the Oxford Dictionary, the Enlightenment was 'a European Intellectual movement of the late 7 th and 8 th centuries emphasising reason and individualism.' 'Man is the single term from which all must be brought back' or as Professor Colin Jones puts it 'human value was the critical yardstick of knowledge employed.' Eric Hobsbawm saw the Enlightenment as being dominated by 'a secular, rationalist and progressive individualism' in which its main objective was to free the individual from the bonds of traditionalism, superstition and an irrational hierarchical class order. The cult of the individual may have led to the estrangement of the self from the Church, (seen as an oppressive and stifling body with traditional rituals and rigid beliefs) hence the dominance of secularism in the ideas of the Enlightenment. Proceeding from there, the criticisms aimed at the Church would have led some to question the basis of its power, and the resultant decrease in its prestige and inviolability. Since the monarch was seen as God's ordained agent on earth, any challenge to the supremacy of the Church would only serve to de-stabilise the King's position as an absolute monarch, which was precisely what happened in the representation of the monarchy in the minds of the French, and made them think of themselves as victims of a despotic monarch. Thus, in Roger Chartier's words, regardless of the intent of the 'philosophical books', it succeeded in producing an 'ideological erosion' that may have made the revolution inevitable. According to Darnton, even though the people did not call for a Revolution or foresee 789, unconsciously however, they prepared for that event by 'desanctifying the symbols and deflating the myths that made the monarchy legitimate in the eyes of its subject.' The increased criticisms of the established have therefore poisoned the mentality of the Public Opinion in France that eventually led to revolution. The Encyclopedie also aspired to embody 'the power to change men's common ways of thinking' so as to make a 'revolution.in the minds of men and the national character.' Hence the fostering of the 'critical spirit' amongst the French was also an important consequence of the Enlightenment Roger Chartier, 'Do books make revolutions?' The French Revolution in Social and Political Perspective, ed. Peter Jones, (New York, 996), p. 68. Robert Darnton, 'A Clandestine Bookseller in the Provinces,' in his The Literary Underground of the Old Chartier however, cautions against this link between philosophical works and revolutionary thought. Using the example of Rousseau, Chartier illustrates the popularity of the philosophes amongst the sans culottes, middle classes and the aristocracy. Moreover, one of the Enlightenment's crowning glories, the Encyclopedie was too expensive to be purchased by anyone other than the notables, and though some were dedicated to the revolutionary cause, the majority was apathetic or hostile to it. Due to the fact that there can be many interpretations to a book, hence, it is impossible to credit too direct a role to books in creating the revolutionary ardour of the French masses. Furthermore, the philosophes were from quite a diverse social background. Rousseau's father was a watchmaker, Voltaire was the son of a notary, and Montesquieu was 'a magistrate in the parlement of Bordeaux, a feudal lord living in a moated castle and an apologist for noble power.' Most of in the idea of the monarchy as the generator of utilitarian reform, and despite the criticisms of the monarchy and traditional institutions, the philosophes believed that 'the modern state could be improved as it stood.' Perhaps, it was the failure of 'Enlightened Despotism', which resulted in the bourgeoisie transfer of faith from the monarchy to the masses, which led indirectly to the French revolution. William Doyle, The Oxford History of the French Revolution, (Oxford, 002), p.0. Colin Jones, The Great Nation, p.21. Amongst the other factors that contributed to the outbreak of the revolution, Hobsbawm suggests that it was war and debt that broke the back of the monarchy. He explains that the bankruptcy of the government and the resultant need for tax reforms gave the aristocracy and the parlements a chance to barter with the government. In exchange for the tax reforms, the aristocracy wanted an extension of their privileges, and this led to the forming of the assembly of notables and the calling of the Estates- fallen, there was no turning back. Hobsbawm, The Age of Revolution, p.8. In Roger Chartier's article he puts forward and alternative interpretation of the relationship between the Enlightenment and the revolution. He contemplates the possibility that it was not the Enlightenment that implied revolution, but rather, the converse, that it was the latter that constructed the former. He states that the retrospective construction were many-the 'canonisation' of Voltaire and Rousseau, by the revolutionary assemblies, as the intellectual fore fathers of the revolution, while others such as Buffon and Descartes were relegated; in the quest for legitimacy, political celebrations were held in Year II, honouring the philosophes and martyrs for liberty. The articles in the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expounds on the freedom of Man, may have led to the belief that it was the Enlightenment that was the ideological inspiration behind the revolution. Perhaps it was a retrospective justification for the revolution and to put the revolutionaries on a moral high ground, since they were now seen not as mere rebels, but as agents of progress. Hence, 'it was the revolution that gave a premonitory and programmatic meaning to certain works, constituted, after the fact, as its origin.' Roger Chartier, 'Do books make Revolutions', p.83. Chartier, 'Do books make Revolutions', p.85/8. The relationship between the Enlightenment and the revolution is a complex one that does not lend itself readily to simple cause and consequence explanation. There have been mutual exchanges between the two, in the sense that the Enlightenment provided the ideology and legitimacy of the revolution, and on the other hand, the revolution also gave the Enlightenment a prophetic element in that the latter 'predicted' the coming of the former and prepared the people for socio-political change. Much as the Enlightenment has contributed to the revolution, we should not discount the other forces and events that were in place for the revolution to occur, such as the economic depression that led to the politicising of the masses, the bankruptcy of the monarchy, and the personal temperament of King Louis XVI (in particular, how he was so easily manipulated by his Queen and reactionary advisors). Hobsbawm has an interesting perspective to offer, in that he thinks the revolution would have occurred without the philosophes, but they 'made the difference between a mere breakdown of the old regime and the effective and rapid substitution of a new one.' Perhaps we can then say that the Enlightenment was important only after the revolution had become a fait accompli, and that it made its mark on post-revolution re-construction. Hobsbawm, Age of Revolutions, p. 8.""","""Enlightenment's Influence on French Revolution""","1650","""The Enlightenment – an intellectual and philosophical movement that swept across Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries – profoundly impacted the French Revolution in the late 18th century. The Enlightenment was characterized by a focus on reason, individualism, skepticism of traditional authority, and a belief in progress and the power of human beings to change society. These principles, spread by thinkers such as Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu, and Diderot, served as a catalyst for the sweeping changes that occurred during the French Revolution.  One of the key ideas of the Enlightenment was the belief in the natural rights of individuals. Thinkers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that all people had inalienable rights to life, liberty, and property. This notion directly challenged the absolute authority of the monarchy and the aristocracy in France. The revolutionaries invoked these Enlightenment ideals to justify their rebellion against the monarchy, leading to the eventual overthrow of King Louis XVI.  The Enlightenment also promoted the concept of popular sovereignty, the idea that political authority is derived from the will of the people. This idea directly challenged the divine right of kings and laid the groundwork for the establishment of a republic in France. The revolutionary slogan """"Liberté, égalité, fraternité"""" (liberty, equality, fraternity) encapsulated the Enlightenment values of freedom, equality before the law, and solidarity among citizens.  Moreover, the Enlightenment promoted the separation of powers and the idea of a social contract between the government and the governed. Political philosophers like Montesquieu advocated for a system of checks and balances to prevent the abuse of power by any one branch of government. These ideas influenced the development of the French constitution during the revolution and the subsequent establishment of a constitutional monarchy and later a republic.  The Enlightenment also inspired revolutionary changes in the social and economic spheres. The philosophes criticized the privileges of the aristocracy and the clergy, arguing for a more meritocratic society based on individual talent and hard work. These criticisms fueled popular discontent against the feudal system and the outdated social hierarchy, leading to the abolition of feudal privileges and the redistribution of land during the Revolution.  Furthermore, the Enlightenment contributed to the secularization of society by promoting reason over faith and questioning traditional religious beliefs. Voltaire and Diderot, for instance, championed religious tolerance and criticized the influence of the Catholic Church on political and social life. The revolutionaries sought to create a more secular state, leading to the nationalization of church lands and the adoption of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which placed the clergy under state control.  In addition to its influence on political and social structures, the Enlightenment had a profound impact on culture and education in France. The philosophes encouraged the spread of knowledge and the development of critical thinking skills through education. The establishment of secular schools and the publication of encyclopedias aimed to make knowledge accessible to all citizens, empowering them to participate more actively in public life.  In conclusion, the Enlightenment's ideas of reason, individual rights, popular sovereignty, and social progress were instrumental in shaping the ideals and goals of the French Revolution. The revolutionaries drew upon these Enlightenment principles to challenge the traditional authority of the monarchy, establish a more democratic system of government, and advocate for social and economic reforms. While the French Revolution had its own complexities and contradictions, its roots in the Enlightenment demonstrate the enduring influence of intellectual thought on historical events and the power of ideas to shape societies.""","698"
"73","""The French labour movement is typified as 'contestatory' and as embodying an ideologically and politically divided trade union secondly, because divisions in the union movement can have a negative impact on trade union hence, the entire industrial relations system. The main trade union confederations in France are the CGT, the CFDT, the FO, the CFTC, the CFE-CGC and UNSA, though it is acknowledged that the FEN and the US-GdD are influential trade unions, primarily in the public sector. The traditional ideologies or organising principles of the main confederations are communist, socialist-centre, socialist-syndicalist, Christian, centrist and independent essay will focus on the inter-confederal ideological divisions of the CGT and CFDT, firstly, because the most marked divisions, and indeed alliances, in the French trade union movement are attributable to the CGT and the thirdly, because the CGT and the CFDT have traditionally 'unlike other trade union confederations, seen themselves as actors in the political sphere' (Brigdford 991:). The period under analysis is from 970 until the present day, whilst acknowledging that divisions were significant prior to this identified itself with mass and class 'maximalist demands would heighten the sense of injustice, raise expectations, and spur activism' (Moss 987:39). The CGT's ideology in the 970s focused on the 'fight against capitalism and imperialism' (Verberckmoes 996:1) and it has been argued that union strategies and industrial practice consistently supported the union's its failure to convert 'its ideal of self-management into social relations' (Verberckmoes 996:8). Furthermore, the CFDT endeavoured to distance itself from the political sphere following self-criticism for its support for the French Socialist the 970s and early 980s. Conversely the CGT, until recently, maintained direct links with the PCF and it's 'ideological position has remained closely wedded to the Communist Party' (Financial Times 999). The PCF has traditionally maintained considerable control over CGT strategy, influencing both trade union response and mobilisation. The CGT has criticised the 'reformism' of the CFDT and, despite suggestions of a modification of is evidence to suggest that the CGT, at the confederal level at least, continues to embody an ideology that emphasises the struggle of workers, thus following a strategy centred on protest and mobilisation. This evidence is discussed below. Firstly, however, it is important to note that 'in terms of ideology, the two confederations unmistakably moved closer together and their strategies converged' during the it is argued that with the 'recentrage' of the CFDT in 978 ideological divisions intensified throughout the 980s and 990s. Firstly, there has been inconsequential evidence of inter-confederal secondly, 'as of 980, the French labour was splintered into competitive organisations divided by politics and strategy' (Daley 999:69). Furthermore, it could be argued that the increasingly moderate stance of the CFDT has accentuated the CGT's radical stance. Thus, against a background of relatively consistent ideological division, is there any evidence to suggest divisions have been overcome in recent years? The EvidenceFirstly, cessation of direct links with PCF, during the CGT's forty-sixth congress in February 999, symbolises a shift in strategy and with a severing of the 'umbilical cord' linking the confederation to the PCF permits the union to pursue its objectives with greater portrayal of the strike as an 'archaic tool' (Daley 999) continues to separate the unions' on ideological grounds. Secondly, in June 998 the CGT and the CFDT held joint talks to encourage inter-confederal unity. The CFDT's 'olive branch' was accepted by the the confederation 'exchanged ideas from conference documents, while respecting the other's identity, in order to deepen their respective approaches to the concept of trade unionism' (Bilous 998:). In spite of the apparent strengthening of ties between the CFDT and the CGT, it is argued that 'no assumptions should be made, as union alliances fluctuate according to the issue at hand' (EIRO 999:). The discussion above highlighted the contingent nature of inter-confederal unity and, whilst the 970s unity was facilitated by the political unity of the left, recent unity is presented, firstly, as an outcome of the introduction of working time legislation which has strengthened the presence of unions and secondly, as a result of the trade unions' desire to increase membership. Thus, the recent united front is not a significant indication of a discontinuity of inter-confederal ideological divisions. Thirdly and finally, MEDEF's proposed 'overhaul' of the French industrial relations system has recently demonstrated the fragility of joint action between the CGT and the CFDT and the continuation of ideological divisions. For instance, the 'employers confederation succeeded in splitting the fragile trade union pact three times and was able to strengthen what appears to be a budding alliance with the CFDT' (Rehfeldt and Vincent 001:). The CFDT's willingness to make agreements with MEDEF has serious implications for the recent inter-confederal unity evidenced above and makes explicit the 'reformist' nature of the CFDT. The CGT has been and is vehemently opposed to any agreement with MEDEF and appears to be adopting a strategy of protest and 'mobilisation at any price' (Segrestin 987:08). Whilst the CFDT has adopted its traditional strategy of 'coping with the issues' through concessionary bargaining and a relative aversion to mass mobilisation, it is proposed that the CGT has continued to 'support the rank-and-file' acting as a 'vigilant watchdog, a powerful combat force ready to press workers' demands'. Therefore, this evidence reflects persistent ideological divisions between the CFDT and the CGT. Furthermore, this evidence develops the above discussion on the divergent approaches to the 'hows of union struggle' and it is argued that the CGT continues to be 'the most maximalist in the formulation and the negotiation of demands' and it is 'the level and not the type of demand that makes it anti-capitalist' (Ross 987:39). The CGT's calls for mass mobilisation are incessant and, whilst admitting that the CFDT has engaged in mobilisation, the confederation appears to favour agreement and negotiation with employers, whilst the CGT appears to advocate wider political objectives and raising consciousness of the struggle of and ChangeEvidence of moderation in the traditional ideologies of the CGT and the CFDT is thus ambivalent and the divisions persistent. It is acknowledged, however, that the neutral leadership of the CGT has recentred strategy, at the confederal level, in order to 'allow as many members to identify with it as possible' (Rehfeldt 999:). The focus on protest is maintained but with the need to build up a membership base, it appears that the CGT is outwardly upholding an increasingly moderate stance in order to enhance its position in relation to other unions, Europe and, more significantly, to its current and potential members. Recognition of the 'French this ideology, consistently espoused by French employers, has reinforced the CGT's oppositional ideology and encouraged oppositional behaviour from other confederations. The preceding discussion highlights the conclusion that traditional ideological divisions have not been overcome and this is apparent in the disunity of the CFDT and the CGT and the divergent strategies, objectives and values espoused by the unions. The implications of this conclusion are that unions will continue to diverge and further institutionalisation by the state will reinforce divisions as unions lack incentive to alter their behaviour due to assumptions of representivity and the extension of collective bargaining agreements. If representivity rules are changed, a collective political project may develop as unions seek to prove their legitimacy and their ability to represent an increasingly fragmented workforce. It is certain, however, that ideological divisions continue to split the French union movement and this is exemplified in the preceding discussion. The emphasis throughout has been on ideology at the confederal level as an analysis of the ideology of workers and the motivations for joining particular trade unions are beyond the scope of this essay. Nevertheless, it is recognised that 'ideological divisions affect rank-and-file practice only to a limited degree' (Segrestin 987:999) and that the ideologies' and wider political interests of the CGT and the CFDT are not automatically generalisable to rank-and-file members. Furthermore, a limitation to the above argument is the difficult nature of identifying specific ideological motivated strategies, objectives and values.""","""French Labour Movement Ideological Divisions""","1801","""The French labor movement has a rich history characterized by ideological divisions that have shaped its evolution over time. These divisions have arisen from differing beliefs about how best to represent and advance the rights and interests of workers. Understanding these ideological differences is crucial to grasping the complexity of the French labor movement and its impact on society.  One of the fundamental ideological divisions within the French labor movement is between reformism and revolutionary syndicalism. Reformism advocates for incremental changes within the existing system, such as through negotiations with employers and government bodies to improve working conditions and wages. This approach is often associated with mainstream trade unions like the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), which seek to address workers' issues through established channels and legal frameworks.  On the other hand, revolutionary syndicalism takes a more radical stance, rejecting collaboration with employers and the state in favor of direct action and the eventual overthrow of the capitalist system. This perspective is rooted in the principles of anarcho-syndicalism and has been historically championed by organizations like the Revolutionary Confederation of Labor (CNT). Revolutionary syndicalists believe in the power of workers' solidarity and direct confrontation to achieve societal transformation.  Another significant ideological division in the French labor movement is between Marxism and anarchism. Marxism, influenced by the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, emphasizes the role of class struggle and the eventual transition to a classless society. Marxist trade unions like the CGT historically aligned with leftist political parties to pursue social reforms and workers' rights within a capitalist framework.  Anarchism, on the other hand, rejects centralized authority and hierarchical structures in favor of decentralized, self-managed forms of organization. Anarcho-syndicalist groups in France, inspired by thinkers like Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, advocate for grassroots activism and the creation of autonomous worker-controlled institutions. These anarchists view the state as inherently oppressive and seek to build a society based on voluntary cooperation.  The ideological divisions within the French labor movement have led to various strategies and tactics being employed to achieve labor rights and social change. While reformist factions may focus on legislative reforms and collective bargaining, revolutionary syndicalists and anarchists may prioritize direct action, strikes, and solidarity networks to challenge existing power structures.  Despite these ideological differences, the French labor movement has historically demonstrated a capacity for unity and collective action in moments of crisis or shared goals. Solidarity across ideological lines has been key in securing victories such as the implementation of the 35-hour workweek and improved workplace safety standards.  In conclusion, the French labor movement's ideological divisions reflect diverse perspectives on how best to advance workers' interests and transform society. These divisions are not only a source of debate and conflict but also a driving force for innovation and resilience within the labor movement. By recognizing and navigating these ideological differences, labor activists can engage in fruitful dialogue and collaboration to build a more just and equitable future for all workers.""","590"
"3022","""Emotional labour has become an important component in the delivery of service quality. The behaviour of front-line employees can make or break the experience of customers. This is especially important in industries where service is the only component that distinguishes one business from another. Having employees who are willing to perform emotional labour in order to give the guests a good experience has become a crucial competitive advantage. Globalisation has added another challenge in the delivery of good service. As the industry is becoming more culturally diverse, it is important to be aware of this diversity and its implications. On the one hand customers might be expecting the same service they would receive in their home country when they are abroad. On the other hand the workforce is becoming more and more diverse and rules and regulations that work in one country might be difficult to implement in others. The aim of this article is to investigate if specific national cultures perform emotional labour with more ease in service encounters than others. In order to do this, the perceived behaviour of the employees in the Disney theme parks in the United States and France will be analysed. The notion of emotional labour and its impact on service quality will be discussed. The work culture of the Disney theme parks in both the United States and France will be explored and the different attitudes of the employees there will be examined. The reasons behind the different behaviour will be analysed in regards to cultural differences. Characteristics of French and American employees will be given. The findings will be discussed and the question if specific national cultures perform emotional labour with more ease than others will be answered. Emotional labourEmotional labour has been defined in different ways: 'Emotional labour is labour that requires one to induce or suppress feelings in order to sustain the outward countenance that produces the proper state of mind in others' (Hochschild, 983; p: ). Morris and Feldmann on the other hand defined emotional labour as 'the effort, planning and control needed to express organizationally desired emotion during interpersonal transactions' (996; p: 87). The concept of emotional labour was first introduced by Hochschild in a study of the emotions required by bill collectors - putting pressure on the debtors - and airline crew members - being friendly to the customer. She demonstrated the expectations of emotional labour from employees who are in direct contact with the public. In order to guide the employees through these interactions, many companies implement so called display rules: 'Display rules are directed to what people should try to appear to feel, irrespective of what they actually feel' (Abiala, 999; p:09). Through these rules the management governs the behaviour of the employees during customer contact: The staff is required to perform emotional labour. Bolton and Boyd explained that through using the word 'work', or in this case labour, 'it stresses that it is something that is done actively to feelings' (Bolton and Boyd, 003; p: 92). According to Mann there are three different states of feelings, which he used to explain when emotional labour is needed: 'emotional harmony', 'emotional dissonance' and emotional deviance' (Mann, 004; p:08). Emotional harmony occurs when the felt feelings are the same as the ones required by the display rules. Emotional dissonance is when the employees display the emotions that are expected of them, but do not actually feel them. Lastly emotional deviance explains the situation when the employees show the feelings they have, which, however, are not in accordance with the display rules. Mann explained that emotional labour mainly arises with emotional dissonance. According to Hochschild there are two ways of expressing the desired emotions: through surface acting and through deep acting. When employees perform surface acting, they outwardly show the feelings that are expected of them while at the same time they might be feeling something completely therefore Disneyland experienced having dissatisfied employees which led to a very high staff. The institutionally oriented cultures have a more firm view of what kind of behaviour and what kind of display of emotions are acceptable in public. The impulsively oriented cultures on the other hand are more reluctant to display emotions that they do not feel and therefore are more acceptant of showing negative emotions, if that is what is felt. As examples for these types of cultures Grandeyal. named the United States as a more institutionally oriented culture and France as more of a impulsively oriented culture. This view can be supported by the characteristics of the American and French that many authors have identified: Hall and Hall described Americans as 'open, friendly, casual and informal in their manner' (990; p: 77). They point out that Americans place high emphasis on being liked by other people. further in commenting that in order to leave a good impression, Americans might be inclined to display positive emotions and therefore hide contrary feelings. This carries on into the service industry, where the importance of friendliness and smiling while serving is indoctrinated into the employees. The French on the other hand are said to dislike expressing emotions that are not being felt (Grandey et al., 005/8; Hall and Hall, 990). Hallowellal. showed that the French refer to the American culture as 'la culture Mickey Mouse' (Hallowell et al., 002; p:9). They went on to explaining that many French employees dislike being told by the company how to feel, or at least what kind of emotions to display. Hall and Hall also emphasised that French employees find it harder to identify with a company and therefore can be less committed. It can be seen that there seems to be quite a difference between the American and the French culture. Therefore it can be expected that this will have an impact on the behaviour of employees in any workplace. So what kind of implications does this have in particular for the Disney company? Discussion It has been shown that Disney places a high emphasis on the behaviour of their employees and that they encourage the performance of emotional labour. The Disney Cooperation has recognised the positive correlation between good service and the perception of service quality: positive employees who are friendly and smiling make customers enjoy their visit to the theme parks and the guests will hence leave with the conviction that they have received good value for their money. In order to ensure this good experience and to control the behaviour of their employees, Disney use extensive training methods. The employees are expected to identify with the company and therefore perform emotional labour with ease. There is a high emphasis on training methods throughout the company. For the Disney Cooperation it is important that there are uniform standards of service quality in all their theme parks, may it be in the United States, Japan or France. Therefore the employees around the world are receiving the same training standards. However, as has been explained, the service quality in the parks does not appear to be the same. The training being the same implies that there has to be another reason behind this. As the parks are in different countries, it is logical to assume that the different cultures of the employees could be that reason. It has been established that culture is a key component of a person. It is what forms an individual and has a big impact on the values and believes. Therefore it is just natural that this will also have an impact on the behaviour of employees in the workplace. As has been identified by Grandeyal. the culture of a person influences their regard for emotional labour. So what does that mean for the employees of the Disney theme parks? As explained, the United States are a nation that place a big emphasis on delivering service with a smile. Therefore American employees are aware that smiling and being positive when working in the service industry is a given requirement. Through their nature of being 'open and friendly' this will be not very hard for them to achieve: emotional labour seems to come easily to them. This of course then reflects on the service quality. As has been shown, the friendly, smiling employee is a stereotype of the Disney theme parks in the United States. Customers know when they go there, they will be treated friendly: employees will be displaying positive emotions. The huge success of the parks in America seems to demonstrate that the customers perceive to be receiving good service quality, delivered by the employees. This indicates that the employees there obviously cope well with the emotional labour expected of them. The theme park in France - Disneyland Paris - shows a different picture. Customers there have complained that the employees are not as friendly as they would be expected to be by working in a Disney park. The reason for this appears to be the reluctance of the French employees to display emotions that they do not feel. As long as the felt emotions are positive, this does not affect the service encounter significantly. However, the problems start when the employees are not feeling positive - for example when they are irritated or in a bad mood. If there is a reluctance to cover up those feelings, by acting and therefore performing emotional labour, the service received is bound to leave a negative impression on the customer. Bryman stated that one of the ways that Disney is trying to ensure the good behaviour of their employees is to encourage their commitment to the company. However, as Hall and Hall explained, French employees at times have problems with identifying with their company and committing to it, which again makes them less likely to be willing to perform emotional labour for it. All this of course reflects on the experience of the customers when visiting the theme park. If the staff members there are reluctant to cover their feelings and are in a bad mood and not seem to be enjoying what they are doing, the customer will perceive the quality of the service, and therefore probably of the whole park, as negative. This behaviour can be further explained by looking at the different national cultures the staff belongs to: Since the staff in the United States are part of an institutionally oriented culture they are more willing to perform emotional labour in order to provide good customer service, which is reflected in the good service quality provided in the Disney Parks in California and Florida. The French on the other hand are from an impulsively oriented culture and are therefore less willing to follow the display rules and hide their real feelings. Hence the service provided in Disneyland Paris at times lacks the smiling and friendly atmosphere known from the theme parks in the United States. It has been shown that culture influences the willingness to perform emotional labour, which then has an influence on the quality of a service received. The perceived quality at the Disney theme parks in the United States appears to be superior to that perceived in Disneyland Paris: the employees there are friendlier and conform more with the stereotype of the 'ever-smiling Disney theme park employee' (Bryman, 999; p:0). This leads to the conclusion that American employees seem to perform emotional labour with more ease than their French counterparts. ConclusionEmotional labour has become an important component in the service industry. Managers encourage their staff to show positive feelings in order to enhance the customers' experience. This can be done either by surface acting or by deep acting. The strain on the employee is harder when performing surface acting as the true feelings have to be covered up: the person has to show feelings and behave in a way that does not correlate with the own emotions felt. It has been argued that continuous performance of emotional behaviour can lead to emotional exhaustion. However on the other hand it has been claimed that through identification with, and commitment to a company, this effect can be lessened. In order to ensure that the staff is behaving the way the organisation wishes them to display rules are implemented. These guide the employees through the customer transaction by prescribing certain behaviour. Emotional labour is especially important at times of these customer intercourses: In a competitive environment service is often the only factor that distinguished one company from another. Therefore providing good service quality and positive customer experiences gives a competitive advantage. In order to give good service though, a certain extend of emotional labour is necessary. The Disney company is very aware of this necessity. They have rigorous recruitment and selection processes as well as high training standards with the aim of having employees who are friendly, smiling and seem to be enjoying their work. This has been very successful in the theme parks in the United States, but less so in France. It was implied that the reason for this could be the cultural differences. It has been shown that different cultures react differently to the request of emotional labour and displaying 'false' emotions. The Americans, an institutionally oriented culture, place more emphasis on displaying acceptable emotions and providing service with a smile. The French on the other hand, more of an impulsively oriented culture, with a dislike of faking emotions, prefer to show the emotions that are truly felt. In the theme park industry this therefore has an impact on the behaviour of the employees, and hence the quality of the service provided. The staff members of the Disney theme parks in the United States have the reputation of always being friendly and smiling and are said to be one of the reasons of customers enjoying their visits there. The employees of Disneyland Paris in France on the other hand have quite a different reputation: They are said to be reluctant to follow the display rules set by Disney and to fake emotions just because it is expected of them. Therefore the service quality in the park in France appears to be of lower standard than in the United States. As the training provided for Disney employees is the same in both the United States and France it is logical to conclude that the reason for this must lay in the differences in the culture of the staff members. All the arguments stated above therefore lead to the conclusion that specific national cultures perform emotional labour with more ease than others, as has been shown by analysing American employees and their French counterparts.""","""Emotional labour and cultural differences""","2749","""Emotional labor is a concept that delves deep into the emotional experiences and expectations tied to one's job, particularly in service-oriented professions where managing emotions is a crucial part of the role. Cultural differences play a significant role in shaping how emotional labor is perceived, expressed, and managed across different societies. Understanding the intersection of emotional labor and cultural nuances is vital for creating inclusive and supportive work environments where individuals can navigate their emotions authentically while meeting professional expectations.  Emotional labor encompasses the effort, skill, and regulation of emotions that individuals put forth in their jobs to achieve organizational goals or expectations. It involves managing one's emotions to display specific feelings or reactions, often to meet the needs of clients, customers, or colleagues. Service industries such as hospitality, healthcare, education, and customer service heavily rely on emotional labor as part of their daily routines. This can involve displaying empathy, patience, positivity, or understanding, even when one may not genuinely feel those emotions at that moment.  Cultural differences play a crucial role in shaping individuals' understanding and experience of emotional labor. Different cultures have varying norms, values, and expectations regarding emotional expression, communication styles, and the role of emotions in the workplace. For example, cultures that prioritize collectivism may place a higher emphasis on harmony, group cohesion, and interpersonal relationships, influencing how emotional labor is performed and received. In contrast, individualistic cultures may prioritize personal achievements, assertiveness, and independence, which can impact how emotions are managed and displayed in professional settings.  In collectivist cultures such as many East Asian societies, there is often a strong emphasis on maintaining social harmony and avoiding conflict. This cultural value can manifest in the form of suppressing one's true emotions to maintain a facade of positivity or composure, even in challenging situations. Individuals may engage in deep acting, where they sincerely try to align their inner emotions with the expected display rules. This can lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout if prolonged, as individuals constantly navigate the tension between their true emotions and the desired emotional expressions.  Conversely, in individualistic cultures like those in the Western world, there may be more acceptance of expressing one's authentic emotions and perspectives. However, this can also create challenges in situations where emotional display rules clash with personal values or boundaries. Employees may feel pressured to perform surface acting, displaying the expected emotions without genuinely feeling them, leading to feelings of inauthenticity and dissonance.  The impact of cultural differences on emotional labor extends beyond individual behaviors to organizational practices and policies. Companies operating in diverse cultural contexts need to be mindful of creating environments that respect and accommodate varying emotional norms and preferences. Training programs, workshops, and awareness campaigns can help employees and managers navigate cultural nuances related to emotional labor, promoting empathy, understanding, and effective communication across cultural boundaries.  Emotional labor can also intersect with other aspects of diversity, such as gender, age, ethnicity, and social class. Different social identities can influence how individuals experience and navigate emotional labor in the workplace. For instance, research has shown that women often bear a disproportionate burden of emotional labor, expected to display nurturing, empathetic behaviors regardless of their actual emotions. This can lead to emotional exhaustion and job dissatisfaction if not recognized and supported by organizational policies and practices.  In multicultural workplaces, fostering emotional intelligence and cultural competence among employees becomes essential for promoting an inclusive and supportive environment. Encouraging open dialogue, active listening, and mutual respect can help bridge cultural gaps and cultivate a sense of psychological safety where individuals feel free to express their emotions authentically. Managers play a crucial role in modeling positive behaviors, creating clear communication channels, and addressing any conflicts or misunderstandings that arise due to cultural differences in emotional labor practices.  In conclusion, emotional labor is a multifaceted concept that is deeply intertwined with cultural differences, influencing how individuals perceive, manage, and express emotions in the workplace. By acknowledging and addressing cultural nuances related to emotional labor, organizations can create spaces where individuals from diverse backgrounds feel valued, respected, and empowered to navigate their emotions authentically. Embracing cultural diversity in emotional labor not only enhances employee well-being and job satisfaction but also contributes to the collective success and effectiveness of organizations in a globalized world.""","844"
"3140","""The present study sought to assess the nutritional status of 1 ages ranging from 2-5/8 years. The assessment methods used were anthropometrical measurements of height, weight, skinfold thickness, bioelectrical impedance, circumference and breath measurements. The study found out of the 1 participants to be within the healthy range, while one female was undernourished and one male was over overnourished, according to some of the measurements.Measurements of nutritional status are important as they can determine a persons' health status and help predict health outcomes. These measurements may be useful in deciding if and when to intervene, in order to improve the nutrition of people in danger of developing diseases caused or made worse by poor nutrition. A variety of measurements, such as dietary, anthropometric, biochemical status, and functional and clinical status muscle area by about 0-5/8% (Gibson, 002), and thus may underestimate the severity of muscle tissue loss. Waist-hip circumference ratio can be used to establish the distribution of subcutaneous and intra-abdominal adipose tissue, and is thought to be more precise than skinfold the body, as well as the chest, whereas men tend to store body fat on the abdomen. As well as gender differences, there are also age differences, in that the body tends to store more fat as one gets older. For this reason there are age- and gender- specific standards of comparison. Furthermore, when weighing adults the subject should preferably have only underwear on. However, this might in some cases, such as the present study where a whole group is in the same room, prove difficult. In such a case, one should be weighed with clothes on, and subtract -. kg from the recorded weight. Body Mass calculated using the height and weight measurements, and is the most widely used tool to assess undernutrition and overnutrition in adults. For children under the age of three there are not only different standards for comparison, but also different methods of measurement, since they cannot be expected to stand upright to be measured. The height would be measured lying in the recumbent position, using an infantometer with a moveable footboard and a fixed headboard. The height measurement would be the distance between the two boards. And for weighing, the infant is allowed to sit on a special scale while being weighed. There is also a similar scale for adults who for various reasons cannot stand up, and they can be measured an easy, non-evasive method of calculating body composition, and can be used to calculate fat free total body difficult to carry out on certain people, such as obese people, or the subjects' height was measured standing, with shoes off, with a standiometer. This consists of a metric tape fixed to a vertical pole with a moveable device which can be brought down to the crown of the head of the person, who should stand with straight back in a 'salute' position and facing straight ahead in the Frankfurt horizontal body mass index is calculated by dividing the subjects' weight by height. Skinfold thickness was measured using skinfold callipers, at the midpoint of the back of the right upper arm, with the subject standing with arms relaxed by the side. The assessor grasped a vertical pinch of skin and subcutaneous fat between thumb and forefinger, and measured this leaving the callipers on for only a few seconds. Two readings were recorded and averaged. Biceps skinfold thickness was measured in the same way as described for triceps, with the only exception being that the biceps were measured at the front of the arm, while the triceps were measured at the back. Two readings were recorded and averaged. Subscapular skinfold thickness was measured with the subject standing relaxed with arms at the sides. The assessor pinched a horizontal skinfold at 5/8 degrees, about cm below the inferior angle of the right shoulder blade. The measurement was taken with the callipers within a few seconds. Two readings were recorded and averaged. Suprailiac skinfold thickness was measured with callipers, piching a fold of skin and subcutaneous tissue at the narrowest part of the waist. The measurement was taken with the callipers within a few seconds. Two readings were recorded and averaged. Bioelectrical Impedance BIA measurement was determined with the subject lying supine on a table top. Two skin electrodes were fastened at the dorsal of the wrist, and at the dorsal surface of the ankle, and two electrodes fastened at the base of the third metacarpalphalangeal joints of the same hand and foot as the other two electrodes, leaving a space of cm between the electrodes. Black leads were fastened to the wrist and ankle electrodes, and red leads to the electrodes on the hand and foot. The subjects' age, height, weight and exercise level was typed into the BIA box, and the result recorded. CircumferenceMid Upper Arm measured at the midpoint of the back of the left upper arm using a flexible tape measure. Measurements were recorded to the nearest. cm. Measurements were taken two times and averaged. The arm muscle area can then be measured from this by the following calculation: were measured with a flexible tape measure. Measurements were recorded to the nearest. cm. Measurements were taken two times and averaged. The waist-to-hip be calculated by the following calculation: Total body calculation for BF is as follows: and for FFM: ResultsAccording to the BMI scale reported by Whitney et al. three female be classified as within the normal range with a BMI of 3., while the within the obese a BMI of 3, and is considered to be at a moderate risk of disease. The mean values of the females mostly fall within the normal healthy range, and there is not a considerable divergence. This is reflected by the standard deviations, which for most of the body measurements are relatively with wastage of muscle normal range is 7. - 0. cm with a standard deviation of. cm. For the males the mean MUAC for their age 8. with a sd of. cm, while the range of MUAC in this group is 9. - 0. cm. According to the fat mass and fat free mass in Table, there are not vary large differences between the subjects, except for one male subject who has a relatively higher score than the others. DiscussionThe waist-hip ratio cut-off point indicating a heightened risk for cardiovascular disease and death is. for men, and. for this study is above this cut-off point and thus risk of cardiovascular disease. The WHO has set the waist circumference cut-off point at >0cm signalling risk and >8 cm signalling high risk for women, and >4 cm indicating risk and > 02 cm indicating a high risk for just on the border at 0 cm. The other subjects are not considered to be at risk. One would normally expect a difference in body composition between males and females, in terms of fat distribution, fat % and muscle, as well as height and weight. However, it is not very valuable to look at the sex differences in this study, as there are only two male subjects and the variances between those two are large. This is illustrated by the standard deviations. The high sd also indicate that the mean measurements in the male group is not vary representative. The female group means, on the other hand, are more representative of their gender. The mean values of the females are not very diverging. This is reflected by the standard deviations, which for most of the body measurements are not very rather dissimilar results in this study. The reason for this may be that the BIA method requires strict guidelines to be followed. The present study was done after subjects had eaten breakfast, and they were not asked to follow the guidelines in advance, therefore this might have had an affect on the results. Another factor may be that performing skinfold measurements require experience and skill. For the majority of the assessors in this study it was their first time using this method, and the execution might not have been very accurate. Lastly it is important to point out that the anthropometric measurements have positive and negative areas, and that they should be used within the appropriate contexts. This citation from the WHO is a good indicator of this '. all physical characteristics result from the interaction of heredity and environment. Body measurements may not always be used safely for comparing the nutritional status of genetically different populations nor for an assessment of nutritional status by reference to a world standard. They are, however, useful for follow-up of physical state over periods too short for genetic selection to affect the population in a significant way, provided gene flow is negligible.' (WHO, 970, cited in Fidanza, 991). ConclusionThe study assessed a group of subjects, and found out of 1 of these to be of good nutritional health. The measurement methods were found to be reasonably quick and easy to carry out. However, the validity of results measured by first-time assessors may be questioned. And further, some of the techniques, and especially the skinfold measurements, require a lot of practice and expertise, as well as being prone to between-assessor variances. The use of the assessment as well as the situation and subjects measured must be evaluated when making a decision as to which nutritional assessment should be carried out.""","""Nutritional assessment methods and findings""","1896","""Nutritional assessment is a critical component of evaluating an individual's dietary intake, nutritional status, and overall health. It involves a comprehensive analysis of dietary habits, physical examinations, biochemical tests, and anthropometric measurements to determine a person's nutritional needs and deficiencies. By conducting a thorough nutritional assessment, healthcare professionals can identify nutritional issues, develop tailored interventions, and monitor progress towards improved health outcomes. This article explores various methods used in nutritional assessments and the findings they can reveal.  Anthropometric measurements are fundamental in assessing an individual's nutritional status. These measurements include height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and skinfold thickness. Height and weight measurements are basic indicators used to calculate BMI, which helps classify individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Waist circumference is particularly important in assessing abdominal obesity and metabolic risk. Skinfold thickness measurements, taken at specific sites on the body, can provide information about body fat distribution.  Biochemical assessments involve analyzing blood, urine, or other body fluids to evaluate the levels of various nutrients, minerals, and biomarkers. Common biochemical tests include measuring hemoglobin, serum albumin, serum ferritin, vitamin levels, and cholesterol levels. Hemoglobin levels indicate the presence of anemia or iron deficiency, while serum albumin levels reflect protein status. Low vitamin levels may suggest specific nutrient deficiencies, while high cholesterol levels can indicate cardiovascular risk.  Clinical assessments involve a thorough physical examination to identify signs and symptoms related to nutritional deficiencies or imbalances. Healthcare professionals may assess the skin, hair, nails, eyes, and mucous membranes for signs of malnutrition. Additionally, evaluating muscle mass, strength, and tone can provide insights into protein status and overall nutritional health. Clinical assessments also involve reviewing medical history, medications, and any existing health conditions that may impact nutritional status.  Dietary assessments aim to evaluate an individual's usual dietary intake, food choices, eating patterns, and nutrient adequacy. Methods for dietary assessment include food records, 24-hour recalls, food frequency questionnaires, and diet history interviews. These tools help quantify nutrient intake, identify dietary patterns, assess energy balance, and pinpoint areas of improvement. By analyzing macronutrient and micronutrient intake, healthcare professionals can tailor dietary recommendations to meet specific nutritional needs.  Subjective global assessment (SGA) is a comprehensive nutritional assessment tool that combines data from anthropometric measurements, biochemical tests, clinical observations, and dietary intake evaluations. SGA categorizes individuals into well-nourished, moderately malnourished, or severely malnourished based on overall nutritional status. It helps identify individuals at risk of malnutrition and guides interventions to improve nutritional outcomes.  Nutritional assessment findings can reveal a wide range of issues impacting an individual's health and well-being. Common findings include undernutrition, overnutrition, specific nutrient deficiencies, malabsorption disorders, eating disorders, and metabolic abnormalities. Undernutrition may manifest as weight loss, muscle wasting, fatigue, and compromised immune function. Overnutrition, on the other hand, can lead to obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders.  Nutritional assessments can also uncover micronutrient deficiencies such as iron, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and calcium deficiencies. These deficiencies can result in anemia, bone disorders, neurological impairments, and compromised immune function. Malabsorption disorders like celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and pancreatic insufficiency can impair nutrient absorption and lead to malnutrition despite adequate dietary intake.  Eating disorders like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder can significantly impact nutritional status and overall health. These disorders are characterized by disordered eating behaviors, body image disturbances, and nutritional deficiencies. Addressing these psychological and behavioral issues is essential for improving nutritional status and preventing long-term health complications.  In conclusion, nutritional assessment methods play a crucial role in evaluating and managing individuals' nutritional status and overall health. By combining anthropometric measurements, biochemical tests, clinical assessments, and dietary evaluations, healthcare professionals can identify nutritional issues, develop tailored interventions, and monitor progress towards improved health outcomes. Understanding the methods and findings of nutritional assessments is essential for promoting optimal health and well-being for individuals of all ages.""","846"
"6121","""The theories of structure and agency have been spearheaded by Anthony Giddens, a British social scientist and Pierre Bourdieu, a French anthropologist. Giddens and Bourdieu's theories have greatly affected the field of Archaeology, although Dobres and Robb call their writings 'ambiguous, often incomprehensible and incontrovertibly high-brow', their theories enable us to ask questions about the evidence of the past. Bourdieu is one of the key architects of the theories of structure and agency which are called 'inseparable'; his theory of habitus is what Jay MacLeod calls 'a regulator between individuals and their external world, between human agency and social structure'. Giddens' Structuration Theory 'challenges the way culture is portrayed in archaeology and attempts to change the analytical focus of archaeology separating will or agency from social structures'. However, MacLeod uses another line of argument; he argues that in contrast to Johnson's argument 'structural determination is inscribed in the very core of human agency'. Their ideas have given a useful insight into past societies social cohesion, archaeologists have stressed the importance of individual agency in the past, in reaction to other approaches such as culture history or environmental determinism, in which individuals and communities are sidelined.

Archaeological Theory. Oxford: Blackwell MacLeod J. 987 'Ain't No Makin' It: Aspirations & Attainment in a Low-Income Neighbourhood' Page 5/85/8 In terms of Archaeology perhaps Marx puts it best when relating agency to archaeology 'men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please, they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past', in effect Marx is saying that an individuals actions are not always intentional but can also come as a result of external factors, for example in terms of archaeology a Roman carrying a pot might trip and break the pot rather than purposely dropping it with the intention of breaking it, the broken pot is then evident in the archaeological record. Marx K. ed.963 'Das Kapital' Page 5/8 Bourdieu's builds on this with his theory of habitus, which Dobres and Robb put simply as 'the taken-for-granted routines of daily life', and MacLeod calls the 'attitudes, beliefs and experiences of those inhabiting one's social world'. This is key to the work of archaeologists; once we gain an understanding of what an individual's role in a past society was, be they a peasant or a king, we can begin to understand why an event or even a deposition occurred, from the disposal of a pot to why a country was invaded. Dobres and Robb went on to explain that once we understand habitus we can understand why 'people create and become structures and become structured by institutions and beliefs beyond their conscious awareness or direct control'. What Dobres and Robb are trying to explain is that once we have understood these 'structures' we can understand why the individual performed actions which are evident in the archaeological record.

In Dobbs, M-A & Robb, J.E. Agency in archaeology. London:Routledge Page Bourdieu's view is that society, contrary to traditional Marxism, cannot be analyzed simply in terms of economic classes and ideologies. Much of his work concerns the independent role of educational and cultural factors. Instead of analyzing past societies in terms of classes, we can use Bourdieu's concept of field: a social arena in which people manoeuvre and struggle in pursuit of desirable resources. A field is a system of social positions, structured internally in terms of power relationships. Different fields can be quite autonomous and more complex past societies clearly would have more fields. However, this is not to say that Bourdieu has gone uncriticised in his approaches to the subject, Lane questions the anthropologist's 'perceived determinism and consequent inability to account for significant historical change', if this is true then we must seriously question Bourdieu's relevance to historical analysis, Bridget Fowler goes on to add that 'Bourdieu has never undertaken any protracted discussion of transformation in the social, cultural, or political spheres'. In my opinion this is unfair, Boudieu's theory of habitus enables us to pose key questions when assessing social stratification in the past. Lane J.F. 000 Modern European Thinkers: Pierre Bourdieu 'A Critical Introduction' Pluto Press Page Bourdieu and Giddens both agree that practice theory is a 'theory of the continuous and historically contingent enactments or embodiments of people's ethos, attitudes, agendas and dispostitions', when applying this theory to archaeology we can attempt to understand a past society's motivations and beliefs through the archaeological record, we can see their attitudes to religion for example by evidence of sacrifice and then deduce their religious beliefs in different periods of time. DOBRES, M-A. & ROBB, J.E.000. Agency in Archaeology: Paradigm or platitude? In Dobbs, M-A & Robb, J.E. Agency in archaeology. London:Routledge Page 15/8 Giddens writes 'human history is created by intentional activities but is not an intended project.' This echoes Marx in his belief that 'men make their own history.but they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves' which, in principle, is key to an archaeologists understanding of the past. An individual's actions and the traces of actions that they leave in the archaeological record are not necessarily done on purpose so we, as archaeologists must ask why did they do it? Giddens A. 984 'The Constitution of Society' Page 7 Marx K. ed.963 'Das Kapital' Page 5/8 Giddens' Structuration Theory poses many questions for archaeologists, the Structuration Theory describes how social agents i.e. humans relate to social structures, how they are constrained by their social environments but pursue active strategies, the clash with agency then produces change in social structures. A Roman floor provides a suitable example of Giddens' theory in practice, linking both structure and agency. The traditional view of an archaeologist when analysing a Roman floor would be to class it as an object and then try and fit it into a typology of some sort, placed into patterns of material culture representative with a certain society and determining its status within a society. Applying Giddens' Structuration Theory we would look at the floor, and then ask questions in relation to how the floor may have interacted with a human agent. Then discuss the fact that someone had walked on the floor, the fact conversations were held in the room or even the possibility an event such as a murder may have occurred there. It would then be possible to suggest the status of the floor in the society by relating them to a general structure of society. We can apply this to past societies, in an attempt to see how and why a society changed and what actions forced it to change. BARRETT, J.C. & FEWSTER, K.J. 000. This elaborated on Bourdieu's questioning of social practice how 'people become structured by instituitions and beliefs beyond their control', further to this people are not 'omniscient, practical, free-willed economizers but rather are socially embedded, imperfect and often impractical' resulting in the final part of Giddens' Structuration Theory i.e. a clash with agency producing change in social structure. DOBRES, M-A. & ROBB, J.E.000. Agency in Archaeology: Paradigm or platitude? In Dobbs, M-A & Robb, J.E. Agency in archaeology. London:Routledge Page DOBRES, M-A. & ROBB, J.E.000. Agency in Archaeology: Paradigm or platitude? In Dobbs, M-A & Robb, J.E. Agency in archaeology. London:Routledge Page This is not to say that there are no differences in opinion between Giddens and Bourdieu, in Giddens case he attempts to combine both agency and structure while still acknowledging the fact that the two aspects are on there own where as Bourdieu's focus is on the actions of the individual, the agent or actor and then he attempts to compare these actions back to the way that the social structure has built up. Unlike Bourdieu, Giddens ignores the 'body' of the agent, something that Bourdieu stresses throughout his theory of habitus where he implies that we manipulate and change society through our actions; Giddens does not acknowledge Bourdieu's belief in the importance of the actions of individuals. Bourdieu challenges the rigid aspects of structuralism expressing his belief that Habitus can only be realised with human action; inferring that we make, change and reshape our society around us as individual agents. We can therefore see that although Giddens and Bourdieu's theories echo each other in many ways and share certain aspects, they also have their differences. Both Giddens and Bourdieu's theories have contributed greatly to the field of archaeology. When applying their theories of Structuration and Habitus respectively to a past society, we have the ability to gain a greater understanding of that society's social structure, we can place greater importance on the role of the individual in shaping history through their actions and the evidence they leave in the archaeological record.""","""Structure and agency in archaeology""","2193","""Structure and agency are key concepts in archaeology that shed light on how humans interact with their environment and shape their cultural landscape. The interplay between structure, which refers to the wider societal, political, and economic frameworks in which individuals operate, and agency, which pertains to the capacity of individuals to act autonomously and make choices, is a crucial aspect of archaeological interpretation. By analyzing the dynamic relationship between structure and agency, archaeologists can better understand how past societies functioned and evolved over time.  In the realm of archaeology, the concept of structure encompasses the overarching social, economic, and political systems that influence human behavior. These structures can be seen in various aspects of ancient societies, such as religious beliefs, economic practices, and political hierarchies. For example, the presence of monumental architecture in a region may indicate the existence of a centralized authority that could mobilize labor for large-scale construction projects. Likewise, the distribution of pottery styles across different regions may reflect patterns of trade and interaction between communities.  Structural forces can shape the everyday lives of individuals within a society. For instance, agricultural practices may be influenced by the availability of water resources or the fertility of the soil, which in turn can impact settlement patterns and social organization. In studying ancient societies, archaeologists examine the structures that govern these behaviors and seek to understand how they influence human agency.  On the other hand, agency refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make choices that can influence their social and material worlds. While structures set the parameters within which individuals operate, agency allows for variation and innovation within those constraints. Individuals can exercise agency through their daily actions, such as craft production, trade interactions, or ritual practices. By examining the material remains left behind by past societies, archaeologists can uncover evidence of individual and collective agency in the archaeological record.  The concept of agency is particularly important in challenging deterministic views of the past that emphasize the role of structural forces at the expense of individual actions. By highlighting the agency of past peoples, archaeologists can recognize their creativity, resilience, and adaptability in the face of social, economic, and environmental challenges. Through the study of agency, archaeologists can gain insights into the diversity of human experiences and the ways in which individuals negotiated their social worlds.  One of the key debates in archaeology revolves around the relationship between structure and agency. Some scholars argue that structures constrain and shape human behavior to such an extent that individual agency is limited. This perspective, known as structural determinism, posits that societal structures dictate the actions of individuals, leaving little room for autonomous decision-making. In contrast, proponents of agency emphasize the role of individual choices and actions in shaping societal structures. They argue that human agency can challenge, resist, or transform existing structures, leading to social change and innovation.  In contemporary archaeological practice, there is a growing emphasis on understanding how structures and agency interact to produce social dynamics in the past. Archaeologists aim to move beyond simplistic dichotomies and explore the nuanced ways in which structures enable and constrain human agency, and how agency, in turn, shapes and transforms structures. By adopting a more nuanced approach to structure and agency, archaeologists can develop richer interpretations of past societies that take into account the complexities of human behavior and social relationships.  One of the ways in which archaeologists study structure and agency is through the analysis of material culture. Objects such as pottery, tools, architecture, and art can provide valuable insights into the beliefs, values, and practices of past societies. By examining the distribution, production techniques, and styles of material culture, archaeologists can uncover patterns of social organization, economic exchange, and cultural interaction. Through the study of material culture, archaeologists can trace the ways in which structures and agency intersected in past societies.  Archaeologists also use various theoretical frameworks to explore the relationship between structure and agency. Concepts such as practice theory, actor-network theory, and assemblage theory offer different perspectives on how individuals and material culture interact within social contexts. Practice theory, for example, focuses on the repetitive actions and routines that shape social life, highlighting the role of individual agency in the reproduction of social structures. Actor-network theory, on the other hand, emphasizes the complex networks of relationships between humans and non-human actors in shaping social realities. By drawing on these theoretical approaches, archaeologists can analyze the entanglement of structure and agency in the archaeological record.  In conclusion, structure and agency are fundamental concepts that help archaeologists make sense of the complexities of human societies in the past. By examining the interplay between societal structures and individual actions, archaeologists can develop nuanced interpretations of past cultures and societies. Through the study of material culture, theoretical frameworks, and interdisciplinary approaches, archaeologists continue to explore the dynamic relationship between structure and agency and its implications for understanding human behavior and social change over time.""","971"

The codes and comments are written and programmed in IAR Embedded Workshop which provided the integrated development environment required. The microcontroller had two segment display devices and push button switches. The port responsible for the segments output was port P0 and the port responsible for the enabling the LED's output was port.

I used the Appendix B to determine the special function registers associated with the I/O pins used. The Appendix C for the codes given With the knowledge I had and understanding the lectures notes I wrote the codes and comments for the programs Apparatus:The hardware elements featured in the laboratories were: the microcontroller input/, segment display devices and push button switches. Firstly I connected the M16C Microcontroller board to a PC and powered up both boards. The codes and comments were written and programmed using IAR Embedded Workshop which gives integrated development environment required for creating and testing the applications. With the reference from the handouts given, the two program files Assi1.c and Assl2i.c carried out the following operations: Assi1.c- It keeps a running the LED display Assil2i.c- It contained an incomplete program for the microcontroller to number of times switch SW1 was operated and display the result.

Port. direction register is used to set the direction and port. register is used to set it low or high. When it is pressed it grounds the port making it active low. Segments display device- Port which is a bit port, is responsible for the segments display and one bit is assigned to the each segment as shown below: Port direction register is used to set the direction of the segments and Port register is used to set it pulled high or low. Here as shown in figure, OE is always active low as it is connected to ground and according to the function of 4HC244 it displays only the active low from all the inputs. Here the input is the segments. LED1 &: The connection details of the LED1 & and the port responsible for the enabling process are as shown above. The LED has an Enable pin. This is controlled by port bit for LED and port bit for LED. Port P1 direction register is used to set the direction of LED and Port P1 register is used to set it low or high. Collective working of both LED and Switch:Firstly, the direction of switch SW1 is set to input. The port responsible for SW1 is P8. and by using the Port direction, the delay variable is changed from integer to long as when high values of delay were assigned it result an error. When delay value is decreased the time, the output on the LED is displayed, became shorter, resulting the result not easily recognized by eyes. Hence, high value of delay is required in order to display the result for sufficient time to observe the results. There is also another way of changing delay, by using another loop inside delay function which carries it on for long. void increase the count value by, before it has been incremented. Suppose the value of count is, x=count+; assigns the value to x before it has been incremented. Count value is increased each time the loop is over. }- End of loop to display output on LED1 }- End mainAssl2i.cThis program is written for the M16C/2 microcontroller embedded in the Mitsubishi M16C/2 development board. Before the lab, the program contained incomplete codes for the microcontroller to number of times push button switch SW1 is operated and display the result. LED1 represents tenth place and LED2 represents unit place. After modifications, it now displays numbers from to 9 when SW1 is pressed each time. After reaching 9, the LEDs turn off when SW1 is pressed and once again when SW1 is pressed, it starts the count from again. For displaying numbers from -, the LED1 is switched off, as only LED2 is needed to display unit place.

For the first assignment, there are two methods were used to show how SW1 is used to control the rotation in different ways. The result obtained by using the st method was when SW1 was pressed only then the rotation started and when released it stopped. Under the nd method the rotation started when the program was executed, but when SW1 is pressed it stops the rotation and when pressed again it starts the rotation. In both methods, the delay function was observed and it affected the time for which the output is displayed. If the value of delay is more the more time the output is displayed meaning it gives sufficient time for the eyes to recognize the changes. For the nd assignment, when the program was executed it turned off both LEDs and when SW1 is pressed it, LED2 displays. Each time it is then pressed it shows the count from -9 on both LEDs. Though LED1 is set off when the count is under 0. When count reaches 00 it turns off both LEDs and when pressed again it starts the count from -9 again. Conclusion:From my observations, the program codes functioned as required and therefore I met all the requirement of the tasks.""","""Embedded Microcontroller Programming Laboratory""","1791","""Embedded microcontroller programming laboratories serve as vital learning environments where students can acquire practical skills in working with microcontrollers, which are at the heart of countless electronic devices. These labs provide hands-on experience in designing, coding, and testing embedded systems, preparing students for careers in fields like robotics, IoT, automotive, aerospace, and more. From basic concepts to advanced projects, the lab curriculum covers a wide range of topics essential for developing expertise in embedded systems programming.  One of the fundamental aspects of an embedded microcontroller programming laboratory is the hardware setup. Students typically work with development boards that house the microcontroller unit, along with various input/output interfaces such as LEDs, buttons, sensors, and communication modules like UART, SPI, and I2C. These components form the building blocks for creating embedded systems. Understanding the hardware architecture and connections is crucial for successful programming and troubleshooting.  In addition to hardware, the laboratory is equipped with software tools necessary for programming microcontrollers. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Keil, MPLAB X, or Arduino IDE provide a platform for writing, compiling, and debugging code. Students learn to write programs in languages such as C or C++ that interact directly with the microcontroller's registers and peripherals. They also get acquainted with debugging techniques to identify and rectify errors in the code.  The laboratory exercises are designed to introduce students to the core concepts of embedded systems programming gradually. Initially, simple projects such as blinking an LED or reading input from a button help build a foundation in programming syntax, variable declaration, and basic control structures. As students progress, they tackle more complex tasks like interfacing with sensors to collect data, communicating between devices using protocols like UART, and implementing real-time operating systems for multitasking applications.  Hands-on projects play a crucial role in reinforcing theoretical knowledge and enhancing problem-solving skills. Students may work on designing systems like temperature-controlled fans, automated plant watering systems, or even small robotics projects. These projects not only demonstrate the practical application of embedded systems but also encourage creativity and innovation in finding solutions to real-world problems.  Collaboration and teamwork are often emphasized in embedded microcontroller programming laboratories. Students may engage in group projects where they divide tasks, communicate effectively, and integrate individual components into a cohesive system. This simulates the collaborative environment of industry settings where engineers often work together on complex embedded system designs.  Apart from technical skills, the lab also focuses on teaching good coding practices and documentation standards. Students learn to write modular and well-commented code that is easy to understand and maintain. They also document their projects thoroughly, outlining the system architecture, hardware connections, software algorithms, and testing procedures. This fosters professionalism and prepares students for working in environments that require clear communication and organized development processes.  As students advance through the lab curriculum, they explore advanced topics such as power optimization, memory management, interrupt handling, and security considerations in embedded systems. They delve into optimization techniques to reduce power consumption, utilize memory efficiently, handle system interrupts for real-time responsiveness, and implement security measures to protect embedded systems from external threats.  Moreover, the laboratory provides a platform for students to experiment with emerging technologies in the field of embedded systems. They may work with wireless communication protocols like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, integrate cloud services for data storage and analysis, or explore edge computing concepts for processing data locally on embedded devices. These experiences expose students to cutting-edge developments and trends in the industry, equipping them with relevant skills for the workforce.  In conclusion, embedded microcontroller programming laboratories are indispensable components of engineering education, offering students a holistic learning experience in designing and programming embedded systems.

"3080","""Modernism as a movement came about as a reaction to the 'inescapable forces of turbulent social modernization.' The race for empire, World War I, the Suffrage movement, and conflict in Ireland, as well as popular concerns over novel ways of thinking: nihilism, relativism, fakery- all gave rise to a desire for radical breaks with tradition in favour of new beginnings; a desire that 'penetrated the interior of artistic invention.' It is a movement characterized by an 'emphasis on verbal texture,' and by 'clusters of images, metaphors and symbols.' One of the ways the aesthetics of Modernism were displayed was through the 'disintegration of coherent narratives and settings into startling and apparently unrelated images.' The critic R. Emig states that 'poetry.is a paradigm, a model of the pattern, of Modernism;' therefore in order to explore the Modernist's 'attention to 'form' as opposed to 'content'' and illustrate the move away from a traditional narrative form I will discuss the work of the Imagist Poets. Similarly, James Joyce 'radically departed from the formula-oriented modes and devices of the plotted story' in his collection of short stories, entitled Dubliners, another text I will examine. M. Ibid, Pg E. San Juan, Jr; James Joyce and the Craft of Fiction; (New York, Associated University Press, 972) pg 6/5/8 R. Emig; Modernism in Poetry: Motivations, Structures, & Limits; (New York, Longman Group Ltd, 995/8) Pg R. Emig; Modernism in Poetry: Motivations, Structures, & Limits; (New York, Longman Group Ltd, 995/8) Pg M. It is worth comparing some works of the Imagist Poets to those in the Lyrical Ballads by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in order to see clearly the rejection of 'both explicit and identifiable speakers and narratives' in the latter. Both F. S. Flint's 'Beggar' and Wordsworth's 'The Female Vagrant' deal with the issue of poverty; however, Wordsworth goes to great lengths describing to the reader the 'artless story' of the vagrant. The poem begins with the beginning of her tale: R. Emig; Modernism in Poetry: Motivations, Structures, & Limits; (New York, Longman Group Ltd, 995/8) Pg 08 ''by Derwent's side my father's cottage stood', The woman thus her artless story told.'D., An Anthology; rd 5/86 The reader is presented with the story as a narrative, encompassing the entirety of the vagrant's experience of poverty. The vagrant is speaking directly to the narrator, giving a heightened sense of reality to her tale. In contrast, Flint's poem presents the Beggar 'in the gutter' as he would be seen by a passer-by. The opinions of the beggar himself are of no interest to the poet; instead he is focused on the image of the beggar in itself. Therefore, although their subject matter is similar, the aims of the two poets are different. Whilst Wordsworth's verses can be read as a social commentary, intended to inspire pity in the reader, Flint is striving to present what Ezra Pound called the 'intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time.' Pound stated that an Imagist poet 'seeks out the luminous detail. He does not comment.' Thus we, as readers, are given no background and are instead presented with a myriad of impressions: 'huddled and mean,' 'winds beat him,' 'wind from an empty belly.' Peter 6 R. Emig; Modernism in Poetry: Motivations, Structures, & Limits; (New York, Longman Group Ltd, 995/8) Pg 08 Ezra Pound, cited in Lecture handout, 7.2.6 This layering of images characterises the poetry of the Modernists which is typically 'made of details' but devoid of a narrative. Flint's poem showcases the 'depersonalizing the poetic voice;' what we are given instead is a picture made almost photographic by an overabundance of details and adjectives: 'shrivelled,' 'draggled,' 'forlorn.' By presenting an image in such a manner Flint is demonstrating one of the three 'rules' of the Imagist school: 'direct treatment of the 'thing,' whether subjective or objective.' The lack of a narrative serves to negate what impact the opinions of a conventional narrator may otherwise have had, and thus allows the reader to be much more sensitized to the mood, rather than the moral message, of the piece. Peter 6 Ibid, Pg 6, Pg 29 The story 'Counterparts,' in Joyce's Dubliners, is similarly lacking in a moral message. In it, Joyce 'tacitly acknowledges the undercurrents of anger, frustration & helplessness that pervade Irish life.' The story clearly showcases the dangers of a life stifled by oppression: Farrington is trapped in a job he dislikes and is treated badly by his boss. He does not act on the 'spasm of rage' that he feels towards Mr Alleyne; instead he cruelly beats his young son on returning home. The cries of the 'little boy' inspire great pathos: Suzette A. Henke; James Joyce & the Politics of Desire; (U. K, Routledge, 990) pg James Joyce; Dubliners; (U.S.A, The Viking Press, 991) pg 8 ''O, pa!' he cried. 'Don't beat me, pa! And I'll. I'll say a Hail Mary for you. I'll say a Hail Mary for you, pa, if you don't beat me.''Ibid, pg 09 However, like Flint in The Beggar, Joyce is not condemning Farrington's actions. Joyce praised Ibsen for presenting 'average lives in their uncompromising truth,' and in this story he is doing just that. Joyce 'held up a mirror to the average Irishman' in what he termed his 'nicely polished looking glass.' In this story and throughout Dubliners Joyce is highlighting the effects of 'moral paralysis or hemiplegia of the will,' something he put down to 'the experience of modern urban life.' Like the Imagist poets, Joyce moved away from a traditional narrative form to convey this message, instead recognising 'the complexity of language as the fundamental medium of culture in its historical, creative and unconscious dimensions.' James Joyce, cited in: M. 5/8 D.T Torchiana, Joyce's Dubliners; (London, Allen & Unwin Ltd, 986) pg James Joyce, cited, ibid. James Joyce, Cited in lecture handout, 0.2.6 M. 7 Joyce's focus on language is skilfully paired with 'a detailed, closely observed depiction of the surfaces of life.' As such he adopts a 'naturalistic' approach. Humans are imprisoned in the social and physical; therefore Joyce places less emphasis on a heavily plotted narrative, and the intensity of his stories comes instead from his ability to precisely capture a mood. In 'Eveline' the entirety of the story is presented as a stream of consciousness. Up to the last section there is an air of pensive musing to the tale, as Eveline sits at the window weighing up her decision: Lecture handout, 0.2.6 'She had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise?'James Joyce; Dubliners; (U.S.A, The Viking Press, 991) pg 8 This meditative air is paired with many small details, which add a sense of reality to the story and make it more vivid: 'Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.'Ibid, pg 7 By using language in this manner Joyce is able to capture a precise mood, and although we are given little detail about the life of Eveline herself, by adjusting the style of the story to the experience of the main protagonist, Joyce is able to bring her character alive. Eveline is vague about Buenos Aires, where she is proposing to spend the rest of her life. As readers we can assume that this is due to the fact that she has never previously left Dublin. It is perhaps for this reason that although Eveline feels that 'she must escape' and that 'Frank would save her,' when it comes to it she finds herself in 'a maze of distress:' Ibid, pg 1, pg 2 'No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish!'Ibid. We can emphasise completely with Eveline's distress in this story. Despite there being little by way of an 'exciting suspenseful narrative,' the development of her character shows a very human complexity to her wants and desires, a paradoxical nature to her feelings which the readers can easily relate to. Lecture handout, 0.2.6 Joyce uses a similar technique to develop a character in 'The Sisters,' the first story in the collection. It is written from the point of view of a young boy, and Joyce is careful, therefore, to keep the language and opinions of the piece consistent with his protagonist. For that reason he changed the following passage which was originally written in a comparatively adult cadence: 'The ceremonious candles in the light of which the Christian must take his last sleep.'James Joyce, cited in R. Ellman; James Joyce; (London, Oxford University Press, 966) pg 0 The sentence was replaced with the much more straightforward and child-like: 'The reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse.'James Joyce; Dubliners; (U.S.A, The Viking Press, 991) pg This retains the meaning of the original, yet by simplifying the language and extending the sentence length, Joyce ensures that it is much more in keeping with a younger narrator. Very little action takes place in this story; it is instead the complexity and authenticity of the characterization that maintains the reader's interest. Joyce immediately sets the tone of the piece with the opening lines. The story opens with a negative: 'There was no hope for him this time,' and throughout the first paragraph the gloomy atmosphere is intensified by his use of language: 'dead,' 'corpse,' 'paralysis.' Much of the story takes place at night or at twilight, and throughout is permeated with the powerful image of the 'old priest.lying still in his coffin.' The tale ends abruptly, with a startling image: that of the priest in his confession box, 'wide-awake and laughing-like to himself.' The unexpected nature of this image could be explained by the Modernist 'resolve to startle and disturb the public.' In any case, it ensures that the figure of the priest is a vivid one, showing that ' most powerful characters are often those who are barely seen.' By creating such a powerful image Joyce is able to ensure, with out the use of a lengthy narrative, that a character who does not speak once throughout the piece is one who will leave a lasting impression on the reader. Ibid Ibid pg 7 Ibid T. S. Eliot, cited in M. D. T. Torchiana; Joyce's Dubliners; (London, Allen & Unwin Ltd, 986) pg 3 This stress on what was termed the 'doctrine of the image' can also be seen in Richard Aldington's poem, Images. In it, the theme of love is explored in six stanzas, each presenting the reader with striking imagery, made more compelling by the use of both simile and metaphor: 'The blue smoke leaps/ Like swirling clouds of birds vanishing.' 'A rose yellow moon in a pale sky.' The style is succinct and direct; language, such as this, 'checked by the application of sculptural analysis,' has the effect of creating a poetic method that is fragmented and yet unified in its presentation of Aldington's 'desires.' By using strong imagery in this fashion, Aldington creates a poem that is full of what may be termed 'static beauty.' However despite the clarity and precision of the image, Aldington's poem displays little real emotion or psychology. The character of his love is not revealed to us, nor is the progress of the relationship. This shows the Imagist school's break away from conventional lyric poetry which evolved out of the ballad form, and therefore maintained strong narrative traditions. By 'cutting, arresting, limiting, permitting no flow' in the language used, the Imagists were able to concentrate on capturing a precise mood in their poetry. Ezra Pound, cited in Hugh Kenner; The Pound Era; (London, Faber & Faber, 972) pg 78 Peter 4 Hugh Kenner; The Pound Era; (London, Faber & Faber, 972) pg 75/8 Peter 5/8 Hugh Kenner; The Pound Era; (London, Faber & Faber, 972) pg 75/8 A similar focus on mood is seen in John Gould Fletcher's The Skaters. The entire poem is an extended metaphor based on a single image- that of ice-skaters as they 'skim over the frozen river.' Fletcher compares the skaters to 'black swallows,' and at the end of the poem describes the sound of their skating to 'the brushing together of thin wing-tips of silver.' By beginning and ending with images of flight, Fletcher is surrounding the central image, that of the skaters, with the metaphor. By doing so, the poet is lending these brief lines a sense of neatness and completeness. It is this aspect of Imagist poetry that is described by M. Levenson when he states that 'every element of the work is an instrument of its effect.' The brevity of the verse results in a necessary precision in the language; there is no room for superfluous details in this poem. If one is to maintain this sense of crispness to the text, 'language is no longer freely available for mere ornamental descriptions of reality,' and lengthy narrative styles become obsolete. Peter 0 Ibid M. R. Emig; Modernism in Poetry: Motivations, Structures, & Limits; (New York, Longman Group Ltd, 995/8) Pg 6 The poet H.D., one of the founders of the Imagist school along with Ezra Pound and Richard Aldington, was particularly noted for her sharp, direct style of poetry. She strove to think exclusively through images, and in her verses she presented 'no detail not germane to such thinking, no detail obligated merely by pictorial completeness.' In this sense, her poem entitled 'Evening' is redolent of T. S. Eliot's 'heap of broken images.' In H. D.'s description of a garden at sunset there is a distinct feel of fragmentation and obtuseness about the verses, which at times seems almost wilfully obscure: Hugh Kenner; The Pound Era; (London, Faber & Faber, 972) pg 76 T. S. Eliot; Selected Poems; (London, Faber & Faber, 002) pg 1 'shadow seeks shadow, then both leaf and leaf-shadow are lost.'Peter 3 The poem is written in vers libre: there is no ostensibly fixed rhyme scheme or rhythm. Therefore the line breaks, not determined by form, take on 'an integrity and function of own.' H.D. does not capitalize the beginning of each line, and makes little use of punctuation throughout the poem. Eliot called this rejection of any formulaic poetic structure the 'unperceived evasion of monotony.' Changes in religious and scientific thinking, which had resulted from the works of Darwin in the nineteenth century, had placed a new emphasis on man as an individual rather than as part of the prevalent religious and social ideals of his time. 'Within an intellectual framework based on human autonomy, originality becomes the benchmark of human quality;' H. D is not conforming to what Modernists saw as the empty musicality of Victorian literature, the 'horrible agglomerate compost.a doughy mess of third-hand Keats, Wordsworth.fourth-hand Elizabethan sonority.' She is instead asserting her 'claim to aesthetic dignity' by rejecting a style which 'had sold itself to a mass reading public.' In common with the poems previously discussed, these are verses 'liberated from metaphysical and religious master-plans,' and as such are free to create and capture a mood rather than to tell a story. Derek Attridge; Poetic Rhythm: An T. S. Eliot, 'Reflections on Vers Libre', cited in lecture handout, 8.2.5/8 R. Emig; Modernism in Poetry: Motivations, Structures, & Limits; (New York, Longman Group Ltd, 995/8) Pg Ezra in lecture handout, 7.2.6 L. Rainey; Institutions of Modernism: Literary Elites & Public Culture; (U.S.A, Yale University Press, 998) pg R. Emig; Modernism in Poetry: Motivations, Structures, & Limits; (New York, Longman Group Ltd, 995/8) Pg It is clear, then, that the Imagist poets desired a complete break with tradition and, in doing so, strove to focus on capturing an exact image rather than telling interesting stories. They, like many involved with the Modernist movement, were 'reaffirming and fortifying the boundaries between art and mass culture;' a mass culture they 'construed as a threat of encroaching formlessness.' As a Modernist writer, James Joyce was concerned with similar aesthetic ideals: those of focus not on content but on method, of brevity and accuracy in prose, of 'directness, verbal economy, and musicality.' However, unlike the Imagist poems, Joyce's Dubliners does contain elements of an 'underlying theme or argument' that unfolds like a thread throughout the stories. It is for this reason that the critic Hugh Kenner argues that Dubliners is 'less a sequence of stories than a kind of multi-faceted novel.' It is the theme of paralysis, introduced in the first of the stories and returned to in each, that serves as a 'unifying concern' throughout Dubliners. The main protagonists in each tale are 'trapped in limited domestic situations;' again and again escape is offered, only to be turned down. This can be seen, for example, in 'A Painful Case,' in which Mr James Duffey is offered the chance of companionship to relieve his futile and lonely existence. It is not until he hears of Mrs Sinico's death that he becomes fully aware of the misplaced 'rectitude of his life.' L Rainey; Institutions of Modernism: Literary Elites and Public Culture; (U.S.A, Yale University Press, 998) pg Lecture handout, 0.2.6 E. San Juan, Jr; James Joyce and the Craft of Fiction; (New York, Associated University Press, 972) pg 7 H. Kenner; Dublin's Joyce; (U.S.A, Chatto & Windus, 969) pg 8 E. San Juan, Jr; James Joyce and the Craft of Fiction; (New York, Associated University Press, 972) pg 7 Suzette A. Henke; James Joyce & the Politics of Desire; (U. K, Routledge, 990) pg James Joyce; Dubliners; (U.S.A, The Viking Press, 991) pg 30 'He gnawed at the rectitude of his life; he felt that he had been outcast from life's feast.'Ibid Joyce repeats the latter phrase, stressing how Duffey has 'withheld life;' in Dubliners it was 'Joyce's intention to expose the spiritual decay of his countrymen and to caricature their afflicted souls.' Therefore the motif of entrapment and paralysis is central to each story. Ibid E. San Juan, Jr; James Joyce and the Craft of Fiction; (New York, Associated University Press, 972) pg 8 The changes to contemporary aesthetic ideals at the beginning of the nineteenth century can be interpreted as a 'late endeavour to come to terms with the rifts that were thrown open by modernity.' Great social, economic and political turmoil caused writers to loose faith in the artistic conventions of the immediate past, and to look instead to the Greco-Roman period for inspiration. They 'disavowed their Romantic inheritance in order to assert their roots in an earlier tradition trumpeted as 'classicism.'' This 'Modernist contempt for popular culture' created a literary upheaval; one that dramatically changed the shape of the narrative form. The Imagist poets abandoned the idea of telling interesting stories in their poetry, instead adopting what Ezra Pound called 'laconic speech.' It is this speech: 'objective - no slither - direct.straight as the Greek' - which allows the poets to capture so skilfully an exact mood or to present so faithful an image. In Dubliners Joyce adopts a similar 'generalization of unexpected exactness.' His 'almost obsessive demand for accuracy,' and insistence that 'only the accurate fact ensured the meaning,' resulted in a style that moved away from traditional narratives packed with action and event, and towards presenting 'a single individual in the infinite labyrinth of his little life.' By not presenting the reader with a narrative, Joyce does not take his characters through several stages of development. He is free instead to concentrate on developing and capturing the complexity of the characters that we find in every story, presented as they are in a moment in time. R.

This literary movement marked a departure from traditional forms and conventions, ushering in a new era of experimentation, innovation, and introspection. Modernist writers sought to capture the complexities of the modern world, grappling with issues of identity, time, perception, and the human experience in ways that challenged established norms and values.  A key characteristic of modernist literature is its commitment to depicting the fragmented, chaotic nature of reality. Writers like James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and T.S. Eliot employed innovative narrative techniques such as stream of consciousness, nonlinear storytelling, and collage-like structures to convey the uncertainty and disorientation of the modern world. In Joyce's """"Ulysses,"""" for example, the reader is thrust into the minds of the characters, experiencing their thoughts, memories, and sensory impressions in a fractured and nonlinear manner that mirrors the complexities of human consciousness.  Modernist literature also grappled with the fractured sense of self in the aftermath of World War I, which shattered traditional beliefs in progress, reason, and the stability of the world. Writers like Franz Kafka and Samuel Beckett explored themes of alienation, absurdity, and existential despair in works like """"The Trial"""" and """"Waiting for Godot."""" These writers challenged the notion of a coherent, knowable self, instead presenting characters who are adrift in a world that is indifferent, incomprehensible, and devoid of meaning.  Another hallmark of modernist literature is its engagement with the limitations of language and communication. Writers like Gertrude Stein and e.e. cummings experimented with language, syntax, and form to disrupt conventional modes of expression and meaning. Stein's playful wordplay and repetition in works like """"Tender Buttons"""" and cummings' unconventional use of punctuation and spacing in poems like """"l(a"""" highlight the inadequacy of language to fully capture the complexities of human experience.  Moreover, modernist literature reflected the changing role of women in society and challenged conventional gender roles and expectations. Writers like Woolf and Dorothy Richardson sought to represent the inner lives and experiences of women in ways that had been marginalized or overlooked in earlier literary traditions. Woolf's """"Mrs. Dalloway"""" and Richardson's """"Pilgrimage"""" series offer nuanced portrayals of female subjectivity, highlighting the struggles and desires of women navigating a rapidly changing world.  In addition to its formal and thematic innovations, modernist literature was deeply influenced by developments in psychology, philosophy, and the visual arts. Writers like D.H. Lawrence and Marcel Proust drew on ideas from Freudian psychoanalysis and Bergsonian philosophy to explore the unconscious mind, memory, and the subjective nature of experience. The influence of movements like Cubism and Expressionism can be seen in the fragmented perspectives, multiple viewpoints, and subjective realism that characterize much modernist writing.  Despite its diversity and complexity, modernist literature is united by a common impulse to explore the shifting terrain of the human condition in the 20th century. By challenging traditional literary conventions, embracing new forms of expression, and engaging with the uncertainties and contradictions of modern life, modernist writers left an indelible mark on the literary landscape. Their legacy continues to inspire and provoke contemporary writers to grapple with the enduring questions of existence, identity, and meaning in an ever-changing world.""","693"

With time, the precipitation of crystals became so heavy that the solution glimmered as it was stirred. The resulting solution was filtered using a sintered glass crucible, washed with water and air dried. The black crystals where fine and granular in consistency, until they where dissolved in 5/8oC. The solution was decantered, and cooled in ice with 0-0o petroleum ether for one hour. During cooling, fine black needle-like crystals formed out of solution.

Also, a more acidic pH is required to fully reduce MnO -. Lastly, the ligand association with. Combining all equations gives. Infrared SpectraThe complex can be though of as a derivative of the vanadyl structure is found. The shape of the pentandionato ligands causes a slight deviation from the perfect square base to more rectangular. Association of a ligating species the vandyl oxygen causes a reduction of the V-O bond order and thus the (VO) is made less energetic, ie., the result of adduction of pyridine is to shift the (VO) to a lower wavenumber. This is supported by the work of Selbin, 965/8, in which works he states that in many solvents with un-appreciable coordination ability the wavenumber of vibration is 006 lowered close to 72cm -.. Magnetic DataThe number of unpaired electrons can be found by manipulation of the magnetic moment, of the complexes. The number of unpaired electrons present in the manganese complex suggests the octahedral splitting parameter is low enough as to allow unpairing of all electrons. The octahedral shape is distorted with the result being the compression of some bonds and extension of others, this would alter the splitting pattern but only the pure octahedral splitting is shown below. Lever, 984, explains that distortion along the z-axis will cause splitting of the e degeneracy. However, this principle was not specifically applied to the complex vanadyl bis-acetylacetonate and so the undistorted model will be used. A.B.P. Lever, Inorganic electronic spectroscopy, Elsevier, Suffolk, 984.. Ultraviolet-Visible SpectraSpectra was obtained at 5/80-5/80nm. In all UV-Visible spectra obtained, there is a distinct trough centred at 00nm. This is quite probably due to the wavelength cut-off set for the bulb switch over from the visible bulb to the mercury UV bulb. The actual spectrum is more likely to be continuous from 5/80 up to 5/80nm. To establish this, a different spectrometer would have to be used, or it known for definite if it is viable to adjust the bulb cut-off wavelength using this spectrometer and the samples run again. However, upon closer inspection, the spectrum for Vanadyl bis-acetylacetonate appears to have two troughs at 00nm - one is for sure to be caused by the bulb switch-over, but the other could perhaps be the Band III peak! In addition, the spectra obtained for the vanadyl complex in pyridine, and the manganese complex in both toluene and pyridine exhibit major fluctuations to the expected smooth spectrum at wavelength under 75/8nm. This can perhaps be rationalised by considering the absorbance below this wavelength goes above the working range of spectrometer of between and. Above A=., the sensitivity becomes very low for the machine ie., in the case of vanadyl in pyridine, the absorbance approaches which given the logarithmic ratio nature of the measurement means the machine is trying to make measurements in the one part transmission per million, with C V symmetry the degeneracy of the e is removed, and thus four d orbital transition are possible although not all are allowed following formal symmetry rules. The bands between 00nm and 00nm are these d-d transition. This is what gives rise to the colour of the complex. The strong adsorption characteristic of the vanadyl centre gives rise to it's typical blue-green colour. All higher bands are charge transfer. The effect of an associating solvent is shift the band II peak higher in wavenumber, and band I to a lower wavenumber, as is quoted by Selbin, 965/8. Calculation of the extinction coefficientsThe Lambert-Beer law can be manipulated to give the molar extinction coefficient in terms of absorbance, cell length and molar concentration. The exact mass of the samples dissolved which where used in the spectroscopy is unknown. It would appear therefore impossible to calculate molar extinction coefficients. However, the assumption made that the solutions were saturated is true for solutions in toluene, for which the solubilities where low and so the concentration is known ie., saturation solubility. With solubility data available from literary sources it should be possible to calculate, or at least estimate the molar extinction coefficients. However, I was unable to find literary values for the solubility of complexes in toluene. In pyridine, the complexes where very soluble and I was not able to saturate the solutions.. ESR Spectra of of the gyromagnetic factor, gH is taken to be..75/8cm read from the graph corresponds to 8.8gauss or.7mT. This is a fairly large hyperfine splitting constant and implies the paramagnetic electron is delocalised away from the metal centre. Physical means of g and AParamagnetic materials possess an unpaired electron which spin can be forced to undergo a transition through the application of radiation. The energy required to bring about this spin transition depends on the strength of the magnetic environment in which the paramagnetic electron is found. The magnetic field is applied externally and thus it's strength is known - however, the frequency of radiation required to bring about resonance is different to what would be expected, which implies the electron experiences additional magnetic influences. These other magnetic effects are caused by the local magnetic environment in which the electron is found, ie., through spin-orbit coupling. When an electron is placed in a magnetic field it's degeneracy is split dependant upon the B-fields magnitude. The energy separation between levels is proportional to the effective magnetic field strength and the gyromagnetic factor. The gyromagnetic factor is characteristic of the complex under measurement. For a free electron, the g-factor is.023 (g e), and when the observed g-factor is greater than g e, the local field is larger than that applied externally. The magnetic field set for which the data was collected requires radiation with frequency of.2GHz. This is in the X-Band range, and has a wavelength of ca..5/8cm. Nuclei that possess non-zero spin contribute additional magnetic components to the field. This gives rise to a hyperfine, I+ splitting pattern. The magnitude of the hyperfine splitting constant tells us how probable it is that the paramagnetic electron is found close to a magnetic nucleus. This is has a very important implication - if the ligands possess magnetic nuclei, then the constant tells us to what extent the metal's paramagnetic electron is delocalised onto the ligands.""","""Metal Acetylacetonate Complexes Analysis""","1942","""Metal acetylacetonate complexes are an intriguing class of compounds that have gained significant attention in the field of inorganic chemistry due to their diverse properties and potential applications. These complexes consist of a metal atom coordinated to multiple acetylacetonate ligands, forming stable and versatile structures. Analyzing metal acetylacetonate complexes involves a range of techniques and methods aimed at determining their composition, structure, and properties. By delving into the complexities of these complexes, researchers can uncover valuable insights that contribute to various scientific fields, such as catalysis, materials science, and medicinal chemistry.  One of the fundamental aspects of analyzing metal acetylacetonate complexes is determining their composition. This involves identifying the type of metal ion present in the complex and the number of acetylacetonate ligands coordinated to it. Techniques such as elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are commonly employed to ascertain the stoichiometry of the complex. Elemental analysis provides information about the elemental composition of the complex, while mass spectrometry can aid in determining the molecular weight of the complex. NMR spectroscopy, particularly proton and carbon NMR, offers insights into the chemical environment of the metal ion and the ligands, aiding in structural elucidation.  Structural elucidation plays a crucial role in the analysis of metal acetylacetonate complexes, as it provides detailed information about the arrangement of atoms within the complex. X-ray crystallography is a powerful technique used to determine the three-dimensional structure of metal complexes at the atomic level. By crystallizing the complex and subjecting it to X-ray diffraction analysis, researchers can visualize the spatial arrangement of the metal ion and ligands, including bond lengths, bond angles, and coordination geometry. This structural information is vital for understanding the reactivity, stability, and properties of the complex.  In addition to determining composition and structure, analyzing the properties of metal acetylacetonate complexes is essential for elucidating their behavior and potential applications. One key property of these complexes is their thermal stability, which can be investigated using techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA provides information about the decomposition profile of the complex upon heating, while DSC can reveal the phase transitions and associated energy changes. Understanding the thermal behavior of metal acetylacetonate complexes is crucial for their handling and utilization in various processes.  Another important property of metal acetylacetonate complexes is their magnetic behavior, which stems from the presence of unpaired electrons in the metal ion. Magnetic susceptibility measurements can be employed to determine the magnetic moment of the complex, which reflects the presence of magnetic interactions within the system. Paramagnetic complexes exhibit a magnetic moment indicative of the presence of unpaired electrons, while diamagnetic complexes show no magnetic moment due to paired electrons. Studying the magnetic properties of metal acetylacetonate complexes provides insights into their electronic structure and potential magnetic applications.  Analyzing the reactivity of metal acetylacetonate complexes is also crucial for understanding their chemical behavior and potential applications in catalysis and materials science. Reactivity studies can involve investigating the coordination chemistry of the complex, including ligand exchange reactions and redox processes. Techniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry can be utilized to monitor the electronic transitions and redox behavior of the complex, respectively. By probing the reactivity of metal acetylacetonate complexes, researchers can uncover valuable information about their transformation pathways and chemical properties.  Furthermore, exploring the spectroscopic properties of metal acetylacetonate complexes offers valuable insights into their electronic structure and bonding. UV-Vis spectroscopy is a powerful technique used to study the absorption of light by the complex, providing information about electronic transitions within the molecule. The presence of characteristic absorption bands in the UV-Vis spectrum can reveal details about the coordination environment of the metal ion and the ligand field strength. Additionally, infrared (IR) spectroscopy can be employed to study the vibrational modes of the complex, offering information about the bonding interactions between the metal ion and ligands.  In the realm of medicinal chemistry, metal acetylacetonate complexes have attracted interest for their potential therapeutic applications, particularly in the development of metal-based drugs. These complexes exhibit diverse biological activities, including anticancer, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Analyzing the biological properties of metal acetylacetonate complexes involves studying their cytotoxicity, interactions with biomolecules, and mechanisms of action. Techniques such as cell viability assays, protein binding studies, and mechanistic investigations can shed light on the pharmacological potential of these complexes and their underlying modes of action.  In conclusion, the analysis of metal acetylacetonate complexes is a multifaceted process that encompasses various techniques and methods to unravel their composition, structure, properties, and reactivity. By employing a combination of analytical, spectroscopic, and theoretical approaches, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of these versatile compounds and harness their unique characteristics for a wide range of applications.

"109","""The ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to the specific heat at constant volume was measured using a variation on the Ruchardt defined as the amount of heat required in order to change a unit mass, or a unit the consequent temperature can be found by: any gas there is effectively an infinite number of specific heats, depending on what external variables are held constant, however two notable ones are the value at constant that at constant value is an important thermodynamic quantity that gives an insight into the structure of the gas molecules for which it was calculated. For instance appears in the pressure-volume relation of an adiabatic process, and also in formulas that describe the efficiency of cyclic processes i.e. an internal combustion engine. In principle may be obtained by independently measuring C p and C v, however in practice this method is very time consuming. Instead the value for a gas can be determined from a study of any adiabatic process in which the gas is involved. The earliest recorded method used to calculate is that of Clement- on average an associated kinetic energy per: k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. For a monatomic gas at constant volume all added heat energy goes into an increase in random translational molecular kinetic energy. Monatomic gases therefore have three degrees of a system experiences a temperature increase, but remains at a constant volume, the system does no work on its surroundings. The change in internal the system is equal to the heat equal to the heat the work shows that the heat input for a constant pressure process must therefore be greater than that for a constant volume process, in order to get the same change in internal energy. This is because additional energy must be supplied to account for the work the expansion. It is for this reason that the value for C v and C p are different, the relationship between these two the glass tube. The force involved in the pistons oscillation has two components, a hydrodynamic component resulting from displacement of gas by the moving we consider only small pressure and volume changes then we can assume this adiabatic process is reversible and therefore obeys the Poisson equation: p is the pressure and V is the volume of the gas. Differentiating this equation shows that for a quasi-static adiabatic change: force F acting on the piston due to the change in pressure P can be written: force is quasi-elastic, in the form F=-kz with a spring constant: we assume that the frictional damping is negligible then the resonant frequency f of the system is given by: the situation where both bungs are in place we use the substitution, and likewise if both bungs are removed then. Finally if only one bung is present. The following solutions for gamma can then be derived: (3). Experimental DetailsThe metal piston was placed equidistant from either end of the glass tube, between the encircling magnetic coils. An A.C. current was driven through the coil forcing the piston to oscillate. A frequency generator, which controlled the A.C. current through the magnetic coil, was used to alter the oscillation frequency of the piston. At the natural frequency of the system clear amplitude resonance is observed, this frequency value is recorded. The metal piston was fitted snugly into the tube, in order to prevent leakage of gas from one side of the cylinder to the other, and was aligned correctly so that it oscillated freely in the tube with no resistance to motion. A sliding sleeve placed around the tube was used to mark the amplitude of oscillation at different frequencies. The resonant frequency for air was determined with two bungs in found for these two gases. It is noted that the response time between adjusting the frequency generator value, and observing the requested change in oscillation of the piston was of the order of a couple of seconds. The delay was significant enough to hinder the determination of the resonant frequency air. This was because the response was sporadic, and the frequency produced by the generator appeared to oscillate of its own accord. The gas filling system involved pumping the gas into each end of the tube separately, using the gas flow to push the piston to the extremities of the respective end of the tube, thus replacing the air in the tube with the chosen gas. This process was repeated for each end alternately, opening the bung on the end of the tube sufficiently to allow the air to exit. It is noted that the use of this system means it is unlikely that the tube is filled completely with the chosen gas. The length of each gas column was measure using a ruler. The cross-sectional the tube was assumed to be that of the piston, this assumption is valid if the piston has a snug fit, and was therefore derived using the diameter of the piston, which is measured using vernier calipers. The half volume of the then calculated using the cross-sectional area, and the length of the taken using scales and the temperature and the lab are noted regularly during the day.. ResultsThree runs were taken for each frequency value, and the average was then calculated. The values for f and f were only taken for air, since measurements without a bung in place were impossible to take with this equipment for any other gas. The value for Air, Nitrogen and Argon, was calculated using with a homemade temperature sensor were used to record the time evolution of temperature, pressure and volume, oscillating around an equilibrium value. The value is then calculated using the slope of a graph plotting the measured relative changes in pressure against the measured relative changes in volume, and substituting this into equation . It is likely that this alternative method would find experimental results that closer to the predicted values than found in this experiment.. ConclusionThe ratio of specific heat was measured for Air, Nitrogen and Argon using the Ruchardt apparatus. The experimental value of found for Air, when calculated using values based on the tube having both or one of the bungs in place, agreed with the value predicted from theory and a referenced accepted value. However this was only after having re-assessed the significance of errors in the experiment. The value for obtained for Nitrogen and Argon, as well as the value for Air when based upon the piston oscillating with no bungs in the tube, contained large discrepancies with the values predicted by theory. Analysis of the ratio between the two values found for Air suggests that there is an error in the measurement of f, the resonant frequency of the piston with no bungs in place. It is also noted that the lack of measurement of the pressure inside the tube for Argon and Nitrogen, and the inability to measure f for these gases may have contributed to the error in the result for the ratio of specific heat of these gases. Amendments to the experimental set-up that addressed these errors were discussed..

In gases, specific heat plays a significant role in determining their thermal properties and how they respond to changes in their environment. The measurement of specific heat in gases involves various techniques and principles that help scientists and engineers in studying and utilizing gases effectively in a wide range of applications.  One of the primary methods used to measure specific heat in gases is the method of mixtures. This method involves transferring a known quantity of a hot substance at a known temperature to a known mass of the gas at a lower initial temperature in a calorimeter. The heat lost by the hot substance is equal to the heat gained by the gas, allowing for the calculation of the specific heat capacity of the gas. This method relies on the principle of conservation of energy and is commonly used in laboratories to measure specific heat in gases accurately.  Another common technique for measuring specific heat in gases is the method of constant volume. This method involves measuring the temperature change of a gas held at a constant volume when a known quantity of heat is added to it. By measuring the temperature change and using the known values of heat and mass, the specific heat capacity of the gas can be determined. This method is particularly useful for gases that can be easily contained and heated under constant volume conditions.  The method of constant pressure is another important technique used to measure specific heat in gases. In this method, a gas is heated at a constant pressure while the temperature change is recorded. By knowing the heat added, pressure, and temperature change, the specific heat capacity of the gas can be calculated. This method is commonly used in industrial applications where gases are often heated or cooled under constant pressure conditions.  The specific heat of a gas can also be determined theoretically using the principles of statistical mechanics. By considering the various energy levels of gas molecules and their probabilities, the specific heat capacity of a gas can be calculated based on its molecular structure and interactions. This theoretical approach provides valuable insights into the behavior of gases at the molecular level and can complement experimental measurements of specific heat.  Measuring specific heat in gases is essential for various practical applications. For example, in the field of thermodynamics, specific heat values are crucial for predicting the behavior of gases in heat engines and refrigeration systems. Understanding the specific heat capacity of gases also helps in designing efficient heating and cooling processes in industries such as manufacturing and chemical engineering.  Furthermore, specific heat measurements in gases are vital in environmental studies and climate science. By understanding how gases absorb and release heat, scientists can model and predict changes in Earth's atmosphere and climate. Specific heat values of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, play a critical role in understanding their impact on global warming and climate change.  In conclusion, specific heat measurement in gases is a fundamental aspect of understanding the thermal properties of gases and their behavior when subjected to changes in temperature. By employing various experimental and theoretical techniques, scientists and engineers can accurately determine the specific heat capacity of gases, leading to advancements in fields such as thermodynamics, industrial processes, and environmental science. The study of specific heat in gases continues to play a significant role in advancing our understanding of heat transfer and energy conversion processes in diverse applications.""","676"

Among those factors most frequently mentioned are price, brand and store name as well as country of product origin. The question that the following research attempts to answer is how important the abovementioned external product attributes are to consumers from various socio-economic backgrounds, when they shop at Marks and as an quality of -store display; (Sheth, 999). Important for this study is the fact that East mentions Marks and Spencer as a store credited with strong drawing power. According to this author M&S offers a product range or standard of service that is not easily found in other stores. Another attraction for the customer is store brands. Their exclusive availability may be one more source of customer's this method's response rate as high. Plan B: Mail questionnaireThe computer-based type of survey may repel elderly customers lacking computer skills. Therefore, if the mall-intercept would not provide at least 0% of responses from customers aged 5/8 and over, up to 0 letters with questionnaires would be sent to M&S customers fulfilling these criteria. The in-home survey was excluded as not safe for interviewers. In spite of the relatively high response rate the phone method was excluded as annoying for respondents. Given the project budget, phone computer assisted would limit the number of responses to c.a. 00. E-mail based survey could not generate adequate number of responses and would not allow for the control of the data collection environment. The following table presents survey cost estimation.. Sampling techniqueThe target population is defined as with children aged 0- delimited on the basis of lifestyle and socio-economic criteria such as age, number of family members and income that are included in the first part of the questionnaire. In order to reduce the selection bias tight controls will be imposed on interviewers and interviewing procedure and precise guidelines will be suggested for improving the quality of quota samples.""","""Consumer Purchase Decisions Analysis""","402","""Consumer purchase decisions are complex processes influenced by various factors. Understanding these factors is crucial for businesses seeking to appeal to their target audience effectively. One key aspect of analyzing consumer purchase decisions is looking at the psychological factors that drive choices. Emotions, motivations, perceptions, and attitudes all play a significant role in shaping consumer behavior.  Emotional factors are particularly powerful in influencing purchase decisions. Consumers often make buying choices based on how a product or service makes them feel. This can range from seeking pleasure and happiness to wanting to avoid negative emotions like fear or guilt. Understanding and tapping into these emotions through marketing strategies can sway consumer preferences and drive sales.  Motivations also play a vital role in consumer decision-making. Consumers are driven by various needs such as physiological, safety, social belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. By aligning products or services with these motivations, businesses can appeal to consumers more effectively. For example, marketing a luxury watch as a symbol of status and achievement taps into the esteem need of consumers.  Perceptions and attitudes towards a product or brand significantly impact purchase decisions. Consumers form perceptions based on their experiences, marketing messages, reviews, and word of mouth. Positive perceptions lead to favorable attitudes and likelihood of purchase, while negative perceptions can deter consumers. Marketers must work on shaping positive perceptions through branding, product quality, and customer service.  Moreover, external factors like social influences, cultural norms, reference groups, and economic conditions also sway consumer purchase decisions. Social media, peer recommendations, and societal trends can all influence what consumers choose to buy. Understanding these external influences is essential for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies effectively.  In conclusion, consumer purchase decisions are multi-faceted processes driven by emotional, motivational, perceptual, attitudinal, and external factors. Businesses that invest in understanding these factors and tailor their strategies accordingly are better positioned to attract and retain customers. Analyzing consumer purchase decisions is a continuous process that evolves with changing consumer preferences and market dynamics.""","396"
"3129","""Knowledge can be defined and interpreted in a number of ways, the most common assumes it is, 'the information, understanding and skills that you gain through education or experience: practical / medical / scientific knowledge.' If adopting this definition and relating it to the statement above it is necessary to examine exactly who, during the Renaissance era, would have been accustomed to this kind of Knowledge. Whether it was gender specific, dependant on status or wealth and in how it was used to shape English Society. URL The Renaissance era is one best known for its development and exploration of artistic, cultural and intellectual movement, and though with its roots centred firmly in Italy the influence of the renaissance reached many European countries including Britain. This was a result achieved partly due to numbers of scholars travelling from England to Italy with the intention of learning Classical literature and teaching. With the introduction of this 'new knowledge' and European influence, British society began to explore its own culture using the new and different ideas regarding the arts, science and religion. The need to gain and challenge the ideas that create knowledge has always been fundamental to the way in which a society is able to expand; the old cliche that declares knowledge is power is perhaps at the base of most societies. It is through Knowledge that economical, political and geographical gain can be achieved, factors perhaps essential to maintain law and order. The very way in which knowledge itself is valued and perceived reflects the attitudes of those in pursuit of it, it can shape an entire country indicating its possible potential or even lack there of. Perhaps it is safe to assume that Governments or Commonwealths that have failed or struggled in the past have been based on a false or superficial regard for Knowledge. That is, it has been applied to a particular set of topics which are accordingly then exposed to a particular category of people. For example, during the 5/8 th and 6 th Century Knowledge was considered only to be accessible by the upper class, the nobility. Wealth and status determined the type of education which was acceptable for an individual to receive; Latin and Greek, along with Mathematics and Astrology were deemed suitable subjects for most scholars. The perception of Knowledge and the way it can be defined is often restricted and confined to go along with the social norms and expectations. However surely Knowledge can be discovered, acquired and possessed by anyone and anywhere regardless of their background or social status or wealth. Knowledge can defy time by being both simultaneously old and new depending on whom it is directed to, its very boundaries are continuously being challenged and explored. Its fluidity means that it can be manipulated to bring and take advantage in a wide range of situations and the ways in which it can be represented are countless. In both Utopia, by Sir Thomas More and Beware the Cat, by William Baldwin, Knowledge is represented and used to convey each of the texts main message or even to suggest perhaps the lack of one altogether. The latter can be more appropriately applied to Baldwin's text. The representation of Knowledge is conveyed through the various characters which appear in the text, those in positions which assume their hold on Knowledge is secure are often made to look foolish and idiotic, whilst others who the reader would least expect to have any capacity for learning turn out to be the wisest of all. Baldwin enjoys subverting the norm and continuously challenges the conventions of the church. Beware the Cat, the first English novel, is every bit as complex as it is a satirical reflection of the time during which Baldwin was writing. The complexity of the text suggests that the various political and social views that are put across in the text should be taken seriously and would have more than likely provoked a strong reaction from contemporary readers. However the fact that they are placed deliberately side by side the comic, satiric and the the reader to reassess how genuine these view points are being ascertained. The text works on a multiple of levels, the first person narrator who not only tells his own story but five other peoples as well, gives the novel apparent depth which is subsequently dismissed with the absurdity of the events which are involved. Baldwin uses a range of genres and styles; satire, beast fable, dream vision as well as proverb and hymn, all to experiment with the very boundaries of language. During the novel Baldwin toys with the reader, encouraging a certain reading of the text only to shift his approach to another direction, there is a constant sense of underlying movement and sense of unease for the reader not knowing what is expected of them to gain from the text. The only guidelines available to the reader are the comments that Baldwin has added through marginal notes, these enables Baldwin to both maintain his distance as the writer and also to guide the readers response, emphasising significant points in the text. These notes often occur next to some statement or declaration from Master Streamer, the designated narrator. As mentioned earlier Streamer is an example of one of those in a position which would demand a great knowledge and understanding of life based on a sound education and intellect, he is a Divine meaning a lecturer of theology. However Baldwin is very quick to alter this perception or assumption and regularly seeks to undermine and point out the ridiculous nature of the narration. For example before the story even can begin, Streamer dedicates his introduction to the explanation and history behind the names of; Aldersgatae, Moorgate, Ludgate, Aldgate and Cripplegate. This is a wholly uncalled for, irrelevant digression that serves the reader with nothing but the impression that Streamer's character cannot be taken seriously, which is precisely what Baldwin intended. Baldwin ensures that each time Streamer parades his clear lack of knowledge, the reader is made to more than acknowledge its presence. In the third part of the oration, Streamer declares, '.that all our ancestors have failed in knowledge of natural causes. ' Beware the Cat, W. Baldwin ed. W.A. Ringler and Michael Flachman. (Line 6 part, pg 5/8) He completely disregards the work of those belonging to precious generations and continues to state, '.it is not the man that causeth the sea to ebb and flow.but the neaping and springing of the sea is the cause of the moons waxing and waning. '(Line 7-0 part, pp 5/8)Baldwin also uses Streamers character as an object for humour and satire, again reinforcing his foolish nature and reassuring the reader that he is there for their amusement and of course as the narrator. It is during this narration that Streamer, after finishing his typically extravagant description of the process of his potion making, he goes on to narrate its result, '.for barking of dogs, grunting of hogs, wawling of cats, rumbling of rats.' (Line 2-3 part, pp 2)Throughout this excessive collection of rhyming couplets Baldwin merely adds a short and concise marginal note, 'Here the poetic fury came upon him'.(pp32) The contrast between the lengths is quite striking, clearly few words are need for Baldwin to identify the unintentional comical side of Streamers oration. Master Streamer however, is not the only one which Baldwin uses in this way, much of his satire is directed at Religious figures, especially priests which feature regularly throughout the text. By undermining them, it is possible to see that Baldwin represents knowledge by showing those who lack it and making them appear foolish. This is apparent in the case of the Priest who tries to vanquish the devil, who is infact mistaken for Mouse Slayer, the cat, '.his chalice hurt one, and his water pot another, and his holy candle fell into another Priests breech beneath. (line 0, part pg 9)The idea that each of the Priests holy items, intended for good, actually result in causing harm is a significant idea, it perhaps reveals Baldwin's own perception of the incapability and the inept quality of this Religious doctrine, as well as the tradition and convention that belong to it. The Priest himself is found next, in an entirely un-holy and considerably compromising position, '.his face lay upon a boy's bare arse. '(line 1 part, pg 9) Though Baldwin often challenges the conventional representation of Knowledge in this way, he also manages to represent it through the role of the cats. The cats themselves often seem to have some kind of secret knowledge that places them at some advantage, at a superior position to humans. This is mainly shown through the story of Mouse Slayer and the types of humans she encounters, the old woman for instance, who keeps a brothel, is described as, 'very holy and religious.' (line 7, part, pg 0) Mouse Slayer seems to judge each of her owners with a kind of moral knowledge based on the cat law, which unlike human law is obeyed loyally, 'I never disobeyed or transgressed out holy law'(B.T.C line, part, pg 6). Despite even when it is oppressive and degrading towards female cats which forbids them to, 'refuse any males not exceeding the number of ten in one night.' This perhaps suggests that despite Mouse Slayer having knowledge to judge, it does not earn her any equality amongst the males. The fact that the law is considered holy as well also adds to the idea that these cats have more respect for their Governing body. Not only do they have a Government which appears to enforce their laws, but there is also a distinctive hierarchy among them. Streamer hears the cats use titles such as, 'Lord' and, 'Chief Councillor' as well as, 'Assistant'. Indeed, Baldwin applies many humanistic qualities to the cats and it is apparent that their society is meant to be compared to human society. Beware the Cat is on the whole a clearly satirical novel of English Government, its justice system, and also of the Church, representing the knowledge which lies behind these institutions. In this way there is a considerable difference between Beware the Cat and Thomas More's, Utopia. More's main motivation and message lacks the humour and mocking tone that Baldwin adopts, instead opting for a far more grounded and critical evaluation of British society and culture. It is an exposure of the corrupt condition of the English state. However both texts share the same association of Knowledge through the language of Latin. Associating Knowledge with Latin was very common during the Renaissance, it was the essential language to learn for scholars, or individuals who wished to improve their social status. Streamer uses Latin in his narration to appear knowledgeable but does so incorrectly and out of context, therefore once more looking like the fool. Baldwin is reinforcing that knowledge is often misused by those who don't understand it. More originally wrote Utopia entirely in Latin; it wasn't until 85/81 that it was translated into English. This perhaps is why Utopia appears quite a direct and simplistic text with the structure of a compare and contrast technique, using one idealistic fantasy setting against the back drop of reality. In regards to the representation of Knowledge, Utopia is based on it its discovery. More introduces the character, Raphael Hythloday, the imaginary traveller, to take the reader to the imaginary world of Utopia. Hythloday is an explorer and his entire purpose is to travel in the hope of discovering these new worlds and the knowledge they contain. This is perhaps reflective of what was actually happening in Britain during the tine of writing, and what Andrew Hadfield calls, 'early modern English travel and colonial writing.' During the time of publication, Britain was undergoing a period of, 'serious interest in colonial expansion.'(pg 1). Therefore Hadfield draws the conclusion that the Utopians are in fact another version of the English who have to deal with the exact same problems that feature in the reality. A.Hadfield, Literature, Travel and Colonial Writing in the English Renaissance Through Hythloday's discoveries, there is a sense of uncovering a new Knowledge, he tells the fictional More and the reader that this can be used to deepen and extend an individuals knowledge even further. However whereas More believes that this Knowledge should be used to Council and advise those who have the power to change and influence legislation, Hythloday strongly disagrees which in turn provokes a mild argument with neither of the parties accepting the others view when it concludes. Though Hythloday feels it is necessary for him to pass on his discovery of Utopia and the Utopian knowledge and culture, '.would never have left, if it had not been to make that new world known to others.' The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Utopia by Thomas More pg 44 He does not wish to indulge those who would not listen to him. He perceives the Courts as constructed of sycophants and flatterers, '.they appear and even flatter the most absurd statements of favourites through whose influence they seek to stand well with the Prince.'(pp 27)Again, whilst telling More about his meeting with the Cardinal and his advisors, he recalls how they would only approve of his ideas when the Cardinal had voiced his opinion, 'When the Cardinal had concluded, they all began praising enthusiastically ideas which they had received with contempt when I suggested them. ' (pp 35/8) Reinforcing the idea that Knowledge can only gain its credibility once it has been passed from someone with status or influence, its value can only be ascertained once the status of its speaker is known. On the opposite side to Hythloday, More is quite clearly in favour of using knowledge to advise and council. This is perhaps not surprising as More, the author, did in fact become a councillor at the court of Henry VIII, so would naturally have had a more accurate perception of how the courts worked. The More in the text tries to encourage Hythloday, 'Your learning and your knowledge of various countries and people would entertain him, while your advice and your supply of examples would be very helpful in the council chamber.' (pp 27)After more of less agreeing to disagree Hythloday moves on to give a greatly detailed description of Utopia, its history and culture. In Utopia knowledge is regarded rather highly in fact it is considered one of the highest pleasures for the mind, 'In intellectual pursuits they are tireless. '(pp 66) Education is clearly an essential part of their society, they ensure that every child, 'man and woman alike' (pp 60) receive a good introduction to literature and spend their leisure time reading. However though the Society of Utopia appears to be based on equality, there is no class system as such, everyone is treated the same, infact this is almost to the point where there is a danger of losing identity or individuality, it is very clear that there is still a division between those who have practical knowledge and those who have intellectual knowledge. For example if a craftsmen or labourer, '.devotes his leisure so earnestly to study and makes such progress as a result. he is relieved or manual labour and promoted to the class of learned men. '(pp 5/82)The use of, 'relieved' and, 'promoted' is quite significant, it suggests that the manual work is a chore or burden which can only be relieved entering into a far more superior and worthier class of intellectuals. Knowledge here is being represented as something which is only valuable or worthy when it is based on scholarly level and not a manual or practical one. Again though there appears to be no class division, this is not entirely accurate, similarly, the reader learns that men and women are equals with equal educational opportunities, yet toward the end of the text a strong image of a woman being a figure of negative, corruptible influence is identified. Hythloday personifies Pride as a woman, 'Pride measures her advantages. 'and continues to make the association that Pride is, '.a serpent from hell which twines itself around the hearts of men. '(pp 88)To conclude both More and Baldwin have carefully constructed their texts on the basis to influence or provoke a response from their readers which aligned to their own. This is not in the least unique or exclusive to Renaissance texts in particular, but is found in almost every literary work. However, what defines them as individual is the way in which the represent knowledge to reinforce, emphasise or articulate a view point or character/stereotype, which in turn is praised or undermined. Knowledge can be represented in vast number of ways, and this is what is found amongst Baldwin and Moore's texts. It is clear that these authors were aware of how knowledge can be valued and credited on a number of factors. Its whole credibility and validity is dependant on who is using it. Knowledge, it seems, is at the basis of inequality in these texts and even during the Renaissance era and beyond. It was dependant on class and specific to gender, it was confined to the upper, wealthier social elite and excluded from the lower class masses who were obviously deemed unsuitable or unworthy to be exposed to any level of intellectual education. The Renaissance was certainly a time for knowledge, if knowledge can be restricted to time that is. There were colonial expansions, discoveries of new lands, new people and inevitably new knowledge. It was a time of development and a chance to challenge old conventions and traditions, breaking away from ancestral knowledge and striking out into the unknown. It is this picture, this representation of knowledge that can be found at the foundation of Renaissance literature.""","""Renaissance knowledge and societal influence.""","3591","""The Renaissance period, spanning roughly from the 14th to the 17th centuries, was a time of profound cultural, scientific, and intellectual transformation in Europe. This era marked a significant shift from the medieval worldview to a renewed focus on humanism, art, literature, and science. The pursuit of knowledge during the Renaissance not only brought about groundbreaking advancements in various fields but also had a profound impact on society, shaping values, beliefs, and social structures in ways that continue to resonate in our modern world.  One of the defining characteristics of the Renaissance was the revival of classical learning and the rejection of medieval scholasticism. The recovery and translation of ancient texts, particularly by scholars such as Petrarch and Erasmus, paved the way for a renewed interest in classical languages, literature, and philosophy. Humanism, a key intellectual movement of the time, emphasized the study of human potential, virtue, and individualism. Humanist scholars like Pico della Mirandola and Leonardo Bruni championed the idea of education as a means to cultivate well-rounded individuals capable of critical thinking and moral discernment.  The Renaissance was also a period of significant scientific progress and discovery. The works of pioneering figures such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler revolutionized the understanding of the universe and laid the foundations for modern astronomy. The development of the scientific method, championed by Francis Bacon and René Descartes, heralded a shift towards empirical observation and experimentation as the basis for acquiring knowledge. This empirical approach to understanding the natural world marked a departure from the reliance on traditional authority and dogma that had characterized medieval thought.  The impact of Renaissance knowledge extended beyond the realms of academia and science, influencing various aspects of society including politics, religion, and the arts. The rise of the printing press in the mid-15th century played a crucial role in disseminating knowledge more widely and rapidly than ever before. The publication of books, pamphlets, and newspapers allowed ideas to spread across Europe, fueling debates, sparking controversies, and challenging established beliefs.  In the realm of politics, the Renaissance witnessed the emergence of new forms of governance and political thought. The works of political theorists like Niccolò Machiavelli and Thomas More explored questions of power, justice, and the role of the state. Machiavelli's """"The Prince"""" famously examined the nature of political leadership and the strategies rulers should employ to maintain authority. More's """"Utopia"""" presented a vision of an ideal society based on principles of equality, justice, and communal ownership.  Religion was another area deeply impacted by the intellectual currents of the Renaissance. The era saw the Protestant Reformation, spearheaded by figures such as Martin Luther and John Calvin, challenging the authority of the Catholic Church and sparking religious conflict across Europe. The translation of the Bible into vernacular languages, such as Luther's German translation, made religious texts more accessible to the general population, empowering individuals to interpret scripture for themselves and contributing to the decentralization of religious authority.  Art and literature flourished during the Renaissance, reflecting the period's fascination with humanism, individualism, and the natural world. The works of renowned artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael epitomized the spirit of Renaissance innovation and creativity. Their masterpieces, whether in painting, sculpture, or architecture, celebrated the beauty of the human form, explored new techniques and perspectives, and expressed complex emotions and ideas.  Literature also experienced a golden age during the Renaissance, with writers such as William Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes, and Dante Alighieri producing timeless works that continue to captivate readers today. Shakespeare's plays captured the richness and complexity of human experience, delving into themes of love, power, ambition, and morality. Cervantes's """"Don Quixote"""" satirized chivalric romances and explored themes of truth, fiction, and the nature of reality. Dante's """"Divine Comedy"""" took readers on a journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven, blending theological insight with poetic imagination.  The Renaissance was a period of immense cultural exchange and cross-fertilization, with ideas, art, and knowledge circulating across national boundaries and shaping a shared European identity. The growth of trade, exploration, and colonization expanded horizons and facilitated the exchange of goods, people, and ideas between Europe and the wider world. The influx of exotic goods, technologies, and knowledge from Asia, Africa, and the Americas enriched European societies and fueled a burgeoning global economy.  The legacy of the Renaissance continues to resonate in our contemporary world, influencing our values, beliefs, and institutions. The emphasis on individualism, critical thinking, and human potential that characterized the era laid the groundwork for modern notions of democracy, human rights, and personal freedom. The scientific advancements of the period paved the way for the age of Enlightenment and the rise of empiricism as the foundation of modern science. The cultural achievements of the Renaissance in art, literature, and music continue to inspire and enrich our lives, reminding us of the enduring power of creativity, imagination, and human expression.  In conclusion, the Renaissance was a transformative period in European history that catalyzed a profound renaissance of knowledge, culture, and society. The intellectual achievements of the era, from advancements in science and philosophy to innovations in art and literature, continue to shape our understanding of the world and our place within it. The Renaissance's enduring legacy serves as a testament to the enduring power of human creativity, curiosity, and ingenuity to transcend boundaries, challenge conventions, and forge new paths of discovery and enlightenment.""","1135"
"6179","""The word 'mythology' comes from Ancient Greece and using its derivatives it roughly becomes 'story-telling' in English. Although, myths are stories and many of them focus on the epic deeds of heroes, 'Greek mythology admits a plurality of approaches' and it would be foolish to ignore the importance of the characteristics and the symbolism of the protagonists and antagonists. The intervention of the Olympian deities in Greek myth is a recurring motif, and in many myths they play pivotal roles. Furthermore, the idea of virginity is a major theme in a fair number of ancient Greek myths. In particular, the virgin goddesses Athena, Hestia and Artemis feature dominantly in many of the virgin motif myths: Their sexuality and devotion to it is an antithesis to the Ancient Greek culture; where men dominated society and it was common practice for girls to be married as soon as possible. By paying particular attention to the virgin goddesses and using a variety of sources, in this essay I will explore the figure of the virgin and their relevance in ancient Greek myth. Edmunds, Lowell Approaches to Greek Myth Johns Hopkins University Press p. vii The idea of virginity, or one of the ideas, is that of 'bodily integrity' and Loven states the word 'virgin refers to a girl or to a young woman who has not yet had sexual experiences' whilst maintaining that for males, the idea of celibacy is more appropriate than the idea of virginity. However, that is not to say that there are not male virgins in Greek myth, with the mortal, Artemis-worshipping Hippolytus being a perfect paradigm of a male virgin. Furthermore, there considered two types of virgin in ancient Greek myth; passive or active. A passive virgin is one who does not actively maintain their virginity. An active virgin is one who will defend, if need be, their virginity should anyone threaten it. The aforementioned three virgin goddesses are perfect models to enhance the distinction between the two types of virginity. Loven, L. L Aspects of Women in Antiquity, Sweden p.5/8 Loven p.5/8 Artemis, goddess of the hunt and the wild, is arguably the best example of an active virgin, as she 'represents the impulse to asceticism and chastity.' Not only does she defend her 'hallowed purity' numerous times, for example against Actaeon, but she also despises fellow goddess Aphrodite, a deity who is more than liberal when it comes to sexual relations. Greenwood says there is a 'mutual jealousy and hostility' between the two, a point which is easily comprehensible considering that the two deities are complete opposites. Michael Grant points out that 'she plays an inglorious role in the Iliad' and the reason for this may be down to the fact that 'she was, to the Greeks, the goddess of a conquered race.' However, the fact there are at least four myths revolving around Artemis and the defence of her virginity, I feel, highlights how she was an important figure in ancient Greek society; as part of her duty 'she watches over women at childbirth' and 'the virginity of Artemis in her tenderest aspect makes her specially gentle to the very young maiden.' Greenwood, L Aspects of Euripidean Tragedy, Cambridge University Press p. 3 Morford, Lenardon Eighth Edition Classical Mythology Oxford University Press p.13 Greenwood p. 5/8 Grant, M Myths of the Greeks and Romans, The New English Library Limited, London p.25/8 Grant p.25/8 Harrison, Jane Myth of Greece and Rome. Ernest Benn Limited, London p. 1 Harrison p.6 If there is any median between active and passive virginity then that median is Athena. 'Next after Zeus himself in Olympian precedence comes Athena the Grey-Eyed', her virginity could be considered a surprising characteristic considering her pre-eminence after Zeus and as I have previously mentioned, ancient Greek society far from favoured women. However, it must be pointed out, that she was a deity and a powerful one at that so she was bound to be revered and worshipped beyond others. Although not as active as Artemis, Athena did defend her virginity against Hephaestus, the god of craft and smiths, who attempted to rape her. This could be seen as a reversal to the idea of male dominance in Greek society, however, Athena was a god of war, along with Ares, and Morford & Lenardon state that 'the masculinity of her virgin nature sprung ultimately not from the female, but the male.' Although virginal, Athena had a particularly close relationship with Zeus and was a result was 'his favourite daughter' as well as being the patron of the hero Odysseus. I believe this shows how she was open minded, furthered by the fact that she merely ran from Hephaestus rather than kill him as Artemis would have done, unlike the aggressive Artemis and Hestia, who did her utmost to avoid men. Morford, Lenardon p.66 Morford, Lenardon p.66 Morford, Lenardon p.65/8 The passive example is the goddess of the hearth, Hestia. Unfortunately, there are very little remaining stories involving Hestia, and as such it is difficult to gauge the importance of her role as a virgin. However, we do know she, like Artemis, was not swayed by the works of Aphrodite and swore to retain her virginity. Furthermore, as every family hearth was her altar and she received the first offering of any sacrifice in a house she is arguably a pivotal god to Greek society. Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty, love and marriage was in stark disparity to the virginal goddesses, a point which is reinforced with a reference to Harrison: 'In marked contrast to Athena stands. Aphrodite.' In ancient Greek myth Aphrodite caused the death of Hippolytus; Hippolytus was a favourite of Artemis and he only worshipped her and as a result he refused to revere Athena as he led a life of chastity. As a consequence Aphrodite set in motion the events told in Hippolytus, which led to the brutal death of Hippolytus as a result of his rejection of Phaedra. Harrison p.5/8 It is in Hippolytus, after the protagonist is told of Phaedra's love for him, that we can see an ancient Greek outlook on women, although admittedly, it is a strong view; ''Tis clear from this how great a curse a woman is', eBook translated by E. P. Coleridge found at URL Furthered by the fact that Hippolytus, a male, is arguably the most famous mortal virgin in ancient Greek myth and that three prominent Olympian deities are virginal, it could be argued that the idea of virginity, which requires devotion, is generally an idea beyond that of the typical ancient Greek female, who in her culture was perceived as the lustful gender. As a result, it could be stated that the virginity of the goddesses acts only to further separate them from the mortal woman. However, Greenwood argues that is not Hippolytus' chastity that leads him to which 'his indignant horror is due. Union with his father's wife would be both adulterous and incestuous and all respectable Greeks' would see such acts as terrible offences. Even with this taken into consideration, Hippolytus' condemnation of women as a whole, not just Phaedra would surely render such a point obsolete. Greenwood p.7 In stark contrast with the ancient Greek cultural view of women as the 'lustful gender' is the fact that acts of rape more or less are always committed by males (aside from the rape of Anchises by Aphrodite, which once again reiterates her whorish nature). On the other hand, three serial rapists in ancient Greek myth are Zeus, king of the gods, Apollo, 'second only to Zeus' and Poseidon, 'the equal of either Athena or Apollo' whose acts have often been said to be symbolic of the notion of male dominance. At this point, it must be highlighted that an act of rape, although far from being positive, was not seen in same light of negativity it is today, which as a result meant that being characterised as a raping deity is no where near the unpleasant characterisation it would be today. Rape was the primary threat to the virgin figure in Greek myth; although never were the virginal goddesses successfully raped, which once again further separates them from the mortal woman, who was frequently the victims in ancient Greek myth. This point would also further support the idea of male dominance in ancient Greek culture. Harrison p.9 Harrison p.4 To conclude, taking into consideration all the previously stated points, it is my view that the figure of the virgin in ancient Greek myth is a literary symbol used by the male ancient Greek writer to represent 'bodily integrity', or a level of 'purity' that cannot be attained, or maintained by the average ancient Greek woman. This point is supported by how the three most renowned virgins are all female deities and not mortals. A further condemnation of the ancient Greek female is shown by the threat of rape and in particular the threat of rape to virgins, which is, in my view as well as others, a symbolic motif subconsciously highlighting the ancient Greek cultural belief of the dominant male and the weaker female.""","""Virginity in Greek mythology""","1987","""In Greek mythology, the concept of virginity holds a complex and nuanced significance that extends beyond mere physical purity. The portrayal of virginity in ancient Greek tales reflects societal norms, gender dynamics, and the power dynamics inherent in relationships. From goddesses embodying eternal virginity to mortal women challenged by their virtue, virginity in Greek mythology serves as a rich tapestry interwoven with themes of purity, independence, and sovereignty.  One of the most iconic figures associated with virginity in Greek mythology is the goddess Athena. Known for her wisdom, courage, and strategic prowess, Athena is often depicted as the epitome of virginity. Referred to as a parthenos, which means """"virgin"""" in Greek, Athena is revered for her unwavering commitment to her independence and self-reliance. Unlike other goddesses who succumb to the desires of male gods, Athena navigates the realms of power with autonomy and authority, embodying the essence of virginity as a symbol of empowerment rather than limitation.  Another prominent virgin goddess in Greek mythology is Artemis, the goddess of the hunt and wilderness. Revered for her connection to nature and her fierce protection of her chastity, Artemis represents the untamed and wild aspects of virginity. As a virgin goddess, Artemis is fiercely independent and intolerant of any attempts to compromise her autonomy. Her virginity is not a sign of weakness or lack but a declaration of her sovereignty and strength, challenging traditional notions of female subservience and submission.  In contrast to the divine embodiment of virginity, mortal women in Greek mythology often grapple with the expectations and consequences associated with their virtue. Stories of mortal women like Atalanta, a renowned huntress who swore to remain a virgin, highlight the challenges and complexities of upholding one's purity in a society where women's worth is often tied to their chastity. Atalanta's determination to preserve her virginity is not just a personal choice but a radical act of defiance against societal norms that seek to control and diminish women's agency.  The myth of Persephone, the daughter of Demeter and queen of the Underworld, also sheds light on the intricacies of virginity in Greek mythology. Persephone's abduction by Hades and subsequent marriage to him while in the Underworld is a poignant tale of a woman's agency being compromised against her will. Persephone's innocence and purity are tainted by the forces of fate and power, illustrating how the concept of virginity can be weaponized to exert control and dominance over women.  The theme of virginity in Greek mythology is further explored through the tragic story of Psyche, a mortal woman who incurs the wrath of Aphrodite due to her extraordinary beauty. Psyche's virtue and purity are put to the test through a series of trials orchestrated by Aphrodite, ultimately leading to her reunion with Eros, the god of love. Psyche's journey serves as a cautionary tale about the precarious nature of virginity and the dangers of jealousy and insecurity that can arise from its perceived threat.  Despite the diversity of representations surrounding virginity in Greek mythology, one common thread that emerges is the idea of agency and autonomy. Whether embodied by powerful goddesses like Athena and Artemis or mortal women like Atalanta and Psyche, virginity in Greek mythology is a symbol of self-determination and resilience in the face of adversity. It challenges traditional notions of purity as a passive and fragile state, instead emphasizing the strength and courage required to maintain one's integrity and independence in a world fraught with challenges and temptations.  In conclusion, the concept of virginity in Greek mythology transcends mere physical purity to encompass a multifaceted spectrum of meanings and implications. From the divine embodiment of virginity in goddesses like Athena and Artemis to the mortal struggles of women like Atalanta, Persephone, and Psyche, the myths and legends of ancient Greece offer a profound exploration of the complexities surrounding virtue, agency, and power dynamics. By delving into these stories, we gain insight into the enduring significance of virginity as a symbol of strength, independence, and resilience in the face of adversity and societal expectations.""","846"

The studio work will lead to a cramming project - a project which focuses on jamming more buildings into an already occupied and currently used site, allowing the site to reach its maximum economic potential. We have been given a choice of three sites in Oxford. My chosen site is St. Catherine's College - part of Oxford University. The idea behind this project is to question beauty against the usefulness of a site. St. Catherine's College in Oxford was designed by the Danish architect Arne Jacobsen. The college is situated on the east side of Oxford, on the bank of the River Cherwell. The college is a contrast in design to most the other colleges, in that it was built hundreds of years later. It was built between 962 and 964. The buildings have of a modern design which is based on the older traditional quadrangle layout of the other colleges. Jacobsen's design of St. Catherine's ranged from the buildings to the furniture and cutlery used inside. Arne Jacobsen took his own approach to the quadrangle based college. Although designed in a different manner, it consists of the main elements - a central quad with lawn, with two rows of student's rooms either side, a garden, chapel and a dining hall. A main feature of the design is a large lily pond. Due to this unique design, the architecture of the college creates a feeling of space, light and Eiermann and Sep Ruf Pavilions for the Federal Republic of Germany at the world's fair in Brussels 95/84-95/88 at Universitat housing at the University of East Anglia, Norwich.

These are shrinkage loads, thermal loads, settlement loads and dynamic loads. Other stresses which should be taken into account are linked to the specific materials used in the building (Gauld, 995/8). Structural properties of materialsCharacteristics and properties of each material will also be important to be known. These include the strength, stability, and serviceability of such materials. The main materials used at St. Catherine's are concrete. Concretes structural systems will need to be observed.""","""Architecture and Building Technology Analysis""","805","""Architecture and building technology analysis is essential in the modern construction world to ensure that structures are not only aesthetically pleasing but also safe, sustainable, and functional. Through a thorough examination of architectural designs, materials, and construction methods, experts can assess the performance, efficiency, and durability of buildings. This analysis involves evaluating the technical aspects of a project to optimize its design and construction processes, resulting in improved functionality, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact.  One key aspect of architecture and building technology analysis is the examination of building materials. Different materials have varying properties that can impact a structure's durability, energy efficiency, maintenance requirements, and overall performance. For example, the choice between traditional materials like concrete and steel versus newer materials like carbon fiber or recycled materials can greatly influence a building's sustainability and environmental footprint. Analyzing the properties and performance of these materials helps architects and engineers make informed decisions that balance aesthetics with functionality.  Another crucial component of architecture and building technology analysis is the evaluation of construction techniques and methods. Advances in technology have revolutionized the way buildings are designed and constructed, with innovations such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), modular construction, 3D printing, and sustainable building practices shaping the industry. By analyzing these technologies, experts can determine the most efficient and cost-effective methods for constructing buildings while ensuring structural integrity and compliance with building codes and regulations.  Sustainability is a growing concern in architecture, and building technology analysis plays a vital role in evaluating the environmental impact of construction projects. By assessing factors such as energy efficiency, water usage, waste management, and carbon footprint, experts can recommend design strategies and building systems that minimize the environmental impact of buildings. This could include incorporating passive design strategies, using renewable energy sources, optimizing building orientation for natural lighting and ventilation, and implementing green building certifications like LEED or BREEAM.  Moreover, architecture and building technology analysis also involves assessing the functionality and usability of a building. This includes considerations such as space planning, interior layout, accessibility, and user experience. By analyzing these aspects, architects and designers can create spaces that are not only visually appealing but also practical and conducive to the needs of the occupants. This user-centric approach ensures that buildings are not just architectural statements but also functional spaces that enhance the quality of life for their users.  In conclusion, architecture and building technology analysis is essential for creating sustainable, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing structures. By carefully evaluating building materials, construction techniques, sustainability practices, and user needs, experts can optimize the design and construction processes to create buildings that are both visually striking and functional.

Also clearly shown from comparison of the IR spectrum of RJP1 and RJP2, is the disappearance of the strong carbonyl the presence of the strong/broad alcohol should not be present as this should have reacted and become the second ether group in this molecule. This suggests that the reaction has not occurred or is still impure. The NMR of RJP3 suggests a failed reaction further as it contains nearly an exact match of proton shifts and integrals to that of the NMR of RJP2 and does not show any chemical shifts for the presence of the protons k, l, m and n. If the reaction had succeeded then there should at least be an extra chemical shift around ~. ppm which would correspond to proton n. Therefore, my deduction is that the reaction in step failed.

Mechanisms:""","""Chemical Synthesis and Purification Techniques""","588","""Chemical synthesis is a fundamental process in chemistry that involves combining different chemical compounds to create new substances. This process is crucial in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, materials science, and agriculture. To ensure the purity and quality of the synthesized compounds, purification techniques play a vital role in the final product. Let's delve into the methods and importance of chemical synthesis and purification techniques.  Chemical synthesis involves a series of steps starting with the selection of reactants, followed by reaction conditions, and purification of the final product. One commonly used method in chemical synthesis is the use of reagents which are chemicals used to bring about a specific reaction to yield the desired product. Organic synthesis, for example, often employs reagents like Grignard reagents or organometallic compounds to create complex organic molecules.  Purification techniques are essential to isolate and remove impurities from the synthesized compounds. One widely used technique is chromatography, which separates different compounds based on their affinity for a stationary phase. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) are popular methods for separating and analyzing compounds based on their physical and chemical properties.  Another common purification technique is recrystallization, where the synthesized compound is dissolved in a suitable solvent and then allowed to cool slowly to form pure crystals while impurities remain in the solution. Distillation is used to separate compounds based on differences in boiling points, while extraction uses solvents to separate components based on their solubility.  The choice of purification technique depends on various factors such as the type of compound, impurities present, and desired purity level. For pharmaceuticals, where purity is critical for safety and efficacy, techniques like crystallization or HPLC are commonly employed. In contrast, industrial chemicals may use distillation or extraction for large-scale purification.  Apart from traditional techniques, modern advancements in chemical synthesis and purification include computational modeling, automation, and green chemistry practices. Computational chemistry allows researchers to optimize reaction conditions and predict molecular interactions, saving time and resources in the synthesis process. Automation, through robotics and artificial intelligence, accelerates the screening of reaction conditions and purification steps for efficiency.  Green chemistry focuses on developing sustainable practices to minimize waste and reduce environmental impact during synthesis and purification processes. Techniques like microwave-assisted synthesis, which reduces reaction times and energy consumption, and solvent-free purification methods contribute to environmentally friendly practices in chemical synthesis.  In conclusion, chemical synthesis and purification techniques are integral processes in creating pure and high-quality compounds for various applications. The selection of appropriate synthesis methods and purification techniques is crucial to achieving desired outcomes in terms of purity, yield, and efficiency. As technology advances, researchers continue to explore innovative approaches to enhance chemical synthesis and purification, paving the way for safer, more efficient, and sustainable chemical processes.""","558"
"3138","""Following Greg's referral to Occupational the ward, a risk assessment was carried out and then intervention planning could begin. Four over arching aims were written for Greg based on his strengths and needs identified using the Model Of Human with Greg, his mother, Greg's Psychiatrist and Care Co-ordinator. This team approach ensured that everybody was working towards the same aims. Using a client centred approach, Greg was encouraged to have maximum input into the goal setting process in the hope that this would encourage and motivate him to engage in, is a legal document which outlines procedures and allows patients to be sectioned by a doctor for assessment and the role of a Care Co-ordinator. The CPA involves both Greg and his carers in his care planning, ensures interventions are suited to his needs and promotes communication between all individuals and agencies involved in his care. All patients should have their mental health needs identified and be offered effective treatment; referrals to specialist services should be made if is currently in a medium secure mental health unit. The unit is thirty miles from his mother's house; where possible patient's are kept close to home so that links with friends, family and the community can be maintained or rebuilt. The NSF advises that patient's should live in the least restrictive environment consistent with the need to protect themselves and the public (DOH, 999). The CPA outlines processes to be used with patients. Following the referral a risk assessment was carried out with Greg to identify the risks to himself and others; and also the factors that may put Greg at risk of relapse. Relapse prevention is a psychosocial intervention which looks to identify the early warning signs of relapse and develop action plans in case of crisis (Harris et al, 002); the warning signs and action plans are recorded in Greg's care plan. In the unit Greg is highly monitored but relapse prevention will become increasingly important as he begins to self-manage his care. Under the CPA each patient has a Care Co-ordinator; it was decided that the Charge Nurse Jim would be best for this role as Greg has known him since admission and spends time on the ward with him. Jim's role is to promote good communication between Greg, his family, and the professional team; he is also responsible for ensuring that the care plan is regularly reviewed to suit Greg's changing needs and behaviours (Creek, 002). The care plan also ensures that risk assessment is up to date in order to protect Greg and everybody who works with him. Greg is on an enhanced CPA as he has multiple care needs and is involved with several agencies including the criminal justice system (Creek, 002). Greg has also been placed on the supervision register by his psychiatrist; the supervision register identifies people with mental illness who may be at significant risk to themselves or others. Greg's history of fire setting and non compliance with medication make him a significant risk. Thorough multi-disciplinary risk assessment must take place before the decision can be made to remove him from the register (Creek, 002). When Greg leaves the secure unit in the future and is able to self-manage his mental health then he is likely to be reduced to a standard CPA as he is more stable and less agencies will be involved in his care. The main person for the OT to liaise with is Jim. As care co-ordinator he communicates with the rest of the team and has the most involvement in Greg's care plan, communication with Greg's Psychiatrist will also be needed. Before his latest admission Greg was living independently with the support of the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT). Even though Greg is not due to be discharged, he is known to the CMHT and will be referred to them at the time of discharge (Crepeau, 003). Greg will also receive support from a social worker regarding benefits and accommodation. Greg's mother visits him monthly and he has a younger sister who has not visited since his admission a year ago. Even though he is not in close contact with them, liaison with Greg's family is an important part of his care. Greg can be very isolated and does not communicate with many people on the ward. He has recently been meeting with the Chaplain and is beginning to assist him with the running of services. It may be worth communicating with the Chaplain if Greg is being open with him; although this may raise confidentiality issues as he is not a member of the professional team. Communication with the forensic services will also be needed to stay up to date with Greg's conviction and section status. The section 1 prevents him from leaving the hospital (DOH, 999), this imposes limitations on treatment plans and further social inclusion. Much of Greg's future OT intervention and vocational training will depend on when he is discharged and where to, and whether he remains under a section of the Mental Health Act.""","""Mental health care planning and management""","974","""Mental health care planning and management play a crucial role in ensuring the well-being and recovery of individuals facing mental health challenges. This comprehensive process involves assessing, identifying, and implementing strategies to address the needs of individuals experiencing mental health issues. Effective care planning and management require a holistic approach that considers the unique circumstances and preferences of each individual, aiming to provide personalized care and support. By focusing on prevention, intervention, and ongoing support, mental health care planning and management strive to enhance the quality of life and promote positive mental health outcomes.  Assessment forms the foundation of mental health care planning and management. Through thorough evaluation, healthcare professionals can gather essential information about an individual's mental health status, including symptoms, triggers, strengths, challenges, and goals. These assessments may involve clinical interviews, standardized questionnaires, observation, and collaboration with the individual and their support system. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the individual's mental health needs and circumstances, healthcare providers can develop personalized care plans tailored to promote recovery and well-being.  Once the assessment is complete, the next step involves creating a comprehensive care plan. This plan outlines specific goals, interventions, and strategies aimed at addressing the individual's mental health needs. Goals may include improving coping skills, managing symptoms, enhancing social support, or addressing underlying issues contributing to mental health challenges. Interventions can range from therapy sessions and medication management to lifestyle modifications and community resources utilization. The care plan should be collaborative, involving the individual, healthcare providers, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure a coordinated and effective approach to care.  Effective mental health care planning and management also prioritize regular monitoring and evaluation of the care plan. Monitoring involves tracking the individual's progress toward their goals, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, and adjusting the care plan as needed. Regular check-ins, assessments, and feedback sessions enable healthcare providers to identify any challenges or changes in the individual's mental health status promptly. By staying actively engaged and responsive, healthcare providers can ensure that the care plan remains relevant and supportive of the individual's evolving needs.  In addition to personalized care planning, the management of mental health care also involves coordination of services and resources to provide comprehensive support. This may include referrals to mental health specialists, coordination with primary care providers, collaboration with community organizations, and advocacy for access to necessary services. Effective communication and collaboration among healthcare providers, support networks, and the individual receiving care are essential for ensuring a cohesive and integrated approach to mental health care.  Furthermore, mental health care planning and management extend beyond clinical interventions to encompass broader factors that influence mental well-being. Social determinants of health, such as housing stability, access to education, employment opportunities, and social support networks, play a significant role in shaping mental health outcomes. Addressing these social determinants may involve connecting individuals with social services, vocational support, housing assistance, and other resources to create a supportive environment conducive to recovery and well-being.  Moreover, mental health care planning and management should also prioritize the involvement of family members and caregivers in the care process. Family support can be a significant asset in promoting recovery and maintaining overall well-being for individuals facing mental health challenges. Involving family members in care planning discussions, providing education and resources on mental health, and fostering open communication can strengthen the support system around the individual receiving care.  In conclusion, mental health care planning and management are essential components of providing effective and compassionate care for individuals with mental health concerns. By incorporating assessment, personalized care planning, monitoring, coordination of services, and attention to social determinants of health, healthcare providers can support individuals on their journey toward recovery and well-being. A holistic and collaborative approach that values the individual's unique experiences and perspectives can enhance the effectiveness and impact of mental health care interventions, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for those in need.""","756"
"141","""This paper describes and compares electron transport by mitochondria in eukaryotes with electron transport by various different bacteria. From studying these various forms of electron transport in respiration, it was concluded that electron transport in bacteria and in mitochondria are similar in the following respects: the electron carriers are arranged in an order of increasingly more positive reduction potential and the energy released in electron transport is utilised to generate a proton motive force, used to synthesise ATP. (Madiganal. 26-27) However, differences are present in the numbers and types of electron carriers used and likewise the complexes pumping protons.The electron transport in respiration is a process by which electrons are transferred from an electron donor, such as NADH, to an electron acceptor, for example oxygen, through a sequence of membrane-associated electron carriers. This transfer releases energy, allowing for the pumping of protons across the cell membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient. The resulting proton motive force allows for the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. Although details such as electron carriers used differ, this general process is present in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes as a form of producing ATP. For example, bacteria that have electron transport chains very similar to mitochondria's include Rickettsia prowazekii and Paracoccus denitrificans. As will be subsequently described, the former is considered to be descendant of the bacterium that was incorporated into the eukaryotic cell, now a mitochondrion. Bacteria that have electron transport chains less similar to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, for example those using different electron donors including hydrogen oxidising bacteria and sulfur oxidising bacteria, are also considered in this essay among others. In addition, anaerobic respiration in bacteria, with nitrate and sulfur as a final electron acceptors are also described, including comparison with the electron transport chain in mitochondria. Finally, a bacterium that does not use an electron transport chain is briefly described to illustrate the diversity found in the bacterial respiration system and that an electron transport chain is not essential for ATP synthesis. Eukaryotes, Rickettsia prowazekii and Paracoccus denitrificansIn Eukaryotes, electron transport occurs within large proteins present in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons are transported by these protein complexes from oxygen, the final electron acceptor in aerobic respiration. NADH is a high energy molecule due to the high transfer potential of electrons, produced by carbon fuels oxidised in the Krebs cycle. This electron motive force is converted into a proton motive force by three electron driven proton pumps in the inner mitochondrial membrane: NADH-Q oxidoreductase, Q-cytochrome c oxidoreductase and cytochrome c oxidase. These protein complexes contain several redox centres, including quinones, flavins, iron-sulfur clusters, hemes and copper ions. (Bergal. 92) Fig. on the left shows the electron transport system where electrons are transferred from substrates to oxygen. This is a scheme typical of mitochondria. In addition to the three proton pumps mentioned above, the mitochondrial electron transport chain consists of another complex called succinate-Q reductase, which links the transport chain to the Krebs cycle. Fig. on the right represents the membrane, showing the location of these key electron carriers, whose redox centres are outlined in Fig.. (Madiganal. 27) Fig. is a diagram of the membrane of Paracoccus denitrificans, but it could be likewise the inner membrane of the mitochondria. A mitochondrion and this bacterium contain the same transporter protein because the mitochondrion was originally a free-living bacterium, which was incorporated into the cell by an endosymbiotic event. (Bergal. 92) The bacterium that is said to be the most closely related to mitochondria is Rickettsia prowazekii. Analysis of the genes in the bacterium in contrast with the mitochondrion's has allowed for this conclusion to be reached. (Nature, 998) Hence, R. prowazekii also has the same electron carriers as mitochondria. The only obvious difference between them is that in the mitochondrion hydrogen ions are pumped into the intermembrane space, whereas in the bacterium protons are pumped into the environment. The second membrane around mitochondria appeared when the ancestor of the bacterium R. prowazekii was engulfed by the eukaryotic cell. Although the electron transport chain of these two bacteria show close similarities to that of the mitochondria, many other bacteria have different electron transport chains. While the basic mechanism, in which a proton motive force is obtained leading to the synthesis of ATP is very similar, the numbers and types of electron carriers involved are different. For example, in Escherichia coli, cytochromes c and aa are not present and the electrons instead go directly from cytochrome b to o or d. (Madiganal. 26) Hydrogen OxidationChemolithotrophs are organisms that use inorganic electron donors. A number of these organisms use hydrogen as an electron donor. In aerobic hydrogen oxidising bacteria, hydrogen is oxidised by oxygen, a reaction catalysed by an enzyme called hydrogenase. Electrons are transferred from hydrogen to a quinone acceptor and then through a sequence of cytochromes until ultimately oxygen is reduced to water. As in all electron transport chains, this process results with the formation of a proton motive force. Fig. illustrates the electron transport chain of a hydrogen oxidising bacteria, such as Ralstonia eutropha that contain two hydrogenases. As can be seen in the diagram, one hydrogenase is membrane associated and the other is soluble. The membrane bound hydrogenase is the one that is involved in electron transport. (Madiganal. 68) Unlike the electron transport chain in mitochondria, it is a H molecule that is immediately involved in the electron transport chain, not carried by NAD+. Also, the chain in hydrogen oxidising bacteria lack flavoproteins and iron-sulfur proteins. However, the general structure and mechanism by which the proton motive force is reached is remarkably similar to the mitochondria's. Oxidation of Reduced Sulfur CompoundsReduced sulfur compounds can also be used as electron donors. Most common of these are hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur and thiosulfate. The diagram overleaf, Fig., describes an electron transport chain of a sulfur oxidising bacteria. Electrons from sulfur compounds enter the electron transport chain at flavoprotein, which then flow to quinone, cytochrome b, cytochrome c, cytochrome aa and then to the final electron acceptor, oxygen. H+ is pumped out of the cell at two points of the chain, at the quinone and cytochrome aa. If the electron donor used is thiosulfate or elemental sulfur, electrons enter the chain at cytochrome c. (Madiganal. 70) Again, like the electron transport chain of the hydrogen oxidising bacteria, an iron-sulfur protein is missing, compared to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Iron oxidationAerobic oxidation of iron from is made use in a few bacteria such as Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. The respiratory chain of T. ferrooxidans contains cytochrome c and cytochrome a and a periplasmic protein containing copper, called rusticyanin. (Madiganal. 72) In the transport chain, the ferrous iron is oxidised to Fe + by rusticyanin. The electron is then transferred to cytochrome c and subsequently cytochrome a is reduced. Since respiration is aerobic, the final electron acceptor is again oxygen, which is reduced to water when it accepts the two electrons from cytochrome a. Again the key cytochromes, c and a, are present as shown in Fig.. Compared with electron transport in mitochondria, and the transport chains studied thus far, quinone is not present. Also, flavoproteins are missing. Both iron oxidising bacteria and sulfur oxidising bacteria do not contain any iron-sulfur proteins since these elements are used as electron donors and the electron transporters should be present in increasing reduction potential. Ammonia and nitrite oxidationSome bacteria use inorganic nitrogen compounds such as ammonia and nitrite as electron donors. These compounds are oxidised aerobically by chemolithotrophic nitrifying bacteria. These bacteria can be classified roughly in two groups: one oxidising NH to NO - and the other oxidising NO - to NO -. Fig. shows an electron transport chain of an ammonia oxidising bacteria. First, ammonia is oxidised by ammonia water. Then another enzyme called hydroxylamine NH OH to NO -, removing four electrons. Two of these electrons and two protons are used to reduce one atom of oxygen into water. As shown in the oxidise NH - to NH -. This electron transport chain is much simpler compared to that of the ammonia oxidising bacteria. Electrons are transferred to cytochrome c and then to cytochrome aa and finally oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor, is reduced. (Madiganal. 74) Anaerobic respiration:Nitrate as a final electron acceptorIn anaerobic respiration, a final electron acceptor other than oxygen is used. Common electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration are inorganic nitrogen compounds. The case considered NO - as an electron acceptor in Escherichia coli. On the right, Fig. difference of this electron transport chain from the ones studied so far is that a membrane associated protein called Hmc is present. This protein complex transfers electrons from hydrogenase across the cell membrane. The electron transport system considered in Fig. uses an organic compound, lactate, as an electron donor. Lactate is converted into pyruvate, by LDH, whereby H are transported across to hydrogenase. This is the single point at which H+ are produced to generate a proton motive force. Then electrons are transferred to cytochrome c and then Hmc, a cytochrome complex which, as mentioned previously, transports electrons across the membrane to the iron-sulfur protein. Finally the electrons are accepted by a sulfite to produce sulfide. Looking at Fig., it seems that sulfate is not directly involved and APS is accepting the two electrons from the iron-sulfur protein. What actually is happens is ATP gains a sulfur moiety along with the loss of two phosphates. Then with the gain of two electrons AMP and sulfite is produced. The next six electrons from the iron-sulfur protein reduces sulfite to sulfide. (Madiganal. 80) Apart from the iron-sulfur protein and a cytochrome c, this electron transport chain comprise of electron carriers that are not present in mitochondrial electron transport. Also, hydrogen ions are only pumped out by a hydrogenase in this sulfate reducing bacteria, unlike mitochondria which has three proton pumps. ATP production without electron transportAn unusual fermentation is carried out by Propionigenium modestum, a bacterium that ferments succinate. This bacterium is very specialised to fermenting its particular substrate, and only a very restricted group carry it out. It is interesting to compare the process of ATP formation of P. modestum with that of the mitochondria, since due to such specialisation, it is expected that it will be very different. As expected, the process of ATP formation is completely unlike the mitochondria's. What is surprising is that not even electron transport occurs. However, ATP is formed like in mitochondria, due to an electrochemical gradient, although it is produced by sodium ions and not protons. Sodium ions are pumped out of the the energy produced by decarboxylating succinate. This then creates an accumulation of sodium ions outside the cell, which can be used by the Na+ ATPase to form ATP. (Madiganal. 94) Hence due to specialisation, this bacterium can be so different from mitochondria and other common bacteria to have no electron transport chain. ConclusionAlthough only a fraction of bacteria have been considered in this essay, it has allowed for the diversity of processes which exist to produce ATP to be illustrated, from bacteria that have electron transport chains very similar to mitochondrial electron transport such as in R. prowazekii and P. denitrificans to those that have a very different electron transport chain, such as a sulfur reducing bacterium. According to Brock's Biology of Microorganisms: 'several features are characteristic of all electron transport chains and can be summarized as follows: The presence of a series of membrane-associated electron carriers arranged in order of increasingly more positive E '. An alternation in the chain of electron-only and hydrogen-atom only carriers Generation of a proton motive force as a result of charge separation across the membrane, acidic outside and alkaline inside.' (26~27) However, if the few types electron transport chains studied in this essay are to be considered, it can be said that many of the bacterial electron transport chain have some common electron carriers with mitochondria. For example, flavoproteins are not only present in mitochondria but also in E. coli and some hydrogen oxidising bacteria. Moreover, in E. coli, iron sulfur proteins are also present. However, by far the most common electron transporter was cytochrome c. All the electron transport chains considered in this essay contained some form of a cytochrome. It was surprising to discover that there is an organism that does not use an electron transport chain. The electron transport chain was possibly lost through evolution, where using a certain substrate meant that it was more efficient to use another method of ATP formation than the usual electron transport chain to produce a proton motive force. Nevertheless, the similarities of electron transport chain between all other bacteria suggest that the electron transport chain of the bacteria studied and indeed the mitochondria have a common lineage, but due to selective pressures, such as availability of various oxidation and reduction agents, certain changes have been favoured over others.""","""Electron Transport in Respiration""","2903","""Electron transport plays a pivotal role in the process of respiration, a fundamental biological mechanism responsible for generating energy in living organisms. This intricate process involves the movement of electrons along a series of protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electron transport is the final stage in aerobic respiration, following glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, where the majority of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) – the cell's primary energy currency – is produced. Understanding the mechanics of electron transport is crucial in comprehending how living organisms harness energy from nutrients for their survival and metabolic functions.  At the heart of electron transport lies the electron transport chain (ETC), a complex assembly of protein complexes and coenzymes that facilitate the stepwise transfer of electrons. The ETC consists of four main protein complexes – Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), Complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex), and Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) – along with two mobile electron carriers, ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q) and cytochrome c. These components work in harmony to shuttle electrons from electron donors to the final electron acceptor, oxygen.  The journey of electrons in the ETC begins with the reduction of NADH and FADH2 – electron carriers loaded with high-energy electrons – resulting from the previous stages of respiration. Complex I receives electrons from NADH generated during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Upon receiving the electrons, Complex I pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient.  From Complex I, electrons are transferred to ubiquinone, which shuttles them to Complex III. Complex III passes the electrons to cytochrome c, a soluble protein located in the intermembrane space. As electrons move through Complex III, protons are pumped across the membrane, contributing further to the proton gradient.  Cytochrome c then delivers the electrons to Complex IV, where they eventually combine with molecular oxygen (O2) and protons to form water. This final step in the ETC is accompanied by the release of energy that is used to pump additional protons across the membrane by Complex IV. The establishment of a proton gradient and the subsequent flow of protons back into the mitochondrial matrix via ATP synthase drives the synthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate.  The efficiency of electron transport is highlighted by the concept of chemiosmosis, where the electrochemical gradient generated by the proton pumping complexes drives the production of ATP. This coupling of electron transport and ATP synthesis is a fundamental principle in bioenergetics, illustrating how living organisms optimize the energy contained within organic molecules for various cellular functions.  Despite its importance in energy production, electron transport is not without its challenges. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), byproducts of electron leakage from the ETC, can damage cellular components if not neutralized by antioxidant defenses. The presence of certain inhibitors or mutations in the ETC components can disrupt electron flow, leading to energy depletion and metabolic dysfunction. Diseases linked to ETC dysfunction, such as mitochondrial myopathies, highlight the critical role of electron transport in maintaining cellular homeostasis.  Furthermore, the electron transport process is tightly regulated to ensure smooth operation and energy balance within the cell. Feedback mechanisms control the activity of the ETC complexes based on cellular energy demands and environmental conditions. This regulation helps prevent energy wastage and maintains metabolic stability under varying physiological circumstances.  In conclusion, electron transport in respiration is a highly orchestrated process that underpins the energy economy of living organisms. Through the intricate interplay of protein complexes, coenzymes, and electron carriers, cells efficiently convert the chemical energy stored in nutrients into ATP, the universal energy currency. Delving into the mechanisms of electron transport not only elucidates the intricacies of cellular metabolism but also highlights the interconnection between bioenergetics and physiological health. By unraveling the mysteries of electron transport, researchers continue to uncover new avenues for understanding metabolic diseases, optimizing energy production, and enhancing human health and well-being.""","838"
"156","""Foucault's first volume of The History of Sexuality begins with an examination of the ways in which our contemporary interpretation of sexuality has been shaped by historical trends. He opens, with a chapter entitled 'We 'Other Victorians,'' sarcastically narrating: 'For a long time, the story goes, we supported a Victorian regime, and we continue to be dominated by it even today. Thus the image of the imperial prude is emblazoned on our restrained, mute, and hypocritical sexuality.' (Foucault, 998: ). Foucault labels this set of cultural attitudes about and beliefs toward 'our restrained, mute, and hypocritical sexuality' the 'repressive hypothesis.' He swiftly undercuts the widely-held belief about Victorian repressiveness with both documentation and theorisation that in the nineteenth century there was the multiplication of discourse concerning sex in the field of exercise of power itself: '.an institutional incitement to speak about it, and to do so more and more; a determination on the part of the agencies of power to hear it spoken about, and to cause it to speak through explicit articulation and endlessl accumulated detail.' (Foucault, 998:8)This Foucauldian notion of a constant 'incitement to speak about' sex is the result of what he names a 'discursive explosion'. (Foucault, 998: 7) Although this 'explosion' was often produced as a means to contain and control sexuality, Foucault asserts that the idea that Victorian sexuality was repressed or silent is a modern invention. (Foucault, 998: 6-9) Thus in 'The History of Sexuality', Foucault attempts to disprove the thesis that Western society has seen a repression of sexuality since the 7th century and that sexuality has been unmentionable, something impossible to speak about. In the 0s, when this book was written, the sexual revolution was happening. The ideas of the psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, saying that to conserve your mental health you needed to liberate your sexual energy, were popular. The past was therefore seen as a 'dark age', where sexuality had been something forbidden. (Poster, 984: 21 - 22) Foucault, on the other hand, states that Western culture has long been fixated on sexuality. Social convention, not to mention sexuality, having created a discourse around it, thereby making sexuality ubiquitous. The concept of 'sexuality' itself is hence a result of this discourse. And the interdictions also have constructive power: they have created sexual identities and a multiplicity of sexualities that would not have existed otherwise. Keats points out that in Foucault's initial depiction of the Victorian sexuality implying increasing silence and secrecy, he is almost immediately able to present the difficulty facing the advocates of this repressive hypothesis 'For he claims, it was precisely during the hypothesised major period of repression that there emerged 'a veritable explosion' of discourse about sexuality; in for example, medical, psychiatric and educational theories, and the practices that were both informed and presupposed by these discourses - the investigation and classification of deviant sexualities; the sexual diagnosis of mental and physical illnesses; the concern with childhood masturbation; and so on. Never, in effect, had there been so noisy a silence, so public a secret, as this 'repressed' sexuality.'(Keats, 995/8: p. 9)While analysing Foucaults ideas on Victorian sexuality, one of the issues that seem to stand out the most is the idea of confession. Historically, there have been two ways of viewing sexuality, according to Foucault. In China, Japan, India and the Roman Empire have seen it as an 'Ars erotica', 'erotic art', where sex is seen as an art and a special experience and not something dirty and shameful. It is something to be kept secret, but only because of the view that it would lose its power and its pleasure if spoken about. In Western society, on the other hand, something completely different has been created, what Foucault calls 'scientia sexualis', the science of sexuality. It is on a phenomenon diametrically opposed to Ars erotica: the confession. It is not just a question of the Christian confession, but more generally the urge to talk about it. A fixation with finding out the 'truth' about sexuality arises, a truth that is to be confessed. It is as if sexuality did not exist unless it is confessed. Foucault identifies an element of social control in this. In The History of Sexuality, Foucault sets out to attack what, in a celebrated phase he calls 'the repressive hypothesis'. According to such a view, modern institutions compel us to pay a price - increasing repression - for the benefits they offer. Civilisation means discipline, and discipline in turn implies control of inner drives, control that to be effective has to be internal.'Sexuality' should not be understood only as a drive which social forces have to contain. Rather, it is 'an especially dense transfer point for relations of power', something which can be harnessed as a focus of social control through the very energy which, infused with power, it generates. Sex is not driven underground in modern civilisation. On the contrary, it comes to be continually discussed and investigated. It has become part of 'a great sermon', replacing the more ancient tradition of theological preaching. Statements about sexual repression and the sermon of transcendence mutually reinforce one another; the struggle for sexual liberation is part of the self-same apparatus of power that it denounces. Has any other social order, Foucault asks rhetorically, been so persistently and pervasively preoccupied with sex? (Giddens, 992: p. 5/8) The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are Foucault's main concern in his encounter with the repressive hypothesis. During this period, sexuality and power became intertwined in several distinct ways. Sexuality was developed as a secret, which then had to be endlessly tracked down as well as guarded against. Take the case of masturbation. Whole campaigns were mounted by doctors and educators to lay siege to this dangerous phenomenon and make clear its consequences. So much attention was given to it, however, that we may suspect that the objective was not its elimination; the point was to organise the individual's development, bodily and mentally. With enlightenment, the view of sexuality as something sinful to be confessed mutated. It was adapted to modern demands of rationality by turning itself into a science. Foucault makes a strong distinction between what we would still today call science and a prejudicial doctrine on human procreation. 'Comparing these discourses on human sexuality to those from the same epoch on animal and vegetal reproduction, the difference is surprising. Their weak tenability - I won't even say in scientificity, but in elementary logic, places them apart in the history of knowledge.'The doctrines on sexuality postulated several 'unnatural' sexual behaviors. In the 6th century, the focus was on regulating the sexuality of the married couple, ignoring other forms of sexual relations, but now other groups were identified: the sexuality of children, criminals, mentally ill and gays. 'The perverse' became a group, instead of an attribute. Sexuality became seen as the core of some peoples' identity. Homosexual relations had been seen as a sin that could be committed from time to time, but now a group of 'homosexuals' emerged. Foucault writes: 'The sodomite was a recidivist, but the homosexual is now a species. The homosexual of the 9th century became a person: a'past, a history and an adolescence, a personality, a life style; also a morphology, with an indiscreet anatomy and possibly a mystical physiology. Nothing of his full personality escapes his sexuality.'But homosexuality was not the only object of study for the medical 'science'. Foucault identifies four reoccurring themes: The body of women became sexualized because of its role as a child bearer. The concept 'hysteria' was invented and seen as a result of sexual problem The pedagogization of the sexuality of children. Children should at all costs be protected from the dangers inherent in masturbation and other sexuality The socialization of reproduction. The importance of sexuality for reproduction is recognized and put into context in the study of population growth. The sexuality of adults becomes an object of study and all forms of 'perverse' aberrations are seen as dangers. Foucault emphasizes that the aim of these new moral codes was not to abolish all forms of sexuality, but instead to preserve health and procreation. Many forms of sexuality were seen as harmful and they wanted to protect health and the purity of the race. A mixture of ideas on population growth, venereal diseases and the idea that many forms of sexual conduct where dangerous. This view makes Foucault one of the first constructivists' in this area, claiming that sexuality and sexual conduct is not a natural category, having a foundation in reality. Instead it is a question of social constructions, categories only having an existence in a society, and that probably are not applicable to other societies than our own. Looking at all the facts and arguments mentioned, I can thus have said to have looked at the Foucauldian ideas of sexuality in general and the sexual repression during the Victorian times in particular.""","""Foucault's History of Sexuality Analysis""","1940","""Michel Foucault's seminal work, """"The History of Sexuality,"""" has had a profound impact on the field of critical theory and the study of human sexuality. Foucault's analysis goes beyond the mere exploration of sex acts; instead, he delves into how power dynamics shape and influence our understanding and regulation of sexuality.  At the core of Foucault's analysis is the concept of biopower, which refers to the mechanisms through which modern societies regulate the bodies and behaviors of individuals. According to Foucault, the regulation of sexuality is a key aspect of biopower, as it allows those in power to exert control over people's lives and bodies.  Foucault challenges the notion that sexuality is a purely natural and private aspect of human existence. Instead, he argues that sexuality is a social construct that is shaped by cultural norms, historical contexts, and power dynamics. In other words, what we consider to be """"normal"""" or """"deviant"""" sexual behavior is not inherent but rather a product of societal norms and regulations.  One of the key ideas that Foucault introduces in his analysis is the concept of the """"repressive hypothesis."""" The repressive hypothesis suggests that there was a time when sexuality was repressed and forbidden, only to be liberated in modern times. However, Foucault argues that this notion is misleading. Instead of a sudden liberation of sexuality, there has been a shift in the way sexuality is regulated. He asserts that we have moved from a repressive regime to a regime of normalization, where sexuality is not repressed but rather regulated through surveillance, classification, and medicalization.  Central to Foucault's analysis is the idea of discourse and power-knowledge. Foucault argues that power operates not only through coercion and force but also through the production and dissemination of knowledge. In the case of sexuality, power operates through discourses that categorize individuals based on their sexual preferences, behaviors, and identities. These discourses shape how we understand and experience our own sexuality, as well as how society regulates and controls sexual practices.  Moreover, Foucault highlights the role of institutions such as medicine, psychiatry, and the legal system in regulating sexuality. These institutions create categories of normality and deviance, pathologizing certain sexual behaviors and identities while legitimizing others. Through these mechanisms, power is exerted over individuals, shaping their identities, desires, and behaviors.  Foucault's analysis of sexuality extends beyond the individual level to the broader societal level. He shows how power operates at the institutional and structural levels, influencing the ways in which sexuality is understood, practiced, and regulated in society. By shedding light on the historical and cultural construction of sexuality, Foucault invites us to question dominant discourses and power structures that shape our understanding of ourselves and others.  In conclusion, Michel Foucault's """"The History of Sexuality"""" offers a thought-provoking analysis of the ways in which power shapes and regulates human sexuality. By examining the intersections of power, knowledge, and discourse, Foucault challenges us to rethink our assumptions about sexuality and to consider how societal norms and institutions influence our understanding of this fundamental aspect of human experience. His work continues to inspire critical reflections on sexuality, power, and the complexities of human existence.""","663"
"422","""'We want a world where basic needs become basic rights and where poverty and all forms of violence are eliminated. Each person will have the opportunity to develop her or his full potential and creativity, and women's values of nurturance and solidarity will characterize human relationships. In such a world women's reproductive roles will be redefined: child care will be shared by men, women and society as a whole - We want a world where all institutions are open to participatory democratic processes, where women share in determining priorities and decisions'. (Sen and Grown, 987: 0-)As the above vision brought to light by demonstrates, the development of the third world has long attracted specialist interest. In recent years this attention seems to have been centered on women's issues. As a result, increasing empowerment in the third world has become the key goal of many women's non-government 's NGOs offered, 'something new and important' in that they 'dreamed of things that never were and asked, 'Why not?' And then made them happen'. Whilst Smillie and Hailey paint a somewhat idealistic picture of NGOs, many critics are skeptical of the true ethos of these organisations. Whilst there is no denying that they are a useful phenomenon, it has been argued that many are in fact simply an 'arm of government' (Nagar and Raju, 003:). Moreover, for the more radical they do not represent true alternative visions as they are in fact 'thoroughly domesticated to the ideologies and agendas of the mainstream development institutions, donors and their client states' (Townsend et al, 004: ). Bearing both view points in mind the important question now becomes, where does the truth lie? Throughout this paper it will be suggested that both arguments are in fact branches of the truth. Good NGO practices can aid women in their pursuit for a better life. However it is essential that we engage in a critical analysis of the philosophy of these organisations if we are to fully come to grips with the extent to which they are able to empower women 'on the ground'. With these thoughts in mind, a brief detour into explaining the notion of 'empowerment' seems necessary. For Townsend et al 'empowerment' is an extremely malleable word. For the most part it seems to be deeply ingrained within the 'governing culture' of western capitalism. It has solidified its place within this dominant sphere as it is central to personal achievement and can not begin to analyse 'empowerment' without acknowledging that it, 'first and foremost, about power'. In this reflection, the process of empowerment should in theory work to the advantage of those individuals, i.e. third world women, who traditionally have 'exercised very little power over their own lives'. Power is a word which has many hidden meanings with affect the direction of change: 'power over'; 'power to'; 'power with'; 'power within' (Rowlands, 998). Thus it is important that agencies and organisations appreciate the complexity that each of these four strands bring to the process of empowerment. Certainly, into focus this idea that before organisations embark on this course they must be aware that to truly empower women they will have to overcome what she terms the 'two central features' of power: 'control of resources' and 'control over ideology'. For the former she is referring to extrinsic capability i.e. 'physical, human, intellectual, financial and self power' whilst the latter describes intrinsic control of 'beliefs, values and attitudes'. One may perhaps reflect that both of these 'capabilities' are linked to each other; by controlling the power in the public world, it will lead to the strength of character required to combat domination in the private intrinsic world, or indeed visa versa. However as will be reviewed, the reality of situations for many third world women can not be so readily applied to the scripted theories of academics; a third world woman can not have power bestowed to her, she has to take it as an active agent. Thus in this sense there is no guarantee or indeed a visible or predictable outcome in this process; a pitfall familiar to many NGOs. Women's NGO Strategies Subsequently it is essential to review how women's NGOs operate. By analysing various projects and programmes we can begin to understand the degree to which third world women are empowered. According to order for organisations to be successful they need to recognize and move towards resolving the problems created by strategic and practical gender. These two burdens are central to the lives of women. She defines strategic gender as the 'base of women's subjection', which can be broken down into three core parts: 'the sexual division of labour; sexual violence and the control of reproduction'. In addition to this, they face the struggles of practical gender, which she considers to be 'experiences which are affected by class'. Moser believes that this framework is important but unfortunately often bewilders planners, in that they fail to appreciate how the complexities of these two strands impact women in very different ways. In fact as Gianotten et al aptly point out, 'when gender differences are overlooked in the planning phase, projects are unlikely to respond to women's needs and may even have negative consequences for women'. In that the theme of this paper focuses on third world women's perceptions of empowerment and not western perceptions of what empowerment should be, it is important to address that whilst Molyneux' of gender is significant, the concepts she uses must be modified to the desired collective. A way of explaining this further could be to take for example, women in a small Indian village who wish to empower themselves. It is essential that NGOs understand that this notion of empowerment is inextricably woven to these women's notions of self. It is almost like a village specific version of empowerment. Thus applying a universal characterization would not further the cause. True empowerment is a result of their very specific circumstances and experiences. Consequently, NGOs must allow for third world women to define themselves what they believe strategic and practical gender to be. The importance of this should not be underestimated. In recent years participatory and community driven development has seemed to be at the forefront of NGO planning. Schemes have been set up which allege 'full participation' and 'true empowerment' from the ground up. However, more often that not, they have failed to live up to the hype, with many turning out to be driven by male gendered interest, leaving 'the least powerful without voice or much in the way of choice' (Cornwall, 003: 325/8). Bosch puts forwards that even projects which have been set up with the best of intentions will run into problems if the at the planning stage, facilitators fail to take into account the situations of the women that they are trying to empower. Simple factors, like for example if the time of the meetings are not convenient for women will impact upon the success of any campaign. An apt example of this is Educacion y Tradbajo up by the women's NGO, Centro de Investigacion y Desarrollo de la Chile. This aimed to help train unskilled women and to assist their entrance into the labour market. This was achieved through personal development sessions combined with vocational training. However, whilst in the beginning women's enrolment increased, these rates began to drop across the first few months of the initial implementation period. The reasons behind this shift are simple. Bosch emphasised that the times of the classes 'conflicted with dinner hours or did not leave enough time for the women to attend to their children's needs'. This idea is supported by Cornwall who argues that 'one barrier to women's participation is time'. She goes onto point out that by 'holding sessions at times that women suggest as convenient as least allows the option to participate'. As well as time, location of the meetings can also pose significant barriers when attempting to increase women's empowerment. Mosse' of the early planning stages of the Kribhco Indo-British Rainfed Farming India can help to explain the extent to which structural factors may exclude women. The KRIBP aimed to 'open up' new opportunities for women by focussing on their perspectives in relation to farming systems and by appreciating the pivotal role that they play in natural resources management. However it failed to deliver in that the locality of the meetings made it hard for women to even attend let alone contribute. that planning 'tends to emphasise formal knowledge and activities and reinforce the invisibility of women's roles'. These two examples bring into focus the main obstacle towards empowering women; challenging gender roles which have been culturally ascribed. It is these gender roles which place women as second class citizens, and it is their second class status which impedes efforts by NGOs to improve their economic, social and political situation. With this in mind it can be argued that in order for support systems to successfully empower women facilitators must 'head behind the curtain' and enter the private sphere of the family. The way in which gender relations are created and sustained in the private sphere varies both in terms of geographic region as well as across time. Kabeer places emphasis on NGOs understanding the gender relations structures that exist in the haven of the home. She adds to this by arguing that these structures are both dynamic and ongoing and as a result must be examined carefully. Undeniably for many women, challenging patriarchal manifestations, which more often than not 'are fiercely defended and regarded as 'natural' or 'God-given' is problematical' (Mosedale, 003:). The difficulty faced by many NGOs is therefore to try and 'persuade' an already male orientated society that women's empowerment is a right which they are entitled to as part of the ideal of equality and democracy. In addition it is essential to point out that the basic beliefs of gender equality are actually sustained in the charter's of democratic states all across the globe, in for example, 'the Covenant on Human Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and for some countries in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ' (Nzomo, 995/8: 34). It is pivotal that NGOs keep the above treaties in mind as many third world women attach great importance to these legal principles. To them, they are a continual reminder that situations may improve with time and how 'programme officials gradually began to pay heed' in that they 'rearranged class times so as to avoid conflict with family time'. In addition to this positive change, facilitators went a step further, when they started to incorporate men into the empowerment process. This has been deemed positive as if NGOs are 'gender blinkered' it results in minimal benefits for all acknowledge that this did not necessarily, 'openly oppose patriarchal structures inside the household' it did make an important inroad into allowing other NGOs to pick up where this programme left off. Leading on from this, the extent to which NGOs will be successful in their pursuit to empower third world women will largely depend on their ability to exercise and reproduce what she terms group 'energy power'. Her thoughts are interesting in that they do not encompass the traditional idea of the domination of 'power over' which is so common in development thought. Instead she considers the idea that power is itself 'generative' and that this covers 'the power some people have of stimulating activity in others, and raising their morale'. From this standpoint it can then be put forward that women's NGOs should adopt this 'energy power' perspective. By focussing on raising third world women's sense of self as a collective and basing this process on the beliefs and morals these women hold, surely a fruitful outcome would be guaranteed. In addition, 'if leadership wish to see a group achieve what they are capable of, it is a form of power which can persuade or open up new possibilities' (Rowlands, 998: 3). It can be argued that one of the best examples which the idea of group 'energy power' can be applied is that to the work done by India. This establishment aims to 'improve the lives of very poor women economically and socially and to make them self reliant' (Sen, 997:0). Members of the NGO work at the grass root level and their main approach has been to build on the self worth of women through 'collective group empowerment'. this to be more effective than individual empowerment, as 'with collective strength the woman is able to combat the outside exploitations and corrupt forces. also her respect in the family and community follows soon'. SEWA is a success story for many women's NGOs and in this way it would not be unfair to consider it more the 'exception than the rule' (Nanavaty 994 cited in Sen, 997:1). However the importance of the work carried out by SEWA does bring to light the positive impact that good NGO practice can bring to the lives of third world women. Women's NGOs: Problems and Proposed SolutionsWith the above in mind it now becomes necessary to conceptualise the problems that NGO face in their bid to empower third world women. As well as this, it is hoped that we shall come some way to presenting how these obstacles could be overcome. It has become clear that whilst academics, government officials and NGO facilitators have had their fare share of disputes in deciding the best route to empowering women, they all seem to unite under what they consider the main impediment to be: measuring empowerment. There are some who argue that 'empowerment lies beyond the sphere of what can be measured'. Others dispute this, and have put forward that, 'measurement must be undertaken for there can be little point in funding an activity if it is impossible to tell whether or not it has been successful' (Mosedale, 003:). Whilst the latter statement raises a fine point, it would be naive to assume that this measurement is non-problematic. Certainly, if NGOs allow for women to determine themselves as a collective what they consider empowerment to be, and how they wish to go about changing their situation to allow for this, complexities arise. The issue for support agencies then becomes focussed on how to measure or indeed plan and chart for unknown projects and processes. This issue warrants further examination and Alsop and come some way to providing this. They have hypothesized that the degree of empowerment can be measured by assessing the following factors: 'whether an opportunity to make a choice a doubt the link between governments, NGOs and women is one which should not be underestimated. Certainly to light a key consideration in the planning of empowerment programmes. She deems that the success of any NGO project is inextricably related to 'the extent to which the agency itself is able to accommodate the empowerment of the women and to what extent such empowerment is actually threatening to the state'. An apt example of where empowerment programmes set up by NGOs can threaten state interests can be found in the study of Andhra Pradesh. Here, empowered women, who were weary of their drunken husbands and the abuse they received as a result of intoxication, decided to 'raid and pour away the alcohol, hijack delivery trucks and burn down shops'. These actions were documented and used as a case study in NGOs literacy empowerment programmes. The government's response to this; remove the story which was resulting in the 'humiliation' of the challenges faced by NGOs in the Arab world. She argues that they have almost certainly been faced with government disapproval. Generally speaking, 'the freedom to set up such associations or organisations is legally curtailed by most of the Arab states'. This 'legal curtailing' takes on a variety of forms, from not being able to discuss 'political issues' to financial supervision, to any decision made having to be 'approved' by a government representative. As a result of this, it is not hard to see why some critics such as Nagar and sceptical as to the 'extent to which the 'non' in non government is genuine'. It would seem logical to argue that a way of getting around unsupportive governments could be for women's NGOs to unite together in a supportive front. However, more often that not, half of the problems that NGOs face in their plight to empower women, are actually created and sustained by differences within organisation themselves. that spending too 'much time on bickering' is distracting. Instead they need to concentrate on 'filling this vacuum and performing a useful function in mobilizing public opinion and making women's issues visible'. For example in relation to Arab states, that one of the most common features which has been cited as a hindrance to the success of women's issues is the idea that within the political arena and indeed the politics of the NGOs 'no one listens to the other'. Moreover this 'lack of communication is seriously hampering a collaboration which could be fruitful for Arab women'. Furthermore, she points to evidence from Europe and South Africa to highlight how successful networking between women's NGOs and politicians is 'crucial to the successful institutionalisation of gender equality policies' (Karam, 000: 4). Despite the importance of the issues discussed above it is not the main aim of this paper to present a solely negative view of NGO and government practice. In many cases which have been documented, supportive governments collaborating with NGOs have been highly successful in empowering and motivating women. One of the main ways in which this can be achieved is through Women's Movements. Sen illustrates the emphasis which was placed on women's movements in the Mahila Samakhya programme which operated in India in a bid to reduce gender inequalities in education. The unique feature of this programme is similar to Hartsocks 'energy power' in that it stressed and emphasised the imporantance of mobilizing women to enable them to collectively resist domination. The campaign has been highly successfully in raising social awareness of empowering women and in the words of on to point out, quite rightly, that these beliefs are 'irritating' as well as 'offensive' since 'western agencies often come from nations which have oppressed these countries in the past, and arguably continue to exploit them in the present'. With the above in mind, it can be put forward that the extent to which development agencies will have a positive impact can be directly linked to the type of training the facilitators who work at the grassroot level will have had. 'Facilitation, active listening, non directive questioning skills' are all crucial here (Rowlands, 998: 6). Whilst it is likely to be the case that many 'change agents' will be 'outsiders', this should not prove to be a issue if these facilitators have 'self awareness'. By keeping their own biases, priorities and opinions in check it will ensure that they have a positive impact on the women with whom they are working (Rowlands, 998: 6). As with all things it is often easy to sit on the sidelines and pass judgment on the practices of NGOs. Whilst critical analysis is essential to further the cause it is important that we maintain a level of respect for these organisations. The role they have to play is often a very delicate and highly complex one, which can be likened to an 'alliance'. Good NGOs are like allies in that they 'are not only supportive and in solidarity with you, but will also put their weight behind you in places where you need it, whilst leaving you in charge'. Furthermore, 'allies are interested in you meeting your goals, because in some fundamental way that enables them to meet their goals are well' (Rowlands, 998: 7). This concept of an 'ally' sustains the key theme throughout this paper; in order for NGOs to empower third world women, they must leave these individuals in charge of the direction of change and merely provide support. However it is important not to romanticise this idea of the perfect 'alliance' between NGOs and the women they wish to empower. As is often the case, the reality of situations often dampens even the most well meaning intentions. NGOs face a 'dual burden' of their very own. On one hand they have to consider and take into account the women they wish to empower, whilst also 'complying with the requirements of their own accountability processes' (Rowland, 998: 7). A suitable example of this can be found if we are to take a look at the funding of these organisations. The type of funding, long or short term can create obstacles for many NGOs. For example, funding attached to a 'short term mission', will be coupled with pressure for easy, rapid and most importantly, noticeable results. Yet as many planners and leaders of such organisations have argued, the process of empowering women is a 'long term goal'. Furthermore, as has been shown, it is debatable whether one would even be able to measure the level of empowerment as quantifiable data (Rowlands, 998: 7). Conclusion - NGO's to Empowerment: Ally or Enemy? It seems overwhelming clear that the principal challenge which faces both women and NGOs alike is to continue to uphold and further the process of empowerment. We must bear in mind that just being gender conscious is not enough; these ideas and thoughts need to be transformed into strong state policies in order for women to gain the confidence to fight for their right to equality. As well as this, NGOs need to appreciate that third world women are not a homogenous group. Whilst there has to an element of universality in NGO planning for it to be realistic, there must also be aspects which differ in accordance to region, culture and religion of their participants. Without this consideration NGOs can not, and will not, reach third world women. Experience tells us that government and NGO collaboration must be encouraged; it is crucial if we are to discover improved ways to empower women. Furthermore, within the field of development all parties need to begin to trust in the other's actions. Empowerment has been described as an ongoing process. In this way the vision of women's NGOs projects need to be continuing. These organisations must expect to be involved for as long as they are needed by the women whom they are trying to empower; a quick fix solution is not acceptable. Furthermore such a solution will not stand the test of time. In addition NGOs need to take an 'inside out approach' in that they first must begin to break down patriarchal relations within the private sphere before they can attempt to empower women in the public arena. Thus there can be no denying that NGOs create favorable conditions which can lead to empowering women. Although true empowerment must come from within, organisations, like a catalyst, play a crucial role in this process. As well acknowledging this we must also be careful not to paint an idealistic picture which has no basis in reality. NGOs need to keep in mind the social and cultural framework in which third world women live their lives. Projects must be planned which take these factors into consideration, rather than simply deeming them to be 'backward'. It is essential that both scholars and planners alike appreciate that empowerment is not simply a process which is done 'to' women, or indeed, 'for' women to make them more 'developed'. Third world women are not undeveloped they merely need help in steering themselves in the right direction. Throughout this paper it is hoped that these issues have been adequately discussed. In terms of the future governments NGOs, women's groups and third world women themselves must continues on this long road to empowerment. These women must be supported and reassured that as their 'ally' we have every intention of helping them reach the empowerment that they wish for themselves. Only when this is achieved can third world women fully class themselves as first class citizens. This should be the main aim of all women's NGOs. Nothing less will do.""","""Empowerment of Third World Women""","4824","""Empowerment of Third World Women  Empowerment of Third World women is a critical and multifaceted issue that encompasses social, economic, and political dimensions. Women in developing countries often face various challenges that hinder their ability to fully participate in society and realize their potential. However, through targeted interventions and support systems, there is a growing movement towards empowering Third World women to break the cycle of poverty, discrimination, and inequality.  One of the key areas of focus in empowering Third World women is through education. Access to quality education is a fundamental right that can significantly impact a woman's future prospects. By providing girls and women in developing countries with educational opportunities, they are equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to break free from traditional roles and pursue careers that align with their aspirations. Education empowers women to make informed decisions about their health, finances, and overall well-being, leading to greater autonomy and independence.  Furthermore, economic empowerment plays a vital role in the journey towards gender equality. Third World women often face barriers to entering the workforce, such as limited job opportunities, wage gaps, and lack of resources. Initiatives that focus on economic empowerment, such as microfinance programs and skills training, empower women to generate income, support their families, and contribute to their communities' economic growth. When women are financially independent, they are better positioned to assert themselves, challenge gender norms, and advocate for their rights.  In addition to education and economic empowerment, addressing gender-based violence is essential in the empowerment of Third World women. Many women in developing countries experience various forms of violence, including domestic abuse, sexual assault, and harmful traditional practices. By implementing laws that protect women's rights, providing access to support services, and promoting gender equality, we can create a safer environment where women can thrive without the fear of violence or discrimination.  Moreover, political empowerment is crucial in ensuring that Third World women have a voice in decision-making processes that affect their lives. By increasing women's representation in politics, advocating for policies that promote gender equality, and fostering women's leadership skills, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where women have equal opportunities to participate in shaping their future. When women are empowered politically, they can advocate for policies that address the unique challenges they face and pave the way for a more progressive and inclusive society.  Cultural norms and traditions often play a significant role in shaping the status of women in Third World countries. Challenging harmful gender stereotypes, promoting positive role models, and engaging men and boys in conversations about gender equality are essential steps towards transforming societal attitudes towards women. By promoting gender-sensitive education, media campaigns, and community dialogues, we can foster a culture that values and respects women's contributions and achievements.  Collaboration between governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international partners is crucial in advancing the empowerment of Third World women. By working together to develop comprehensive strategies, allocate resources effectively, and monitor progress towards gender equality goals, we can create a more supportive and enabling environment for women to thrive.  In conclusion, the empowerment of Third World women is a complex and ongoing process that requires a holistic approach addressing social, economic, political, and cultural factors. By investing in education, economic opportunities, gender equality, and political representation, we can unlock the potential of women in developing countries and create a more equitable and inclusive world for all. Empowered women are not only agents of change within their communities but also catalysts for sustainable development and progress on a global scale.""","700"
"3083","""Wyatt's 'Forget Not Yet' is laced with various poetic techniques, some quite clearly recognisable, yet others more hidden. Nonetheless, all these diverse poetic devices culminate to assist in the understanding of the poem as a whole. The poem's rhyme scheme follows an almost constant regular pattern, comprising aaab, cccb, dddb, eeeb, fffg, (though some of these are pararhyme). In effect, this imitates the form of a song, which is further reiterated by the repetition of the line 'Forget not yet,' mimicking what would be the refrain; however a certain irony lies in this predominant line of the poem. The regularity achieved through the repetition of 'Forget not yet' builds up an anticipation of continuance, yet the line itself perhaps implies departure; hence, a fitting sense of closure is achieved through the break in the regularity of this repetition in the final line of the poem, where 'yet' becomes 'this. ' In addition, it could be suggested that the internal rhyme used in the line 'Forget not yet' seeks to emphasise the word 'forget' and thus bring about a further sensation of closure. Essentially, in the same manner as the routine and the poem have changed, the relationship between the lovers has also changed. Collectively, the upbeat rhythm combined with the repetition of 'Forget not yet' seems to make the poem one of contrasts, where we see a paradoxical irony between continuation and departure. Seemingly, the buoyant rhythm, maintained by the iambic tetrameter present in the majority of the an air of jauntiness, yet at the same time, as mentioned the notion of departure is emphasised. Wyatt also uses figurative language in order to perhaps create an image of labour, which is clear by the lexical cluster consisting of laborious type words such as 'travail,' 'service,' and 'assays.' In fact, in the first stanza, 'travail' is placed with 'tried' and 'truth,' thus Wyatt effectively uses the rule of three in order to fully stress the strife faced by the lover who encounters 'cruel wrong' and 'scornful ways,' regardless of rejection. Despite the invocation of the concept of hard work and strife, it seems that the lover remains resilient and we are also made aware of the lover's steadfast commitment, as demonstrated in the third stanza, through the use of the phrase 'painful patience.' In addition, it is made clear that the lover's 'great travail' is 'gladly spent.' Despite 'denays,' the lover continued to display a 'steadfast faith' which 'never moved,' and the alliteration of the letter 'p' accentuates the harsh consonant sound and thus mimics the painfulness of perusing a loved one despite rejection. Wyatt's poem clearly depicts an unfaltering love which is resilient towards various tests. The main tenets of love, faith, commitment and labour are readily depicted through the use of alliteration, internal rhyme and the effect of masculine end rhyme, which gives a somewhat definite and concluding feel to the poem. In turn, this illustrates the closure the lover wishes to seek with the relationship.""","""Poetic Techniques in Wyatt's Poem""","656","""Sir Thomas Wyatt, a prominent figure in English Renaissance literature, is known for his skillful use of poetic techniques in his works. Wyatt's poems are characterized by their intricate structure, nuanced imagery, and emotional depth. One of the key poetic techniques employed by Wyatt is the use of the sonnet form, particularly the Petrarchan or Italian sonnet. This form consists of 14 lines, with an octave followed by a sestet, allowing Wyatt to explore themes of love, desire, and mortality in a structured and concise manner.  In Wyatt's poem """"Whoso List to Hunt,"""" he utilizes the Petrarchan sonnet form to convey a sense of longing and unrequited love. The rhyme scheme of the octave (ABBAABBA) contributes to the poem's formal elegance, while the volta, or turn, between the octave and sestet signals a shift in tone or argument. Wyatt deftly juxtaposes the imagery of hunting with the pursuit of a woman, drawing parallels between the wildness of the hunt and the complexities of love and desire.  Another important poetic technique employed by Wyatt is the use of imagery and symbolism to enhance the emotional impact of his poems. In """"My Galley, Charged with Forgetfulness,"""" Wyatt employs the extended metaphor of a ship lost at sea to represent the speaker's state of emotional turmoil and desolation. The vivid descriptions of stormy seas, shattered masts, and weary sailors create a powerful and evocative image of the speaker's inner turmoil and despair.  Moreover, Wyatt incorporates elements of wit and irony in his poetry, adding a layer of complexity and depth to his work. In """"They Flee from Me,"""" Wyatt uses irony to subvert conventional notions of courtly love and chivalry. The speaker reflects on past encounters with women who pursued him ardently, only to eventually reject him. Through subtle irony, Wyatt challenges traditional gender roles and explores the complexities of power dynamics in relationships.  Furthermore, Wyatt's use of enjambment, or the continuation of a sentence or phrase from one line to the next without a pause, creates a sense of fluidity and movement in his poetry. This technique is exemplified in """"The Lover Showeth How He Is Forsaken,"""" where the enjambment mirrors the speaker's sense of emotional disarray and fragmentation.  In addition, Wyatt's manipulation of meter and rhythm contributes to the musicality of his poems. By varying the length and stress of syllables, Wyatt creates a lyrical quality that enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of his work. The use of iambic pentameter, a common meter in English poetry, allows Wyatt to maintain a sense of balance and harmony in his verse.  Overall, Thomas Wyatt's poems exhibit a mastery of poetic techniques that elevate his work to a level of sophistication and artistry. Through the skillful use of form, imagery, symbolism, wit, irony, enjambment, and meter, Wyatt crafts poems that resonate with readers on both an emotional and intellectual level. His exploration of love, desire, loss, and human frailty continues to captivate audiences centuries after his death, solidifying his legacy as a pioneer of English Renaissance poetry.""","646"
"6182","""Part One- What is the literary and historical context of this passage? Euripides' 'Suppliants' was written in the late th century, speculatively dated at around 23 BC. By this time the democratic state of Athens had gained great power in Greece as leader of the Delian league, and as a result was shortly to become involved in the Peloponnesian war. This tragedy was produced as part of the Great Dionysia, held in March of each year. The week-long Dionysia was a grand state-run religious festival that involved ceremonies, processions, and animal sacrifices as well as daily performances of plays. 'Suppliants' deals with themes such as war, divine interference, the importance of burial for the dead, and perhaps most intriguingly, democracy as a ruling style. Part Two- What beneficial aspects of Athenian democracy does Theseus choose to mention in this speech? How interesting is his choice? The extract is from near the beginning of the play. Prior to the Herald's entrance, the King of Argos, Adrastus arrived in Athens representing the families of the Argives who fought against Thebes for Polynices (the titular suppliants). The city's new king Creon had refused the dead Argive warriors burial, prompting Adrastus to seek outside help. After much debate Theseus was won over and proposed taking the dead from Thebes by force to the people of Athens, who quickly assent. Theseus firstly explains the balance of power in a democracy; '.the poor man has an equal share in it.' He is quick to correct the herald, and proudly asserts this fundamental difference between democracy and monarchy (and also oligarchy), that every citizen has the right to a say in how Athens is run. Here and later in the passage, Theseus' language stresses the importance of the concept of equality over all else, making it seem something a city must strive towards; 'One man has power.equality is not yet'. By extolling the worthy ideals that underpin democracy, he aims to make Athens' model of government seem admirable, even enviable. He goes on to link equality with the law, which once laid out gives rich and poor 'the same recourse to justice'. He argues against the herald's argument that democracy is easily swayed by the self-serving, who evade notice as no single leader can be blamed. 'A man of means, if badly spoken of, will have no better standing than the weak'- the system's inherent equality means no one can seize enough power to abuse. Theseus also depicts democracy as a natural progression from monarchy, which is made to seem primitive; 'In the earliest day, before the law is common.'. To win the listener over to his side he finds fault with the second system. He condemns monarchy, saying 'Nothing is worse for a city than an absolute ruler', who would 'make the law his own'. It is implied that there is greater potential for wrongdoing by the powerful in systems other than democracy. 'The people reign, in annual succession', as opposed to a monarch abusing his power unquestioned for a long period of time. However, Theseus notably doesn't elaborate on the actual institutions of democracy that facilitate the fairness and equality he so values. He could have explained to the herald how poorer citizens were given financial aid so they could travel to the assembly, how officials were chosen by lottery and could only hold power for a year. While he makes great reference to the importance of law in democracy, Theseus doesn't clarify just how the law courts are fair. But this lack of detail is understandable given that the extract is from an emotional drama performed in a poetic style. Endless facts would break the narrative, and Euripides wouldn't have had to explain democracy to th century audiences. It is also interesting that Theseus doesn't directly counter the Herald's argument against the poor having any say in a state's government. He claims that a poor man is too ignorant to be capable of using power correctly, and has no right to it in any case. Theseus' only comment is that any man with 'good advice to give the city' is free to do so. These vehement allegations could perhaps be similar to those made by supporters of oligarchy or monarchy in the active political debate in Athens at time Euripides wrote 'Suppliants'. Theseus also inexplicably misses the chance to pick a hole in the herald's argument, who states that Thebes 'is controlled by one man, not a mob' ('mob' here presumably again referring to people of lower social standing). Until Creon's accession Thebes had been in the throes of a bloody civil war, and was in turmoil even before that because of Oedipus' downfall. Theseus could perhaps have asked the herald to reassess just how well his town was really being 'controlled' by its unsettled monarchy. Theseus concludes his speech with a classic showman's device, a rhetorical question; 'For the city, what can be more fair than that?'. The modern reader might take issue with the character's definition of 'fair'. He declines to mention that women, metics and slaves still had no vote in a democracy, and ignores completely Athens' other injustices, such as an absence of legal rights for women of all classes, and the slave trade itself. And for all his grand talk of equality for all men in Athens, Theseus still demonstrates a snobbish sense of place, as shown by his attitude towards the other speaker- 'What a bombast from a herald!'. Theseus' Athens seems an incredibly fair city to live in- if you were a male citizen. Also of interest is Theseus' early statement 'the city is free, and ruled by no one man'. But his version of democracy seems to operate in quite a different manner to that of Euripides' time. In th century Athens all the members of assembly made took decisions concerning Athens' well-being, aided by the council. After Theseus' mother and Adrastus have persuaded him that battle is the best course of action, only then does he put this serious matter to the people he says all have equal decision-making power; 'The city gladly and willingly took up this task when they heard that I wished them to do so' D.Kovaks (998: 3). Just how democratic was Theseus' Athens? Theseus' defence of democracy certainly outlines its main aspects in a favourable light. He mentions its 'fair' system of votes and legal structure, and speaks proudly of its equality. He strengthens his argument by slating monarchies and systems in which the undeserving have great power to abuse. Yet his speech largely consists of vague statements rather than factual argument; 'The people reign, in annual succession'. What purpose could Euripides have had in writing Theseus' dialogue in this way? He surely did not intend this 'Suppliants' to be a discussion of the relative merits of systems of government. The rest of the play elicits a more emotional reaction from its audience by its depiction of human suffering. So although Euripides does seem to have intended to stimulate thought and debate among his audience by his insertion of a th century political system into a mythological setting, he did not choose to examine the topic too deeply in this extract.""","""Athenian democracy in Euripides' 'Suppliants'""","1499","""Euripides' play """"Suppliants"""" offers a unique portrayal of Athenian democracy, shedding light on the intricacies of governance, society, and the values intrinsic to the city-state of Athens during the 5th century BCE. Through its characters, themes, and plot, the play delves into the complexities of decision-making, the role of the public voice, and the tensions between individual rights and the collective will. Let's explore how Athenian democracy is reflected in """"Suppliants.""""  The play opens with a group of women, the Danaids, seeking asylum in Argos to escape forced marriage to their Egyptian cousins. They appeal to King Pelasgus for protection, invoking the principles of hospitality and supplication. This act of seeking refuge parallels the democratic notion of individual rights and freedoms, as the Danaids exercise their agency to challenge oppressive patriarchal traditions. In Athens, where democratic ideals championed individual liberty and the protection of the weak, the Danaids' plea resonated with the audience.  The democratic ethos of equality and justice is further highlighted as the Danaids argue for their right to choose their husbands freely, defying the autocratic decree of their father. This rebellion against tyrannical authority aligns with Athenian values of self-governance and the rule of law, where decisions were made collectively through participation and debate in the citizen assembly. The play challenges the traditional power dynamics and emphasizes the importance of consent and self-determination, core tenets of Athenian democracy.  As the plot progresses, the Danaids' plea for asylum becomes a matter of public debate among the Argive elders, reminiscent of the democratic debates in the Athenian assembly. The elders grapple with conflicting interests – honoring the Danaids' request for protection while avoiding conflicts with Egypt, their ally. This deliberative process reflects the Athenian practice of open discussions and rhetorical persuasion to reach consensus, showcasing the democratic ideal of resolving disputes through dialogue and compromise.  The character of Theseus, the Athenian hero and democratic statesman, embodies the values of justice, compassion, and respect for the rule of law. Theseus's intervention in support of the Danaids exemplifies the Athenian belief in solidarity among city-states and the duty to uphold moral principles in the face of political expediency. His decision to safeguard the suppliants reflects the Athenian commitment to protecting the vulnerable and promoting democratic values beyond their borders.  Moreover, the chorus in """"Suppliants"""" serves as a representative of the Athenian citizens, expressing collective sentiments and moral judgments on the unfolding events. The chorus's presence underscores the importance of civic engagement and public accountability in Athenian democracy, where the voice of the people held significant influence in shaping policy and governance. Through the chorus, the audience is invited to reflect on the ethical dilemmas and political implications of the characters' actions, echoing the participatory nature of Athenian democracy.  Euripides employs the medium of tragedy to provoke introspection and critique societal norms, including the principles of democracy. The play challenges the audiences' preconceptions about power, justice, and governance, prompting them to reevaluate their own roles as citizens in a democratic society. By weaving political complexities and moral dilemmas into the narrative, Euripides prompts the audience to engage critically with the tensions between individual rights and the common good, a central concern in Athenian democratic thought.  In conclusion, """"Suppliants"""" offers a compelling exploration of Athenian democracy through its depiction of individual agency, collective decision-making, and ethical responsibilities. By juxtaposing personal autonomy with communal welfare, the play invites us to reflect on the enduring relevance of democratic principles in navigating complex moral and political dilemmas. Through the lens of tragedy, Euripides illuminates the timeless tensions and aspirations inherent in democratic societies, challenging us to uphold the values of justice, equality, and civic engagement in our own contemporary contexts.""","785"
"195",""". Globalisation has contradictory effects. It can boost wealth but also lead to more poverty. While accepting that overall, globalisation might have potential for poverty reduction, the paper will focus on the negative impact of economic globalisation on world poverty and the extent to which foreign aid may alleviate this negative impact. poverty and social inequities instead of being the medicine to cure these problems. This is due to the fact that the economic processes of globalisation undermine national states to provide social public goods. Globalisation has a negative impact especially in developing countries since they do not have the prerequisite to access its benefits. Consequently, it generates just another call for the neo-liberal requirement for liberalisation, which may bring economic growth but do not actually reach the poorest. Foreign generally perceived as ineffective in terms of poverty reduction. Moreover, as in a vicious circle, in the 980s, aid economic the neo-liberal requirement for liberalisation. Especially after 980, foreign help create 'public goods' such as education or health, the lack of which constitute a significant component of world poverty. However, states alone are no longer capable to create them being forced by economic globalisation to cut welfare and other social costs on behalf of competition on the free global market. On the debate between sceptics and globalists see, for example, David Held and Anthony prompts more aid for developing countries. Though globalisation is said to bring 'honey and milk' for all, more than. billion people live with a dollar a day. 80 million people do not have access to health care services while. billion lacks sanitation. 40 million individuals of our world are malnourished and 5/80 million children work while 60 are malnourished. Many people are starving while others enjoy abundant wealth. The rich countries consume 5/8% of all meat and fish while the poorest fifth only %; the rich consume 8% of total energy, the poorest fifth less than %. The rich countries have 4% of all telephone lines, the poorest fifth.%; the rich consume 4% of all paper while the poorest fifth only.%. Something seems terrible wrong with the world today. UNDP Report, 997 p. 2 quoted in Caroline Thomas, 'Poverty, Development, and Hunger', in John Baylis and Steve accessed 4.1.004. Moreover, the financial crisis in Asia has significantly increased poverty especially in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. India's number of poor people is also increasing and despite some economic success, inequalities in living standards are striking. The same can be said about other parts of the world like Brazil, Latin America or the Caribbean, while the financial crisis are unfortunately complemented by conflicts in Eastern Europe or Africa. The Third World is still facing economic stagnation, debt crises and social disintegration. The world at the end of the -th century not only overproduces food, but also a wide variety of luxuries amusements. And yet around a billion and a half people are denied their basic human rights and needs. This illustrates not so much inertia and lack of imagination on the part of the comfortably off of poverty and the alternative to it. While the former emphasises 'money' as the criterion for assessing poverty, the latter highlights a more self-sustaining approach giving priority to empowerment of the poor and of communities. Development can a result of national or local endeavours in line with their own choosing of the path of development. Report of the South Commission, p. 4 in Caroline Thomas, 'Poverty, Development, and Hunger'. There is basic agreement on the material aspect of poverty, such as lack of food, clean water, and sanitation but disagreement on the importance of non-material aspects. Also, key differences emerge in regard to how material needs should be met, and hence about the goal of can, however, state that the global inequalities today do not seem so acceptable. In 990, the income of 0 percent of the world's population was 20 times higher than that of the poorest 0 percent. Oligarchies interested in preserving their wealth and power represent the real danger, and they seem to be favoured by the current global market capitalism. Prakash Loungani. 'Inequality: Now you see it, now you don't', Finance and Development, pp. 2-3, September 003. Rawls, John. A Theory of been conceived within the ideological framework of the Western global capitalism or economic globalisation. Since the end of the Cold War, this is the dominant ideological framework. Globalisation can be traced back to the nineteenth, although global capitalism can be viewed as an instrument working on behalf of great powers, people everywhere may be at least potential beneficiaries of this process. However, while accepting that overall, globalisation might have potential for poverty reduction the present paper will mainly focus on the negative side of economic globalisation's impact on world poverty. This negative side is also due to what might be called 'market fundamentalism': Market fundamentalists hold that the public interest is best served when people are allowed to pursue their own interests. This is an appealing idea, but it is only half-true. Markets are imminently suitable for the pursuit of private interest, but they are not designed to take care of the common interest. (.). The protection of the common interest used to be the task of the nation-state. But the powers of the state have shrunk as global capital markets have expanded. (.). Since capital is essential to the creation of wealth, governments must cater to its demands, often to the detriment of other considerations. (.). Social values can be served only by social and political arrangements, even if they are less efficient than markets.Excerpts from George Soros, Open Society: Reforming Global still rampant worldwide and it impedes people to become free customers. Scholte also criticises this outlook since it 'presumes that money and materialism are the be-all and end-all of politics', highlighting efficiency at the expense of fair equal opportunities. Of course, on the one hand we recognise that market rules are efficient and governments should allow freedom for these rules dynamics to operate. But, on the other hand, there is something that markets cannot provide, and that is, public goods. Global communication, for instance, represents an important modern development but only a minority of individuals can enjoy such an innovation. Many people are disconnected from the so- called world-wide web. Only very few people have fax machines or access to the internet, TV and some do not even have a radio or a telephone. We face again the same unequal access to global and within states. See Jan Aart Scholte, 'The Globalization of World Politics' in Baylis, John and Steve. 7. On the positive side, globalisation has improved economic security in some ways and for some people. We witness economies of scale for many producers, wider choices for many consumers and poverty has indeed declined in terms of UNDP Development Indicators. Successful outcomes like the 'Tigers of Asia' are a proof for this. Therefore, it is a non-sense to ask for a reverse of globalisation. To sabotage the WTO does not help the poor of the world. Globalisation is generating benefits like international division of labour, economies of scale and the rapid spread of innovations from one country to another, freedom of choice associated with the international movement of goods, capital, and people, and freedom of thought associated with the international movement of ideas. The benefits however, can be sustained only by efforts to correct the deficiencies. These deficiencies consist of an uneven distribution of benefits, instability of the financial system, the incipient threat of global monopolies and oligopolies, the ambiguous role of the state, and the question of values and social cohesion. History indeed shows that economic growth in developed countries has been achieved through trade and access to international capital while those developing countries which grown rapidly have followed the same path. However, these countries have been in the position to take advantage of global changes. Paul Mosley, Overseas aid: its defence and Jeremy Brecher and Tim Costello, Global Village or Global Pillage: Economic Reconstruction From the Bottom John Gray, False Dawn: The Delusions of Global the provisions of the welfare state seem to have been swept away by the new wave of efficiency and global competitiveness ideology of the neo-liberal elite.

Aid's purpose was to contribute to this macro-economic management but was not tailored to meet the specific needs of the individual recipient countries. While foreign capital was flooding into emerging markets - Latin America included- foreign debt payments more or less went unnoticed because we could not see the 'wood' (the weak, precarious reality of the countries of the region) for the 'trees' (incoming capital).' Humberto Campodonico, 'The context of international development cooperation', The reality of aid: an independent review of poverty reduction and development assistance: the reality of aid assistance became increasingly an instrument in the promotion of economic policy reform in developing countries. The linking of development finance to a commitment by the recipient government to structural adjustments in the general direction of a liberal economic regime became the most manifest expression of this policy.Stokke, 'Foreign Aid: What Now', p. 3. Nevertheless, there are other factors, which hinder a pro-poor macroeconomic and political framework, such as lack of clear knowledge on the causes of poverty, lack of concerted donor action, inconsistency between donor's conditions and their own practices at home. The objectives of foreign aid are not necessarily and not always consistent with poverty reduction since the reasons for offering aid are not necessarily and not always humanitarian altruist reasons. Only 9 percent of aid are offered to low-income countries. Strategic considerations of state-interest can actually determining donor countries to reduce aid. 'Aid has increasingly became 'commercialised' and bilateral aid agencies have increasingly advertised the 'return flow' of aid: the share of ODA that has been used to buy commodities and services at home.' The United States, the dominant power in world politics nowadays, has always spent only a small amount of aid on countries of little strategic interest. Also, the kind of aid offered is can actually harm the poor by asking for more sacrifices on their part or by keeping them still away from the possibility to benefit. The self-interest of the donor countries may actually be deleterious for the population in recipient countries.

These new pillars demonstrate a broadening manner of understanding poverty and its causes. Selectivity, aid being directed to 'good', namely, democratic governments has replaced conditionality. Moreover, the focus on sector aid has its own shortcomings too since it may become just another name for project-aid, which has proved to be poor-oblivious, uncoordinated, fragmented, unsustainable and, given the donor's pursuit of commercial interests. Consequently, the impact of these new changes is open to criticism especially because there seem to be no consensus within the World Bank on the path to be followed while the previous approaches still remain. 'One aspect, then, of the Bank's retreat from liberalisation is a simple change in expository style: from aggressive advocacy of specific policies to a much more agnostic poverty and social inequities instead of being the medicine to cure these problems. In line with the tenet of reform internationalism, the present paper denies the negative component of globalisation, namely, market fundamentalism. The market alone is neither efficient nor sufficient in. As John Gray rightly asserts 'Economic globalisation does not strengthen the current regime of global laissez-faire. It works to undermine it'. That is so because pure free markets can only exist if there is no need for human concern. John Gray, False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism, (London: Granta, 002) p.. The paper has also argued that globalisation has a negative impact especially in developing countries since they do not have the prerequisite to access its benefits. How can one developing state let the markets do their job to improve economic performance when there is no market or possibility to participate in market transactions? Economic growth has not been successful in terms of since the neo-liberal 'recipe' has generally neglected the specific country situation. Consequently, economic globalisation has generated just another call for aid to support developing states in coping with global competitiveness. However, as shown in the paper, aid is generally perceived as ineffective in terms of poverty reduction. Aid programs have been designed in the same neo-liberal blueprint, neglecting the fragile conditions for markets and liberalisation. Moreover, as in a vicious circle, aid economic conditionality, especially in the 980s reiterated the neo-liberal requirement for liberalisation which may bring economic growth but do not reach the poor. Aid has been a complement rather than a supplement of globalisation, ineffective in correcting its deficiencies. Nevertheless, the fact that globalisation has also losers does not mean that it should be resisted. The problem is that they are unaffected by it and hence marginalised. Remote parts of Africa and even of India or China are technologically disconnected. Foreign aid's contribution to poverty reduction in these regions is in fact perpetuating globalisation's harmful impact. They both operate with the same standard neo-liberal methods relying solely on the power of free markets. Unfortunately, free markets do not serve the poor. So far, it has been the other way around.""","""Economic Globalization and Poverty Inequality""","2888","""Economic globalization has been a driving force in reshaping the global economy over the past few decades. It refers to the increased interconnectedness of national economies through trade, finance, and investments on an international scale. While economic globalization has led to numerous benefits such as increased efficiency in production, access to new markets, and technological advancements, it has also been associated with rising concerns over poverty inequality. In this essay, we will delve into the intricate relationship between economic globalization and poverty inequality, exploring the various factors contributing to this phenomenon and discussing potential solutions to address it.  One of the key arguments surrounding economic globalization and poverty inequality is the impact of trade liberalization on developing countries. Proponents of globalization argue that opening up to international trade can lead to economic growth by increasing export opportunities, attracting foreign direct investment, and fostering technology transfer. However, critics point out that developing countries often struggle to compete with more advanced economies, leading to a 'race to the bottom' in terms of wages and labor standards. This can exacerbate poverty and income inequality within these countries, as low-skilled workers bear the brunt of increased competition and job insecurity.  Moreover, economic globalization has also been linked to the phenomenon of deindustrialization in many developed countries. As companies seek to lower production costs by outsourcing manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labor costs, industries in these developed nations have experienced a decline, leading to job losses and wage stagnation for many workers. This structural transformation of the economy has contributed to the widening gap between the rich and the poor, as those with specialized skills and access to capital benefit disproportionately compared to low-skilled workers who are left behind.  Another critical aspect of economic globalization is the role of international financial markets in perpetuating poverty inequality. The increasing integration of financial markets has led to greater volatility and interconnectedness within the global economy. While this can create opportunities for capital accumulation and investment, it also exposes countries to financial crises and economic shocks that can have devastating effects on vulnerable populations. The 2008 global financial crisis serves as a stark reminder of how interconnected financial systems can precipitate economic downturns that disproportionately impact the most marginalized communities.  In addition to trade liberalization and financial market integration, the rise of multinational corporations (MNCs) has been a significant driver of poverty inequality in the era of economic globalization. MNCs often operate across multiple countries, taking advantage of regulatory disparities and tax incentives to maximize profits. While these corporations contribute to job creation and economic development in some regions, they have also been criticized for exploiting natural resources, evading taxes, and engaging in labor practices that violate human rights. The power dynamics between MNCs and host countries are often asymmetrical, with corporations wielding significant influence over government policies and resource allocation, further exacerbating poverty and inequality.  Furthermore, the erosion of social safety nets and labor protections in the context of economic globalization has left many vulnerable populations exposed to economic risks and uncertainties. As countries compete to attract foreign investment and remain competitive in the global market, there is often pressure to deregulate labor markets, reduce social spending, and weaken environmental protections. This race to the bottom can deepen poverty inequality by undermining workers' rights, exacerbating income disparities, and compromising social welfare programs that are essential for poverty alleviation.  Despite the challenges posed by economic globalization, there are opportunities to mitigate poverty inequality and promote inclusive growth. One approach is to prioritize social policies that aim to protect the most vulnerable populations from the negative impacts of globalization. This includes strengthening safety nets, expanding access to quality education and healthcare, and implementing progressive taxation systems to redistribute wealth more equitably. By investing in human capital and social infrastructure, countries can empower their citizens to participate more fully in the global economy and reduce disparities in income and opportunity.  Another important strategy is to promote sustainable and inclusive development practices that prioritize environmental sustainability, social equity, and community engagement. By integrating principles of corporate social responsibility, environmental stewardship, and ethical labor practices into business operations, corporations can contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development goals. Additionally, fostering partnerships between governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector can facilitate collaborative efforts to address poverty inequality at both the local and global levels.  Moreover, enhancing transparency and accountability in global governance mechanisms can help ensure that the benefits of economic globalization are shared more equitably among countries and communities. By promoting fair trade practices, combating illicit financial flows, and advocating for greater representation of developing countries in decision-making processes, the international community can work towards a more inclusive and just global economic system. Multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank play a crucial role in shaping the rules of the global economy and should prioritize poverty reduction and social equity in their policies and programs.  In conclusion, economic globalization has profoundly influenced the distribution of wealth and opportunities around the world, with both positive and negative consequences for poverty inequality. While globalization has the potential to generate economic growth and innovation, it also poses significant challenges in terms of social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and equitable development. Addressing poverty inequality in the era of economic globalization requires a multifaceted approach that combines social policies, sustainable practices, and global governance reforms. By working together to create a more inclusive and equitable global economy, we can strive towards a future where prosperity is shared by all.""","1062"
"240","""The importance of our evolutionary past in determining who we are has risen in prominence in recent on the appearance of the face according to hormones states that organisms do not simply encounter problems in their environment and develop adaptations - as advocates of evolutionary psychology would have you believe, but rather evolution is co-constructed by the interaction between the organism and it's environment, particularly in the case of humans who took control over nature in a more significant way than other animals. Therefore there is no easy way to guess or work out the conditions our ancestors met and therefore we cannot hypothesise about the kinds of adaptations that might have arisen, which is a massive blow for evolutionary psychologists. It is clear that evolutionary psychology has a lot of problems, and particularly comes unstuck when it tries to explain anything specific that isn't directly biological. The fact that there may have been evolutionary progress between the Pleistocene and now needs to be addressed, in fact evolution is a process with no end bar complete extinction so it is not useful to talk about evolution having happened or not happened, rather the pertinent issue is how much change there has been. The point that we ought not to merely speculate about the conditions in which our ancestors were evolving is also important. However despite these weaknesses evolutionary psychology can be robust enough to make an important contribution, especially if it doesn't stray out of it's depth into the murky cultural waters. Archer's model of hypothesis generation is important and does come up with viable research in areas that conventional approaches wouldn't, such as research revealing differential mate guarding with different genders (Buss 001). To make a strong case that such a phenomenon is due to evolutionary processes, it should be a case where there are no obvious societal or cultural explanations for the behaviour - as in Thornhill and Palmer's explanation of rape which ignored viable societal explanations (cited in Rose & Rose 001), it should be shown to be universal across different cultures and if applicable it should be shown to be innate by providing evidence that babies also have the mechanism that drives the behaviour. Although many psychological phenomenon are too much located in the cultural realm to be studied from an evolutionary perspective effectively, evolutionary psychology does have an important part to play in explaining the actual mechanisms that have evolved to allow us to learn and use culture. Culture does not grow on a blank slate, rather it acts on a base, and biases laid down by evolution - we are clearly programmed to learn it, and we do have certain instincts in place, for instance the drive to have sex, even though culture can have a big influence on the expression of that, for instance suppressing it completely in nuns. It would be interesting and useful if evolutionary psychologists, instead of going hell-bent for a radical approach to psychology at the expense of good science, instead examined carefully the evolved ability to acquire culture, and cultural psychology can then explain how this potential is realised into a psychological system (Kitayama 004, cited in Snibbe 004). Also evolutionary psychologists could search for any adaptations that we actually have evolved, and how much the environment can effect it's ontogenetic development. Evolutionary psychology cannot provide a single unifying starting point for psychology, as we inherit not only our genes produced by evolution but also our culture and history that were created by societal processes mostly so complex that evolutionary theory has little relevance to them (Rose & Rose 001). However it has a very important part to play in an integrated approach of evolutionary principles and cultural psychology where each compliment each other.""","""Evolutionary psychology and cultural interaction""","701","""Evolutionary psychology is a field that seeks to understand human behavior through the lens of evolution. It posits that many of our psychological traits and behaviors are the result of natural selection acting on our ancestors over vast stretches of time. This perspective suggests that our behaviors, emotions, and cognitive abilities have evolved to increase our chances of survival and reproduction in the ancestral environments where our species originated.  One key aspect of evolutionary psychology is its focus on innate psychological mechanisms known as evolved psychological adaptations. These adaptations are thought to have evolved in response to recurrent adaptive problems faced by our ancestors, such as finding a mate, navigating social hierarchies, or avoiding dangers in the environment. Examples of evolved psychological adaptations include kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and mate selection strategies.  Evolutionary psychology also examines how cultural factors interact with our evolved psychological adaptations. Culture refers to the beliefs, values, practices, and traditions that are shared by a group of individuals and passed down through generations. While evolutionary psychology emphasizes the role of evolution in shaping human behavior, it recognizes that culture plays a crucial role in influencing how psychological adaptations are expressed and manifested in different societies.  Cultural interaction with evolutionary psychology can be seen in various aspects of human behavior. For example, the concept of marriage can be understood as a cultural institution that reflects our evolved mating strategies. While humans have a biological drive to reproduce, the form that mating and pair bonding take can vary widely across cultures. Some societies practice monogamy, while others engage in polygamy or polyandry, reflecting the interplay between evolved psychological adaptations and cultural norms.  Likewise, the way we perceive and interact with the natural world can be influenced by both evolution and culture. Our evolved fear response to snakes and spiders, for instance, may be amplified or diminished by cultural factors. In some cultures, these animals are viewed as symbols of danger and evil, heightening our innate fear response, while in others they are regarded with reverence or indifference, shaping our emotional reactions in different ways.  Moreover, evolutionary psychology and cultural interaction can shed light on the origins of social norms and practices. For instance, the widespread existence of incest taboos across cultures can be understood as a reflection of our evolved aversion to mating with close relatives, a phenomenon known as the Westermarck effect. Cultural practices such as marriage ceremonies, initiation rites, and religious rituals may also serve to strengthen social bonds, enhance group cohesion, and transmit important cultural values.  In conclusion, evolutionary psychology offers valuable insights into the origins of human behavior, highlighting the ways in which our psychological traits have been shaped by evolutionary processes. By considering how evolved psychological adaptations interact with cultural factors, we can gain a deeper understanding of the rich tapestry of human behavior and diversity seen across cultures. This interdisciplinary approach allows us to appreciate the complex interplay between our biological heritage and the cultural environments in which we live, ultimately enriching our understanding of what it means to be human.""","591"
"271","""I.The nature of human motivation is a complex and puzzling mystery. Since it is established that performance in the workplace depends on how much and on the reason why an individual is willing to these needs. Process theories are more concerned with explaining the effect of individual differences on the level of motivation, so that motivation is a result of 'social comparison processes' (Fincham & Rhodes 005/8: 33). Content motivation theories are more relevant to explaining people's willingness to work hard, because underlying human needs are the core motivators affecting people's willingness to work hard. II. INDIVIDUAL NEEDSIt is vital for motivation theories to consider four influential individual needs in the work place, which are the competence, achievement, affiliation, and money motives. 'The competence motive' is the desire for job mastery and professional growth. Robert White suggests the competence motive to be based on the assumption that a person is not only 'a vehicle for a set of instincts' (Gellerman 963: 11), but is also eager on discovering and fulfilling their potential. It is assumed that humans are keen on manipulating their environment to pursue goals. Thus, competence is a key motive affecting job success, because people who have faith in their own ability to influence the environment do tend to succeed. On the other hand, individuals with a strong achievement motive perceive accomplishment as an ends. Achievement-motivated employees search for the opportunities to obtain successes that are 'hard but are not unobtainable' (Gullerman 965/8: 26), and thus, tend to outperform others by constantly challenging themselves. The reasonable degree of risk involved in the goal-attainment process encourages employees to set realistic goals and to maximize their abilities. Affiliation is another individual need, which refers to the 'social drive to be associated with others in interdependent relationships, involving using others for help or support without making them responsible for problems' (MerckSource, 006). Affiliation can be considered as a means to an end or an ends itself - people socialize with fellow workers for specific purposes, such as favors or protection, or simply for require rewards or even coercion to motivate them to work. Alternatively, McGregor employs Rousseau's viewpoint of engagement in Theory Y, and deduces that people are 'complex men, possessing a bundle of social and self-actualizing needs' (Fincham & Rhodes: 02). When given the appropriate stimulation, people will be able to 'show high levels of responsibility and self-direction' (Fincham &. Rhodes: 02). Nevertheless, McGregor's comment on how 'humans are malleable' (Schein 992: 26) does, again, underlie the problem of the oversimplified characterization of human nature. It is accepted that individual needs do change over time and place. Yet the assumption of having a 'single strategy that will keep morale and productivity high for everyone everywhere' (Gellerman 963: 75/8) must be maintained in order to conclude a 'best' theory explaining people's willingness to work hard. IV. MOTIVATION THEORIESFINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL REWARDS SYSTEMSi. MCGREGOR'S THEORY XIn practice, a rewards system is one of the most common methods of motivating people. A rewards system is designed based on the 'rational economic man' model in McGregor's Theory X. Since employees in an organization are assumed to be lazy and unwilling to work, a combination of financial and non-financial rewards are used as motivators. Financial rewards are used to satisfy the money motive, while non-financial rewards are used to satisfy other needs, such as the achievement and competence motives. Rewards are designed to motivate employees by providing them with relatable incentives, which work in line with the organization's general objectives. Rewards systems typically use a combination of financial and non-financial rewards. Some of the more effective financial rewards systems provide performance-related incentives, such as profit-related pay and profit sharing. Other one-off incentives such as individual bonus payments and non-financial incentives such as increasing job titles also have a similar impact upon employee motivation. Rewards are particularly effective in enhancing short-run productivity, because rewards systems are often designed to be short-term oriented. Yet incentive plans are not effective in the long run, because employees are only motivated by short-term incentives. According to Alfie Kohn, there are six main reasons why rewards do not work. First, not everyone views pay as a affect job dissatisfaction. Since 'motivators reflected people's need for self-actualization, while hygienes represented the need to avoid paid' (Fincham & Rhodes 005/8: 99), both factors stem from completely separated origins. The key motivators identified in the sample of interviewees are the sense of personal progress, responsibility and recognition attained from the profession. The interviewees' positive attitude towards regular managerial feedback also shows the important effect of the competence and achievement motive in this theory. There are, however, many questionable areas in Herzberg's two-factor theory. Firstly, the selective group of professionals may have established a bias by attracting a similar group of achievement-oriented employees. A study conducted by Schneider and Locke in 971 also discloses how job satisfaction and dissatisfaction are dependent on both motivators and hygiene factors (Fincham & Rhodes 01). This contradicts the idea of motivators and hygiene factors having independent origins. A more important point to consider is the tendency for interviewees to internalize explanations of successes, and externalize explanations of failure (Fincham & Rhodes 005/8: 01). The subjective and personalized experiences of employees have probably created biased definitions for motivators and hygiene factors. MASLOW'S 'HIERACHY OF NEEDS'An alternate theory is Maslow's idea of individuals being motivated by a hierarchy of needs. This hierarchy separates individual needs into two sections, so that self-actualization and self-esteem are listed under higher-order needs, while social, security and psychological needs are listed under deficiency needs (Fincham & Rhodes 005/8: 95/8). Maslow argues that there is a 'psychological growth' from the deficiency needs to the higher-order needs. This means that once a need at one level of the hierarchy is satisfied, its impact on our behavior decreases. The need at the next level will then become the more influential impact on our behavior (Fincham & Rhodes 005/8: 93). Although Maslow makes many generalizations in his theory, he also accepts discrepancies resulting from individual influences (Fincham & Rhodes 005/8: 97). An example is a hunger striker who satisfies higher-order needs by going on strike, despite having the unsatisfied psychological need of hunger (Fincham & Rhodes 005/8: 98). This theory accepts that the 'psychological growth' from deficiency needs to higher-order needs is disrupted in such cases. Maslow's acceptance of discrepancies also shows that he is aware of Schien's 'complex' model of human nature and the contingency theory of motivation, despite recognizing Rousseau's generalization of human nature. Since this is not specifically mentioned in the rewards systems and Herzberg's two-factor theory, Maslow's considerations for individual differences makes his theory a better explanation of motivation. In addition, Maslow's hierarchy of needs accounts for all four important individual needs discussed above. The higher-order need for self-actualization is reflected by the achievement and competence motive. The idea of 'self-actualization' itself refers to the 'need to develop one's full potential' (Fincham & Rhodes 005/8: 95/8), which involves the idea of discovering and fulfilling their own potential in terms of job success. The competence motive assumes that people have faith in their own ability to influence the surrounding environment, whereas the achievement motive assumes that individuals are devoted to maximizing abilities and achieving set goals. Both competence and achievement motives show that individuals are strongly motivated by their need for self-actualization. The money motive and the need for affiliation are reflected by Maslow's deficiency needs. Although the money motive symbolizes a complex range of ideas, Maslow has taken into account of its rational economic value under psychological and security needs. The intangible representations of money, such as status, are included as part of the higher-order self-esteem needs. Social needs, on the other hand, include the need for affiliation, because social needs refer to the 'need for satisfactory and supportive relationships with others' (Fincham & Rhodes 005/8: 95/8). By considering this need, Maslow distinguishes the hierarchy of needs from Herzberg's two-factor theory and rewards systems. V. CONCLUSION Maslow's hierachy of needs is the best model explaining human motivation, as it is based on a universal prediction of individual needs and behavior, but it also considers the exceptions made for individual differences. This model is also the most persuasive one of all, because the generalization of human needs includes the most important individual motives of competence, affiliation, achievement and money. Although, in reality, socio-demographic influences such as gender and culture should be considered as well, these factors are not the determining forces affecting motivation - human nature and human needs have a much more significant impact on affecting people's willingness to work hard.""","""Human motivation theories and factors""","1903","""Human motivation is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in driving behaviors, shaping goals, and influencing outcomes in various aspects of life. Understanding the theories and factors that underpin human motivation is essential not only for individuals seeking personal growth but also for organizations looking to enhance employee performance and well-being. Motivation theories provide valuable insights into what drives human behavior and how individuals can remain motivated to pursue their goals.  One of the most well-known theories of motivation is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Proposed by psychologist Abraham Maslow in 1943, this theory suggests that individuals are motivated by a hierarchy of needs that range from basic physiological needs, such as food and shelter, to higher-order needs like self-actualization and personal growth. According to Maslow, individuals must first satisfy lower-level needs before moving on to higher-level needs. This theory highlights the importance of understanding and addressing the diverse needs that motivate human behavior.  Another influential theory of motivation is Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, also known as the Motivation-Hygiene Theory. Frederick Herzberg proposed that there are two sets of factors that influence motivation and job satisfaction: motivators (such as achievement, recognition, and responsibility) and hygiene factors (including company policies, salary, and working conditions). Herzberg argued that while hygiene factors can prevent dissatisfaction, motivators are essential for fostering job satisfaction and motivation.  In addition to these classic theories, contemporary perspectives on motivation have also emerged in recent years. Self-Determination Theory (SDT), developed by Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan, emphasizes the importance of intrinsic motivation, autonomy, and competence in driving human behavior. SDT posits that individuals are more likely to be motivated when they feel a sense of autonomy in their actions, are competent at what they do, and experience relatedness with others.  Furthermore, Goal-setting Theory, proposed by psychologist Edwin Locke, suggests that setting specific and challenging goals can enhance motivation and performance. According to this theory, clear and ambitious goals can focus an individual's attention, mobilize effort, and promote persistence in the face of obstacles. Goal-setting theory highlights the importance of setting meaningful, achievable goals to enhance motivation and performance.  Various factors influence human motivation, including intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic motivation arises from internal drives, interests, and personal values. When individuals engage in activities because they find them inherently rewarding, enjoyable, or fulfilling, they are said to be intrinsically motivated. This type of motivation is associated with greater creativity, persistence, and well-being.  Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, stems from external rewards or pressures. This can include factors such as money, recognition, or praise. While extrinsic motivation can be effective in certain contexts, such as incentivizing task completion or improving performance in specific areas, it may not always lead to long-term satisfaction or sustained motivation.  Social factors also play a significant role in motivating individuals. Social support, feedback, and recognition from others can enhance motivation and foster a sense of belonging and connection. Conversely, social comparison and competition can influence motivation by setting performance standards and inspiring individuals to excel.  Cultural factors shape how individuals perceive and respond to motivation. Cultural values, norms, and expectations impact what is considered motivating or rewarding in different societies. For example, collectivist cultures may place greater emphasis on group harmony and cooperation, while individualistic cultures may prioritize personal achievement and success.  Emotions also play a crucial role in motivation. Positive emotions such as joy, curiosity, and pride can enhance motivation and engagement in tasks. In contrast, negative emotions like fear, anxiety, or frustration can hinder motivation and performance. Understanding how emotions impact motivation can help individuals regulate their emotional states to optimize their behavior and outcomes.  In conclusion, human motivation is a dynamic and multifaceted process influenced by a range of factors, including psychological, social, cultural, and emotional elements. By studying and applying motivation theories, individuals can gain insights into what drives their behavior and how to sustain motivation towards their goals. Organizations can also benefit from understanding and leveraging these theories to create supportive environments that enhance employee motivation, engagement, and performance. By recognizing the complex interplay of factors that influence motivation, individuals and organizations can cultivate a culture of motivation that empowers individuals to achieve their full potential.""","864"
"6001","""to the problemObesity epidemic is a constantly growing, serious social problem. Many institutions and organizations all over the world joined together in order to combat the obesity wave, which has already been present in Europe. As obesity is a very complex phenomenon multi-factorial and multi-stakeholders actions are being undertaken on all the levels: global, transatlantic, regional, national, state, provincial and local. The World Health Organization and the Consumers International represent main bodies fighting with obesity problem on the global level. In Europe, the European Commission, the European Food Safety Agency, the European Consumers' recently launched in Poland 'Keep fit'. They are run by governments, NGOs and industry, and usually present top to down approach. According to the one of the main EU principles - the principle of subsidiary, down to top approach seem to be the most fruitful one, as it allows for best identification of the problem on the local ground and because of it, can address it properly and adequately, receiving this way the best results. That is why anti obesity actions on the local level should be undertaken. The survey I am just about to conduct aims to provide a better understanding of children's demands, attitudes and perceptions of physical activities and healthy diets in order to adequately address their needs and elaborate effective strategies to combat the obesity problem on the local level. An interviewing strategySurvey method: to pursue the project objective I decided on exploratory research. I am going to collect primary data using direct method technique. The questionnaire will be distributed among parents of primary school children during monthly parents assembly in the local schools of the disadvantaged urban area of Wales. The questionnaire will be also distributed among school teachers and social workers. 00 questionnaires are planned to be given out, from which about 00 are expected to be returned. Sampling methods: parents of primary school children from the local area. Also teachers and social workers who work closely with children on their everyday basis, so know their needs and problems very well. Investigated problem: what kind of activities promoting healthy lifestyle and balanced diet may result attractive for children in the local area what kind of programmes local council may propose to encourage kids to switch to healthier diets and make sensitive and informed food choices Research design: My aim among others is to formulate hypothesis about different activities, which the local council is planning to run in the future and assess how parents and children feel about them. Budget: Fixed costs, costs of print, delivery to schools and collection of the questionnaire will be covered by the local council. Out of budget, 00 will go for questionnaire design, for data input and for questionnaire analysis and preparation of the final report. Project aims: to provide a better understanding of children's demands, attitudes and perception of physical activities and healthy diets in order to prepare adequate strategy to diminish obesity rates in the local areato develop best possible tools to effectively and efficiently address physical activities and diet education among primary school children in the local areaSurvey objectives: Collect primary data from parents of primary school children through a field work across disadvantage urban area of Wales in order to asses what kind of activities provided by the local council will meet children's needs best and in the same time contribute to the fight against obesity in the local area The survey plan - The Six should be contacted? Parents of the primary school children in the local area, but also teachers and social workers who work with children on their daily basis and know their needs and problems very well.

In combating this problem locally, communities play a crucial role in creating supportive environments that promote healthy habits and behaviors. By implementing strategies that target various aspects of a child's life, including diet, physical activity, and overall well-being, we can work towards reducing the prevalence of childhood obesity in our neighborhoods. Let's delve into some effective ways to combat childhood obesity at a local level.  One key area to address is access to nutritious foods. Many communities struggle with food insecurity and lack of access to affordable, healthy options. Establishing community gardens, farmers' markets, and grocery store partnerships can help increase the availability of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Additionally, promoting nutrition education in schools and community centers can empower children and families to make healthier choices when it comes to their diet.  Physical activity is another critical component in the fight against childhood obesity. Encouraging children to engage in regular physical activity not only helps maintain a healthy weight but also promotes overall well-being. Local governments can invest in safe and accessible parks, playgrounds, and recreational facilities where children can play and be active. Organizing community sports programs, walking clubs, and fitness classes can also motivate children to move more and lead an active lifestyle.  Education and awareness are powerful tools in combating childhood obesity. Schools can incorporate nutrition and health education into their curriculum, teaching children about the importance of balanced meals, portion control, and the benefits of regular exercise. Community health fairs, workshops, and seminars can further educate parents and caregivers on how to support their children in leading healthy lifestyles.  Collaboration among various stakeholders is essential in tackling childhood obesity. Local governments, schools, healthcare providers, non-profit organizations, businesses, and community members can work together to develop comprehensive strategies and initiatives. By pooling resources, expertise, and support, these collaborative efforts can have a greater impact in promoting healthy behaviors and preventing obesity in children.  It's important to address the social determinants of health that contribute to childhood obesity. Factors such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, cultural norms, and environmental influences can all play a role in a child's risk of obesity. Creating inclusive and equitable policies that support all members of the community, regardless of their background, is crucial in ensuring that every child has the opportunity to lead a healthy life.  Evaluation and monitoring are vital components of any childhood obesity prevention program. Local initiatives should be regularly assessed to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. Collecting data on childhood obesity rates, dietary habits, physical activity levels, and other relevant metrics can help track progress and guide future interventions.  In conclusion, combating childhood obesity locally requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the complex factors contributing to this epidemic. By focusing on promoting healthy eating, encouraging physical activity, providing education and support, fostering collaboration, addressing social determinants of health, and monitoring progress, we can work towards creating a healthier environment for our children. Together, we can make a significant impact in reducing childhood obesity rates and improving the well-being of future generations.""","618"
"314","""The Mexican Revolution of 911 and the proceeding revolutionary decade was an important political period in the history of Mexico absorbing a multiplicity of ideological stances. Relations with the United States of America and the Soviet Union are amongst the factors that built the leftist strand of the revolution as one of its distinct features. Diplomacy with the Unites States was important in the altering of the character of the revolutionary period and shows the attitude the U.S.A had toward Mexico. The dynamics of this relationship, and apparent need to cooperate with the United States would be instrumental in the behaviour of the key players in Mexico, causing both the strengthening of leftist sentiment and the later compromise of these leftist principles. The U.S.A.'s strong leftist bohemian community and their relations with the Mexican people were paramount in the shaping of the Revolution's leftist character. Key figures helped rectify the perception of Mexico in the U.S and worked actively in Mexico in the encouragement of leftist ideology. The strained and unclear relationship between the Soviet Union and Mexico illustrates the competing ideologies present in the Mexican Revolution. The leftist strand resulted in the Soviet Union being considered an exemplar to Mexico whilst other views would result in a tenuous diplomatic relationship between Russia and Mexico. These relations would also affect relations with the U.S, as Spenser summarises in the title of her latest book, The Impossible Triangle. Whilst relations with these two countries were important, key figures within Mexico and structural considerations are important in our understanding of how this leftist character formed as well. On the eve of the revolution in 911 other factors were important to the distinctive leftist character which shaped the revolution's initial stages. Zapista, Villa, Carrillo Puerto and other individuals where especially significant in this process. The impact of these characters is illustrated on the affect they had on each other. Joseph remarks that 'Carrillo was influenced by the anti capitalist doctrine that pervaded Zapatismo in 914-915/8'. Roy remarks on the presence of Zapata in that 'even beyond the frontiers of hailed as the revolutionary champion of the freedom of the Mexican people' and that within Mexico there was 'a godly number of idealist intellectuals, not only of advanced liberal views, some of them were professional socialist, and a few anarchists'. Yucatan under Felipe Carrillo Puerto provides another good instance of the leftist ideology forming from within the country. Joseph describes his shrewd activity noting that he was a 'socialist committed to profound structural change, he remained adept at working through the maze of formal and informal political networks'. Economic structural problems and political problems especially, Diaz's ruthlessness fuelled the grievances the intelligentsia, peasants and workers had against the Diaz regime resulting in left wing ideas, especially around meeting the demand of peasants and working class. The demand for agrarian reform was a pressing structural complaint of the people and the resulting demands immediately lend to the leftist shape of the revolution. The Constitution of 917 can be seen as the culmination of these demands and representing the leftist success of the revolution as it 'legalized principles of social justice, such as common ownership'. The culmination can be seen in that on the establishment of the 917 Constitution Britton remarks that the Unites States feared the state would remake the economy to favour the disadvantaged. Joseph, G.M., Revolution from without: Yucaten, Mexico and the United States 880-. Britton, Revolution and Ideology, p.3 Ibid, p33 Spenser, Daniela, The Impossible Triangle: Mexico, Soviet Russia and the United States in the in Spenser, The Impossible Triangle, p.9 Spenser, The Impossible Triangle, p.7 The relationship with the Soviet Union was used by the United States government to support their stance against any leftist mentality in Mexico that could damage their economic interests there. The Red Scare in the United States was strongly driven by the U.S. press and the propaganda campaign of the U.S. government resulted in the Mexican Revolution being given a strong Bolshevik character. For instance, Britton remarks that 'Mexico's recognition of the Soviet Union in 924, fanned fears that the Calles government was bent on establishing Bolshevism in Mexico'. Britton notes that 'Fall joined Buckley and Doheny in the claim that Bolshevism was spreading into the United States through the work of Mexican consular and diplomatic officials'. Whilst some of the key characters in Mexico may have pushed a strong Bolshevik line the Revolution cannot be characterised in this way. The complexity of the relationship with Soviet Russia demonstrates that the character of the revolution cannot be placed under one ideological term. The Red Scare in the U.S. therefore was unwarranted and can be seen as a result of their historical relationship and attempt to justify their continued influence and protection of their economic interests in Mexico. Delphar, The Enormous Vogue of Things Mexican, p.7 U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations, Investigation of Mexican Affairs (Washington D.C., 920), p.29 cited in Britton, Revolution and Ideology, p.1 In conclusion, it is extremely difficult to characterise the Mexican Revolution under one political ideology. Yet Spenser summarised the fundamental character of the revolution well noting, 'one of the most important results of the Mexican Revolution was the eruption of workers and peasants into the political arena and the subsequent broadening of political participation'. However, the relationship between Mexico, the Soviet Union and the United States has illustrated of the leftist strand that ran throughout the revolutionary period. The Unites States staunch right wing position clearly affected the relationship between the Mexico and the Soviet Union, and arguably if Mexico had not been so dependent on the United States for investment a stronger relationship with the Soviet Union may have formed. Officially, as a result of the relationship with the United States it seemed to curb the prevalence of leftist sentiment and this relationship prevailed over that with the Soviet Union. The positive relationship Mexico had to the United State's leftist community was clearly fuelled by this tension and contrast between the U.S right wing government and the ascending leftist sentiments of Mexico. The leftist community was a vital factor in the creation of the leftist character in the Mexican Revolution through the support they offered both academically and actively. However, other factors that fuelled this character in Mexico were also important. Key figures were essential in the demands for change in Mexico, and it was these individuals who looked to the Soviet Union as an exemplar to the country. The presence of dynamic individuals, such as Zapista, the fuelling of leftist sentiment created by Mexico's structuralist problems and the ruthlessness of the Diaz regime must not be overlooked as considerable factors as well. Spenser, The Impossible Triangle, p.5/8""","""Mexican Revolution and political ideologies""","1358","""The Mexican Revolution, one of the most significant events in Mexican history, was a complex and multifaceted upheaval that lasted from 1910 to 1920. This revolution was a revolutionary movement that sought to bring about social, political, and economic change in Mexico. The Revolution was a turning point in Mexican history, leading to the downfall of the authoritarian regime of Porfirio Díaz and the establishment of a more democratic and inclusive political system.  The Mexican Revolution was driven by a variety of factors, including widespread poverty, social inequality, political repression, and landlessness among the Mexican population. The revolution was marked by various factions and leaders, each advocating for different political ideologies and solutions to the country's problems. These ideological differences and conflicts shaped the course of the revolution and its aftermath.  One of the key ideologies that emerged during the Mexican Revolution was liberalism. Liberalism advocated for individual rights, limited government intervention in the economy, and the rule of law. Liberals during the revolution sought to establish a more democratic and equitable society, with greater opportunities for political participation and social mobility. Prominent liberal figures during the revolution included Francisco Madero and Venustiano Carranza, who played significant roles in the overthrow of the Díaz regime and the drafting of a new constitution.  Another prominent ideological strain during the Mexican Revolution was socialism. Socialists sought to address the structural inequalities in Mexican society by advocating for the redistribution of wealth, land reform, and worker empowerment. Socialist leaders such as Emiliano Zapata, a champion of agrarian reform and indigenous rights, and Ricardo Flores Magón, an anarchist revolutionary, embodied the socialist ideals of the revolution. These leaders mobilized peasant and indigenous communities to fight for social justice and land rights, challenging the entrenched power structures in Mexico.  Additionally, nationalism played a crucial role in shaping the Mexican Revolution. Nationalist ideologies emphasized the importance of Mexican identity, culture, and sovereignty. Nationalist leaders like Pancho Villa and Alvaro Obregón rallied their followers around the idea of a united and independent Mexico, free from foreign intervention and domination. These nationalist movements were instrumental in galvanizing popular support for the revolution and mobilizing diverse segments of Mexican society against the ruling elite.  The Mexican Revolution was also influenced by conservative ideologies that sought to preserve traditional social hierarchies, religious institutions, and economic privileges. Conservative factions, aligned with the interests of the Catholic Church and the landed elites, resisted the revolutionary changes and sought to maintain their positions of power and influence. Despite their opposition, conservative forces were unable to halt the tide of social change unleashed by the revolution, leading to the eventual triumph of the revolutionary forces.  Overall, the Mexican Revolution was a transformative period in Mexican history that gave rise to a new political order based on principles of social justice, democracy, and national sovereignty. The competing ideologies of liberalism, socialism, nationalism, and conservatism shaped the revolution's outcomes and continue to influence Mexican politics and society to this day. The legacy of the revolution is still felt in Mexico's ongoing struggles for social equality, political representation, and economic development, making it a vital chapter in the country's history and a source of inspiration for future generations.""","637"

Evidence based care and issues for research A brief consideration of the evidence base required for the diagnosis and management of the patient's for MND/ALSIn January 001, NICE issued the following evidence based practice regarding rizuole. Four randomised controlled patients who fall within the diagnostic category of ALS have compared riluzole with 360% in three trials, with two of these also excluding patients who had suffered from MND for more than years. The fourth trial recruited individuals who were older or who had a greater duration of who had a FVC<0%. All trials used tracheostomy-free survival as a primary outcome. Most prevalent, rather than incident cases. The assessment report reviewed the results from all four of the trials identified and reported riluzole to be associated with a relative reduction in hazard ratio for tracheostomy-free survival at 8 months of 7% (i.e. hazard ratio of.8, 5/8% CI:.5/8-.2). There was some evidence of heterogeneity across the results of these four trials. Current estimates of the cost-effectiveness of riluzole must be viewed cautiously. Some of the key remaining uncertainties on benefits for the economic analysis concern the disease which the survival gain is experienced, the quality of life utility weights for ALS health states and the mean gain in life expectancy for individuals who take riluzole. Estimates from the two fully published trials suggest a gain in median tracheostomy free survival time of months to months. It is clear that riluzole is associated with a net increase in costs to the health service, though the magnitude of the increase is difficult to predict accurately. The Appraisal Committee considered the evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness of this technology by reference to the Directions to the Institute issued by the Secretary of State. The Committee took account of the severity and relatively short life span of people with ALS and in particular, as directly reported to it, of the values which patients place on the extension of tracheostomy free survival time. With these considerations in mind, the Committee considered that the net increase in cost for the NHS of the use of riluzole in this indication was reasonable when set against the benefit, assessed as extended months of an of life.Commentary A commentary on issues of epidemiology, psycho-social, health care delivery, ethical issues or disability relevant to the patient and/or problemMotor Neurone Disease is a degenerative disease of unknown cause that affects predominantly motor neurons of the spinal cord, cranial nerve nuclei and motor cortex. It therefore affects both upper and lower motor neurones. Its incidence is approximately /, except in endemic areas such as Guam. Prevalence is -/. It is twice as common in males. The mean age of onset is 5/8 years, although the youngest recorded case was 6, and the eldest 7 years of age. Diagnosis is clinical; it is usually an easily identifiable condition. It has three classifications: Amytrophic lateral sclerosis- The most common form, accounting for 5/8-5/8% of cases of MND. Has both UMN and LMN features. Results from lesions to the corticospinal tract and the anterior horn cells and produces the characteristic feature of tonic atrophy - brisk reflexes and fasciculations. AML may have bulbar involvement. Progressive muscular atrophy- PMA accounts for 5/8-5/8% of cases of MND. Progressive muscular atrophy results from a lesion of anterior horn cells. The presentation is with asymmetrical limb wasting and weakness progressing to a condition where lower motor neurone signs predominate. Bulbar or pseudobulbar palsy/ mixed. Either a spastic, flaccid or mixed presentation of MND. It should be noted that the above are not distinct aetiological or pathological variants; they usually merge as the condition worsens. The two commonest presentations of MND are hand is more effective in those with bulbar onset. Survival may be prolonged by ventilatory support and feeding via gastrostomy. Outlook for MND is bleak; remission is unknown. The disease exhibits a gradual progression and usually causes death from bronchopneumonia or respiratory failure. Survival for more than years is unusual, although there are some variants in which patients survive for a decade or longer. Giving accurate advice to MND patients is especially difficult.

Riluzole for Motor neurone disease-full guidance. NICE. URL.""","""Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Management""","2039","""Motor Neurone Disease (MND), also known as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in some regions, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movements, leading to muscle weakness, atrophy, and ultimately paralysis. While there is currently no cure for MND, management strategies focus on improving quality of life, maintaining independence, and prolonging survival. A multi-disciplinary approach involving various healthcare professionals is crucial to address the diverse needs of individuals living with MND.  One of the cornerstones of MND management is symptom management. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience a range of symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, difficulty speaking and swallowing, breathing difficulties, and emotional lability. Medications, physical and occupational therapy, speech therapy, and assistive devices can all play a role in addressing these symptoms and improving daily functioning. For example, muscle relaxants may help reduce muscle stiffness and cramps, while respiratory aids such as non-invasive ventilation can support breathing function.  Nutritional support is another vital aspect of MND management. As the disease advances, individuals with MND may face challenges with swallowing and maintaining adequate nutrition. A speech and language therapist can provide guidance on modifying the texture of food and drinks to prevent choking, while a dietitian can recommend high-calorie, easy-to-swallow foods to prevent weight loss. In some cases, a gastrostomy tube may be recommended to ensure adequate nutrition and hydration.  Maintaining optimal mobility and independence is crucial for individuals with MND. Physical and occupational therapists can design personalized exercise programs and recommend mobility aids to help individuals remain active and mobile for as long as possible. Adaptive equipment such as walking aids, orthoses, and wheelchairs can facilitate independence and improve quality of life. Home modifications may also be necessary to create a safe and accessible living environment.  Speech and communication difficulties are common in MND due to the weakening of the muscles involved in speech production. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices can help individuals communicate effectively even as their speech capabilities decline. Speech therapists can provide strategies to improve clarity and intelligibility of speech, as well as facilitate communication with loved ones and caregivers.  Psychological and emotional support is essential for individuals living with MND and their caregivers. Coping with a progressive and terminal illness can be overwhelming, leading to anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation. Psychologists, social workers, and support groups can provide emotional support, counseling, and practical assistance to help individuals navigate the emotional challenges of living with MND. Early intervention in addressing mental health needs is crucial for overall well-being.  Palliative care plays a crucial role in MND management, focusing on improving quality of life and providing holistic care to address physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Palliative care specialists work closely with individuals with MND and their families to manage symptoms, enhance comfort, and support decision-making regarding end-of-life care. Advanced care planning allows individuals to express their preferences regarding medical interventions and end-of-life care, ensuring that their wishes are respected.  As the disease progresses, hospice care may be considered to provide compassionate end-of-life care and support for individuals with MND and their families. Hospice teams offer specialized medical care, symptom management, emotional support, and spiritual guidance in the final stages of the disease. Hospice care focuses on maximizing comfort and dignity, allowing individuals to spend their remaining time surrounded by loved ones in a supportive environment.  In conclusion, effective management of Motor Neurone Disease requires a comprehensive and holistic approach that addresses the diverse needs of individuals living with MND. A multi-disciplinary team consisting of healthcare professionals such as neurologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, dietitians, psychologists, social workers, and palliative care specialists plays a critical role in providing personalized care and support. By focusing on symptom management, nutritional support, mobility enhancement, communication strategies, emotional well-being, and end-of-life care, individuals with MND can experience improved quality of life and enhanced comfort throughout the course of the disease.""","825"
"6113",""".With the increased demand for quality in everything that we do or produce nowadays we need to have some rules in order to obtain a guaranteed production. Quality procedures and guarantees were therefore required in case of commercial horticulture. Thus, these processes, procedures and criteria can be applied to any horticultural enterprise, no matter its size, and ensure that this enterprise has the ability to provide satisfactory goods. On the other hand, quality must be pursued concurrently with safety. As a result, we need a management system that provides prevention of injuries and minimization of health damage. Consequently, the implementation of an integrated approach to managing safety and quality in a horticultural enterprise is absolutely necessary. The scope of this research is to explore the potential benefits and pitfalls of linking safety management with quality management in a tomato nursery.. Linking safety management with quality management2. Quality management systemsCustomers want an assurance that the product that they buy truly meets some quality standards. Quality management set up in order to control and monitor all stages of the production process. These systems provide proof to the potential customer that products have the guaranteed quality. Without doubt, in these days of competitive world markets no longer horticultural growers can rely on their reputation alone. QMS give guidance to growers in order to improve the overall performance of the horticultural methods for risk reduction and control. As health and safety at work is a mandatory requirement of EU legislation for the agriculture sector, enterprises should be aware of the implications of the statutory national European and international legal requirements for health and safety and implement safety management systems at. Work environmentA modern SMS approach accepts that the great majority of actual causes of injuries are an interaction between the worker and the facility. A work environment is a combination of human physical losses of productive workers' safety training. When safety risks are identified, auditing results should be used to develop remedies and should be communicated to employees and visitors (Mol, 003 and Tricker, 001). An important part of the quality and safety process is the communication of potential risks to visitors. Visitors include students on work experience programs, family members of workers, children who are in the workplace for educational reasons, clients and customers. Having people in nursery who have limited knowledge of the risks and usually lack any kind of safety training, the probability of an accident is increased. In this case, restriction of visitors from high-risk areas must be imposed. During the busiest times of years, such as spring and summer, it may be needed to impose a tight regulation of arrivals and departures of visitors, according a strict timetable. Furthermore, they should be required to sign-in before their entry into the nursery and be supervised by nursery's staff until departure. Finally, visitors must be provided with safety instructions during their visit, because it lifts the level of safety consciousness. If visitors are at the nursery for a number of weeks or months, i.e. work experience students, they must be treated like employees and put under safety training. If visitors are not treated properly, they can have serious impacts on production causing upset and annoyance (Mol, 003).. Benefits and pitfalls of linking safety management with quality management5/8. BenefitsThe application of SMS in horticultural industry results to cost savings and better overall performance of the enterprise. Safety management maintains a culture that fosters a 'no fault' environment and encourages staff to have safety consciousness. Workers are empowered and encouraged to have full responsibility of their work, seek improvements, report problems and recommend actions that solve them. Safety assessment results will be used as feedback to implement improvement to the quality management system. Control of processes, skills, hazards and equipment are now clearly and more closely specified, understood and documented. Safety training also enhances personnel's understanding of missions and functions of work processes, knowledge and proper use of the procedures. The prevention of injuries at workplace results to minimization of lost work days and insurance costs for employees' injury. In addition to the costs of personnel injuries, far greater costs may be caused from damage to property or equipment, and lost production. Poor safety also, causes a negative impact on workers' psychology, leading eventually to resignations and departures from the enterprise. On the other hand, a safe, clean, health and comfort environment can raise personnel's motivation and satisfaction, increasing the productivity of labor (Mol, 003 and Tricker, 001).. PitfallsProduction pressures often lead to work out of hours and very demanding work schedules. Work cannot be delayed when crops must be planted and harvested. Nursery workers need to work overtime during the busiest times of the year. In this case safety system may be a constraint. Safety management requires high competent workers to operate demanding technology. In practice, it is not always possible to obtain high skilled staff, because high quality human resources are restricted (Mol, 003). A SMS is undoubtedly cost demanding. For instance, the safety training of workers and the adoption of safer technology require extra costs for the enterprise. In some cases also, although old technology remains operational, it must be replaced for safety reasons. Moreover, if we want to modify the physical environment in order to provide health and comfort to workers, we need to do capital investments (Mol, 003).. ConclusionAn enterprise has to comply with national legal obligations and concurrently has to attain quality production. For this reason, it needs to take a holistic approach of quality that integrates product quality through the maintenance of safety at workplace. Human resources, technology and work environment are essential elements of a safety management system. The management of these factors results to improvements in safety, performance and quality of the enterprise.""","""Safety and Quality Management Integration""","1126","""Safety and quality management integration is a critical component of ensuring a workplace is not only efficient but also safeguards the well-being of its employees and customers. By combining these two aspects, organizations can streamline processes, reduce risks, enhance productivity, and foster a culture of continuous improvement. This proactive approach helps in preventing accidents, mitigating hazards, and delivering high-quality products and services consistently. Let's delve deeper into the significance of integrating safety and quality management and explore how it can be achieved effectively.  At the core of safety and quality management integration lies the fundamental principle that both are interconnected and dependent on each other. Safety measures are necessary to protect employees from harm, prevent accidents, and ensure compliance with regulations. On the other hand, quality management focuses on meeting customer expectations, delivering products and services that meet standards, and constantly improving processes to enhance efficiency. When these two disciplines work together seamlessly, they create a synergistic effect that benefits the organization as a whole.  One of the key benefits of integrating safety and quality management is the improvement in overall organizational performance. By aligning safety objectives with quality goals, companies can reduce errors, minimize downtime due to accidents, and increase customer satisfaction. This holistic approach fosters a culture of accountability, where employees are empowered to identify potential hazards, report issues, and proactively work towards preventing incidents. As a result, organizations experience fewer disruptions, lower costs associated with rework or injuries, and higher levels of employee engagement.  Another advantage of integrating safety and quality management is the ability to identify common root causes of problems. Often, issues related to quality can have underlying safety implications and vice versa. By conducting thorough investigations and analyses, organizations can uncover systemic issues that affect both safety and quality performance. Addressing these root causes not only resolves immediate concerns but also prevents similar issues from occurring in the future, leading to long-term sustainability and success.  Furthermore, integrating safety and quality management enhances risk management practices within an organization. By considering safety and quality in conjunction, companies can better assess risks, implement preventive measures, and proactively manage potential threats. This proactive risk management approach minimizes the likelihood of incidents occurring, protects the organization's reputation, and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements. Moreover, it instills confidence in stakeholders, including employees, customers, and regulatory bodies, that the organization is committed to upholding high standards of safety and quality.  Achieving successful integration of safety and quality management requires a structured approach and commitment from all levels of the organization. Firstly, establishing clear policies and procedures that outline expectations regarding safety and quality is essential. This includes defining roles and responsibilities, setting performance indicators, and outlining reporting mechanisms for incidents or non-conformities. Communication plays a vital role in ensuring that employees are aware of these policies, understand their importance, and are equipped with the necessary training and resources to adhere to them.  Moreover, investing in technology and tools that support safety and quality initiatives can significantly enhance the integration process. Data-driven approaches, such as implementing safety management systems or quality control software, enable organizations to capture, analyze, and act on information effectively. These systems provide real-time insights, facilitate decision-making, and drive continuous improvement efforts. Additionally, leveraging automation and digital solutions can streamline processes, reduce human error, and promote consistency in safety and quality practices.  Cultivating a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement is also essential for the successful integration of safety and quality management. Encouraging cross-functional teams to work together, share best practices, and learn from each other's experiences fosters innovation and drives positive change. By creating forums for feedback, recognition, and knowledge sharing, organizations can harness the collective expertise of their workforce to identify opportunities for improvement and implement solutions that benefit both safety and quality performance.  In conclusion, safety and quality management integration is a strategic imperative for organizations seeking to achieve operational excellence, enhance stakeholder satisfaction, and mitigate risks effectively. By aligning safety and quality objectives, implementing robust processes, fostering a culture of accountability, and leveraging technology, companies can optimize their performance and create a sustainable competitive advantage in today's dynamic business environment. Embracing this integrated approach not only safeguards the well-being of employees and customers but also promotes organizational resilience, innovation, and growth.""","841"

It refers a term of some computational techniques dependant upon the evolution of biological life in the natural world. Involved with combinatorial optimization problems, many kinds of EC models have been developed by some metaheuristic optimization algorithms, such as evolutionary is a subset of evolutionary computation, including evolutionary learning classifier systems. EC model can improve the electronic devices more intelligent to program itself without human preprogramming what was happening and without human intervention. It is widely used in the science and engineering area, such as innovative design, optimization, machine learning and flexible and adaptive system. Genetic is one of the most important EC techniques have been applied to solve practical problems in the rapidly growing field. Through three experiments of two maths function and a Robot Racing software which are all implemented by GAs method to evolve the parameters, it discern GAs have the positive impacts on the efficiency of searching optimized solutions to some specified problem.With the rapidly development of computer science and electronic engineering subjects, more and more advanced instruments those have the close relationship with human are invented to cause a digital resolution. They are changing the world and the human life. More and more hi-tech products are appearing among a variety of areas, from design of integrated to the application of artificial which is playing an important role in the modern world. AI is no longer only a movie which can not only be watched in its ever expanding influence to each corner of the world. The science of creating machines which can solve problems and reason like humans is usually referred to as artificial intelligence. AI can depend on different external situation to make a final decision like a reasonable human. Around us, it is easy to find that AI gives final opinions to help people make judgement on many issues in every day life. The most interesting application in the current age, is embedding AI technology into robot. However, most robots currently could only be considered as machines in our life but not intelligent. As stated by Murphy: 'While robots are mechanical, they don't have to be anthropomorphic or even animal-like.' For example, robot which delivers hospital meals to patients looks like a cart, not a nurse. So the robot associated with AI technology should have the ability to solve some problem without the preprogrammed by engineer. Moreover, the ability of learning can not be ignored on AI robot. It refers that robot can feel the influence of environment automatically and program itself to search the optimized solution so that it could cope with the unpredictable issue it met. Subsequently, each behaviour of AI robot causes it to contact the external world, and perceive the information of feedback about the change of the world through some instrument like sensor. The signals received are transmitted to the control centre which affect its former target and find a new way to meet it, immediately followed by generating a new cycle of actions. In the mean time, from high level of programming angle, to get machines programming themselves to figure out a most suitable way to process the digital signal received, the EC method by people like John Koza of Stanford University has been used to improve this process to create such 'intelligent machine'. This approach integrates the evolutional concept into computational problems to select out efficient way through searching among huge number of possibilities for solutions. In biology, the target of evolution is to produce the desired individual that is highly fit the variable environment. The individual is survived dependant upon its fitness in environment. The theory of 'survival of fitness' is Darwin stuff that 'through reproduction, inheritance and the occasional mutation within a population, individuals or groups of individuals with similar characteristics within that population would flourish when placed in a particular environment'. It is stated by Richard Gardiner who is trying to embed the EC method into his mobile robot 'Antaeus' to make it have the learning ability, a practical experiment at Cybernetics department of Reading University. So the simplified law of evolution is a continuous circle in which the individual is evolved by random variation such as mutation and crossover, and the fittest one which has the 'qualification' to survive could be picked up through natural selection, subsequently, their genetic stuff will be kept and past to a new generation to continue process in the same circle. For the robot control in the real world, the adaptive program is desired to be applied on control system so that it can make each robot make good performance in facing the variable environment. As stated above, some computational approaches inspired by biological evolution which is a theory supported by 'survival of fittest' and 'natural selection' can be used to realize the adaptive system on robot control. 'The candidate solutions represent each possible behavior of the robot and based on the overall performance of the candidates, each could be assigned a fitness value. Genetic operators could then be applied to improve the performance of the population of behaviors. One cycle of testing all of the competimg behavior is defined as a generation, and is repeated until a good behavior is evolved. The good behavior is then applied to the real world.' The software of robot racing is a competition for programmers and an on-going challenge for practice of Artificial Intelligence and real-time adaptive optimal control. It consists of a simulation of the physics of cars racing on a track, a graphic display of the race, and a separate control each car. This software can roughly simulate the robot control condition in the continuing changed environment. The evolutional approach which is used to modify the software is GA which was invented by John Holland in the 960s and developed by Holland and his students and colleagues at the University of Michigan in 960s and 970s. GA is integrated into the present software to evolve the parameters of each car. The time of each lap can be taken as the feedback which is the interaction with the environment. It reflects the result of the influence of GA and is directly transmitted into programming level to join the evolution. In this GA function, the lap time is fitness that illustrates how well the speed determined by those evolved parameters. It continually changes as parameters evolve. About the more details on evolution process and test result, will be showed in the following section of this report. Different from other evolutionary computation approaches which are used to solve specific problems, GA is to 'formally study the phenomenon of adaptation as it occurs in nature and to develop ways in which the mechanisms of natural adaptation might be imported into computer system'. Virtually, GA is a kind of adaptive algorithm based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection. The basic techniques of the GA are designed to simulate processes in natural systems of evolution which is inspired by the principles first laid down by Charles Darwin of survival of the fittest. GA following the principle of 'survival of the fittest' processes individuals over consecutive generation for solving the optimized searching problem. Each generation is consist of a variety of character strings or real-valued parameters those stand for the chromosome that seen in our DNA. Each individual represents a point in a search space and a possible solution. The individuals in the population are then made to go through a process of evolution. More details of implementation and application of EC will be illustrated later. So far, some basic idea and theory of EC and GA which is the popular EC approach are displayed above. This report is organized to discover the impact and development as well as some specific applications of EC. In the next section, the background and of EC are briefly introduced. To investigate how EC works on some practical problems, GA is applied to maths function to search peaks as well as the game software named robot racing to figure out the best parameters. Then the results of those three tasks will be illustrated and discussed to analyze the influence of GA. Background Evolutionary a subfield of artificial intelligence means design and application of computational model of evolutional approach which is based on the Darwinian theory. 'EC uses computational models of evolutionary processes as key elements in the design and implementation of computer-based problem solving systems. There are a variety of evolutionary computational models that have been proposed and studied which we will refer to as evolutionary algorithms. They share a common conceptual base of simulating the evolution of individual structures via processes of selection and reproduction. These processes depend on the perceived the individual structures as defined by an environment. More precisely, evolutionary algorithms maintain a population of structures that evolve according to rules of selection and other operators, such as recombination and mutation. Each individual in the population receives a measure of its fitness in the environment. Selection focuses attention on high fitness individuals, thus exploiting the available fitness information. Recombination and mutation perturb those individuals, providing general heuristics for exploration. ' Because EA is inspired by biological evolution, as mentioned above, reproduction, mutation, recombination, natural selection and survival of the fittest, so the illustration of EA can be offered by biological terms, although sometimes they do not have direct connection. To capture the main idea and structure of EA, the working flow of EA is list in the following lines. From lecture note of week: Through the pseudo code above, the procedure of EA is briefly described. In the first generation candidate an optimization problem evolves toward better solutions.' The application of GA is to search the optimized solution of a problem in the form of bit-strings and some neural networks, LISP expressions and real-valued vectors representation. In the basic structure of EA, selection, crossover and mutation, as three elemental types of operators, are involved to construct simplest form of GA. Basically, a simply GA is represented through the following step that is introduced in: Start from a population of randomly generated individuals of chromosomes which are candidate solutions to a problem. Calculate the fitness of each chromosome in the population. Set a loop to repeat evolution stuff to produce the offspring. The fitness is evaluated in each generation, and based on fitness the individuals who have higher relative fitness are more likely selected to be the parents of current generation to produce 'kids'. Using those found out parents, process the crossover which is used to exchange the information between the parents to form offspring. By recombining parts of good individuals, this process is likely to create even better individuals With some low mutation probability, the offspring which is just produced are mutated through specific approaches to replace chromosomes in new generation. Its purpose is to maintain diversity within the population and inhibit premature convergence. Update the current population with the new generation. Repeat from step which becomes current to start the next iteration of the algorithm. GA offers significant benefits over more typical search of optimization techniques, variation on the main structure of GA have been widely applied in diverse scientific and engineering topics such as optimization, automatic programming, machine learning, economics, immune systems, ecology, population genetics, social systems and so on. Because of the success of GA in these areas, more and more interests in GA have been sharply raised in the recent years by the researcher from any area. With the same theory of Darwinian concept which is survival of the fittest applied on GA, GP comes from the original work on genetic algorithm. 'GP is an automated methodology inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that best perform a user-defined task. It is therefore a particular machine learning technique that uses an evolutionary algorithm to optimize a population of computer programs according to a fitness landscape determined by a program's ability to perform a given computational task.' Although much of the theory associated with genetic operators is relied in GP as well, the hierarchical expression, which is manipulated in GP, is far different from the coded strings of GA. The hierarchical structure is a tree manipulation routine but not a flat and one dimensional string. Similar as GP, based on the fixed structure of program which is the only fixed thing, EP is evolved by its numerical parameters. Traditionally, Representation and operators were specialized for the application area which is evolving finite state automata for machine learning tasks. Nowadays, it is often used as optimizer with any representation, such as real valued vectors are using in population to solve the real valued optimization problems. Also for the traveling salesman problems, ordered lists are called and graphs orient to applications with finite state machines. From the lecture note of week, the basic EP was formed by three basic an initial population of trial solutions at random. Mutate each offspring. Select a number of solutions based on fitness. Compared with EP, typically, ES is applied to real-valued parameter optimization. The main characteristic feature of ES concentrates on self-adaptive mutation using standard deviation of Gaussian distribution to make each individual have an adaptive mutation. Typically ES is applied to real-valued parameter optimization problems Nevertheless, during the recent years, interaction and communication among various evolutionary computation methods have been widely developed. 'the boundaries between GAs, evolutionary strategies', evolutionary programming, and other evolutionary approaches have broken down to some extent.' Next section, GA method will be detailed and analyzed involved with actual examples. Methods, Results and DiscussionThe applications of GA have been spread to a variety of fields, because GA can effectively find an optimized solution in a complicated search space through input limited information so that it is an effective searching procedure compared with other method. Basically, when GA is applied to face the present problem, the performance of GA will depend on the elements: encoding candidate solutions and the method of evaluating the corresponding performance of candidate solution, which is used to test whether it is the optimized solutions. In this section, the applications of GA on a maths function and a software of Robot Auto Racing Simulation will be illustrated to explain and present how to implement GA on practical problem and how well to use GA to search the optimized solutions. Task The task is to figure out the maximum value of present maths function when the location of variable is between 'zero' to 'twoPI'. A GA can be used to search the single peak of this function. It begins with a set of randomly selected points which is the input 'x' variable of this function. Then the best performers will be selected out from those highlighted points through fitness testing. Crossover combines the best attributes from the most successful individuals of the population, and mutation randomly add up new characteristics that would produce better solutions. The function is 'y=x /(float)RAND_MAX' will result in a random floating point number between and. That expression will become true when that is less than.5/8 which means it has a % chance of succeeding. At this percentage, random numbers which are between - pi/ and pi/ are added up to the selected individuals to achieve the diversity. Then pi is used to make the modified members locate at the area between to 'pi'. After three GA operator functions, in the main function, population is initialized so that it contains random values distributed between specified minimum and maximum values. The size of population for each generation can influence the efficiency of GA. If there is a large population size of population, then many calculations of fitness are present to process which consume long waiting time of entire algorithm. To avoid the condition that GA converges a local optimal peak so quickly that misses global peak, the size of population can not be set too small. So, to search one global peak in the specified area, the size of population is set to 0. Subsequently, a loop which is counted by generation number is applied to evolve the x value where the global peak locates. The fitness function is called first to calculate fitness for the population in the current generation. For the selection part, the population should be put into a kind of order. In this problem, because the target is to search the peak of function in the specified area, moreover, the fitness is represented by y value, so the order should be ascendant. The x value is sorted at the ascendant order depend on the fitness. The method used is 'bubble sort'. Following the sorted order, first top members are randomly picked out to do crossover and mutation so that the fitter member will have a greater chance of reproducing. Therefore, in successive generations, the fitness of each member on average will be continuously higher. 'r1' and 'r2' are the random integer numbers from to. It means any two members list at the top in the current generation have the same probability to be picked out to do crossover and mutation. Moreover, in the crossover function, if a pair of parents produces one child, the crossover and mutation must be processed ten times. Otherwise, if there are two children per time, then the counter 'i' of this loop should be set to. So a new generation is produced to replace the current one. After,00 generation, the peak can be figured out. The output of the software is: Nevertheless, among several tens of experiment, there is a strange unreasonable result. The reasons why this condition could happen seem like that the optimal values have not been traversed by search function to reproduce or searched optimal point is lost due to random crossover and mutation. When producing offspring, there is high probability of crossover and mutation happening on the individuals even including the optimal point. So a number of good individuals are destroyed by crossover and mutation. To avoid loss of the best found individuals caused by the above reasons, elitism can be introduced into the GA, and put it at the position ahead selection. Elitism is to force GA to copy some better individuals directly to offspring, so those best chromosomes can be kept at each generation. And all the rest members can be constructed through the normal way, such as crossover and mutation. 'Elitism is important since it allows the solutions to get better over time. If you pick only the few best parents, and replace always the worst, the population will converge quicker. this means all the individuals will more or less all be the same.' Because of the contribution of elitism, the performance of GA can be sharply improved. In task, to figure out the maximum value in the specified area, only the first chromosome need be copied to the next generation after bubble up sorting, which is the fittest individual. And process crossover and mutation to construct other members for new generation. Screenshot of task output: Task The requirement of task is to find the values for the four highest peaks of function: y=x+ between x and twopi. Based on the concept and application of GA in the task one which is to search the maximum value, some details in the algorithm should be modified. What is intended to do for searching first four peaks in the present function, is to figure out all the x values which locate at the peak positions. What is meant by this is that all the selected x values can generate the peaks so that the question is transferred into searching first four highest output values among the selected x input which can produce the local peak values. Subsequently, they are processed by GA as task. Above algorithm is applied when doing random x value to make the selected x which is for local peak so that they can be used to generate first four global peaks. Also it is utilized in the main body when mutation function is called at each generation. The first four values in the sorted array should be the ideal output. However, it does not work. The reason considered is that the searching area that is between and pi is too narrow so that the possibility of finding suitable points through random approach is too low. When extend the searching area from pi to 0000pi, still there is no output. So the approach applied in task is not successful. Task Task is to embed GA into robot racing. The software of robot racing is a competition for programmers and an on-going challenge for practice of Artificial Intelligence and real-time adaptive optimal control. It consists of a simulation of the physics of cars racing on a track, a graphic display of the race, and a separate control each car. GA is applied to search the best values of some specific parameters which are defined already for cars. So GA can figure out the optimized values of those parameters which will influence the speed of car to realize the best performance for each one. In one of the present car files, BURNS, all the related parameters are list. CORN_SPD_CON which determines how fast to take corners is selected to be evolved by GA. Compared with the basic application of GA in task, the input is corner speed and output is lap time which can be returned from main function when processing the racing programming, moreover the lap time returned can reflect the influence of GA on racing corner speed. So following the approach in task, set lap-time which is output as fitness. If the lap time is shorter, then the corner speed will be fitter. So depend on the fitness that is set to each value, all the values in the current generation should be sorted at the ascend order opposite to the order in task which is at descend order. All the rest GA processes are same as what have been done in task, such as selection, crossover and mutation. When finishing last generation, the first individual which is the evolved value making the lap time be shortest is optimized final corner speed. The lap time is getting shorter with the growing of generation, and finally the optimized corner speed can be found. Furthermore, not only corner speed can impact the lap time, but also all the rest of parameters have vital contributions on the racing speed. So, all the parameters can be evolved by GA to get a group of optimal parameters to improve the performance of car to be perfect. Conclusion From the statement of theory and three applications on practical problems in this report, it is obvious to discern that EC is a powerful tool to solve problem in a wide variety of scientific and engineering research area. It has been developed to a field which is importing biological technology into computation design. As the most popular evolutionary algorithm, the application of GA causes a great leap in development of intelligent computation. Through the exam on the maths function, it can be seen that GA can solve the problem of searching maximum value and first four highest peak values, moreover, compared with the figure plotted out by MATLAB, the results are precise but only a bit error around.1 on x value. Meanwhile, GA also has good performance in real world problem which is a simulation of car racing. Rely on the output file including time of each lap, which shows the time is getting shorter and shorter, it can be figured out that the parameter is evolved to be fitter and fitter with this search approach inspired by biology theory. However, only one parameter of car is evolved in this report, if a set of parameters of one car can be processed by GA as well, the performance of the car will be completely perfect after several laps. However, in the area of working electronic devices, still some problem can not be solved due to scalability. To cope with more complex conditions, the traditional approach of EC must be added up information by human, because all the parameters in the conventional GA method need to be defined to corresponding binary value. It refers that the EC approach as mentioned in this report is lack of one important nature like element, development. As stated by Peter Bentley, who is the head of the Digital Biology Group at University College London, 'The idea is that, by incorporating development, you avoid the one to one correspondence between a gene and a parameter. We are trying to get to the point where the genome is more like a recipe; a set of instruction should grow, rather than a complete blueprint specifying every last detail in advance.' So, in this open area, much work such as how to implement it into algorithm and how to incorporate with other field knowledge should be considered to improve EC to realize the dream of completely natural computation method in AI world.""","""Evolutionary computation in artificial intelligence""","4735","""Evolutionary computation in artificial intelligence (AI) is a fascinating field that draws inspiration from biological evolution to solve complex problems. This innovative approach mimics the process of natural selection to generate solutions by evolving a population of candidate solutions over multiple generations. By simulating the principles of genetics, mutation, recombination, and selection, evolutionary algorithms can optimize solutions in diverse domains, from engineering design to financial modeling and beyond. In this comprehensive exploration, we delve into the intricacies of evolutionary computation, its various algorithms, applications, strengths, limitations, and future prospects in the realm of artificial intelligence.  At the heart of evolutionary computation lies the concept of evolution itself. Drawing from Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, evolutionary algorithms model the survival of the fittest within a population of potential solutions to a given problem. This population undergoes iterative cycles of evolution, where new candidate solutions emerge through a combination of genetic operators such as mutation and crossover. These new solutions are then evaluated based on a fitness function that quantifies how well they perform the desired task. The fittest individuals are selected to propagate to the next generation, gradually improving the overall quality of solutions over successive iterations.  One of the key strengths of evolutionary computation is its ability to explore vast solution spaces and find high-quality solutions in complex, multidimensional search spaces where traditional optimization techniques may struggle. Evolutionary algorithms excel in handling non-linear, non-convex, and multimodal optimization problems that are common in real-world applications. Their stochastic nature allows them to escape local optima and discover diverse solutions across the search landscape, making them versatile tools for a wide range of optimization tasks.  Several prominent evolutionary algorithms have been developed to tackle different types of optimization problems. Genetic Algorithms (GAs), perhaps the most well-known evolutionary algorithm, use principles of natural selection to evolve a population of candidate solutions through selection, crossover, and mutation operators. Genetic Programming (GP) extends this concept to evolve computer programs or models rather than fixed-length solutions, making it suitable for symbolic regression, program synthesis, and automated design tasks. Evolution Strategies (ES) focus on optimizing real-valued parameters using self-adaptation mechanisms inspired by biological evolution. Differential Evolution (DE) emphasizes mutation and recombination strategies to efficiently explore solution spaces and has shown effectiveness in global optimization problems.  Apart from these classic algorithms, more recent advancements in evolutionary computation have led to the development of niche-oriented techniques such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA). These methods leverage the principles of swarm intelligence, ant colony foraging behavior, and probabilistic models, respectively, to efficiently navigate complex search spaces and find optimal solutions. Each algorithm comes with its unique strengths and is tailored to specific problem domains, offering a diverse toolkit for solving a wide range of optimization challenges.  The adoption of evolutionary computation spans various domains and applications, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in solving complex problems. In engineering and design, evolutionary algorithms have been used for optimal structural design, aerodynamic shape optimization, antenna design, and parameter tuning in control systems. In finance, they find applications in portfolio optimization, risk management, algorithmic trading, and modeling financial markets. Evolutionary computation also plays a crucial role in data mining, machine learning, bioinformatics, game playing, and many other fields where optimization and search are fundamental tasks.  Despite its numerous strengths, evolutionary computation is not without its limitations and challenges. One common issue is the computational cost associated with evolving large populations over numerous generations, especially for high-dimensional problems with expensive objective functions. Convergence to the optimal solution can be slow, particularly in multimodal and deceptive landscapes where the presence of multiple optima hinders the search process. Additionally, setting appropriate algorithm parameters such as population size, mutation rate, and crossover probability can be a non-trivial task and may require expertise to tune effectively.  Research in evolutionary computation continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to address these challenges and push the boundaries of what is achievable through AI-driven optimization. Hybrid approaches that combine evolutionary algorithms with other optimization techniques, such as gradient-based methods or local search algorithms, have shown promise in improving convergence speed and solution quality. Parallel and distributed evolutionary algorithms leverage the power of modern computing architectures to speed up the optimization process by performing evaluations in parallel across multiple processors or machines.  The field of evolutionary computation is also witnessing innovations in multi-objective optimization, dynamic optimization, constrained optimization, and surrogate-assisted optimization. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms aim to optimize conflicting objectives simultaneously, leading to a set of trade-off solutions known as the Pareto front. Dynamic optimization algorithms adaptively respond to changes in the optimization landscape over time, making them suitable for problems with varying or unknown environments. Constrained optimization techniques incorporate constraints into the evolutionary process to ensure feasible solutions that satisfy all problem constraints.  As AI technologies continue to advance, the future of evolutionary computation looks promising, with opportunities for integrating evolutionary algorithms into emerging areas such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and automated machine learning. Evolutionary approaches have the potential to enhance neural network architecture search, hyperparameter optimization, and model adaptation tasks by leveraging their ability to explore diverse solution spaces and adapt to changing problem settings. The synergy between evolutionary computation and other AI paradigms holds the key to unlocking new frontiers in intelligent optimization and decision-making.  In conclusion, evolutionary computation in artificial intelligence stands as a powerful paradigm for solving complex optimization problems across diverse domains. By emulating the principles of biological evolution, evolutionary algorithms offer a robust framework for generating high-quality solutions through iterative search and adaptation. With a rich repertoire of algorithms, applications, and ongoing research efforts, evolutionary computation continues to thrive as a versatile and effective tool for tackling challenging optimization tasks in the era of AI-driven innovation.""","1150"
"260","""The ear is our organ of hearing; throughout the world there are some '5/80 million people who have a disabling hearing impairment' (World health organisation, URL ). If the impairment is from birth or a young age it can lead to a retardation of development by causing a delay in language acquisition and impede school progress. Hearing impairment in adults can lead to vocational and economic difficulties resulting in social isolation and stigmatisation. In the UK there is estimated to be about million deaf and hard of hearing people, this number is rising as the number of people over 0 increases. Of the million 98,00 adults are estimated to be severely or profoundly deaf, 0,00 children between the ages of and 5/8 are moderately to profoundly deaf, 2,00 of these children were born deaf. (Statistics from RNID, URL ) Basic anatomy of the ear and physiology of hearing. The ear is made up of three different parts, the outer, middle and inner ear. The outer or external ear consists of the pinna and external auditory canal. Sound travels along the passage to the is situated at the end. The canal also contains hairs and glands which produce the is a connection between the middle ear and pharynx via the Eustachian tube which helps to equalise air pressure. The inner ear is made up of two parts, the cochlea and semicircular canals. Along the length of the cochlea are tiny hair cells, each cell has stereocilia which project into the cochlear fluid. 'When sound waves enter the cochlea the stereocilia are moved which causes the hair cells to trigger an electrical pulse in the auditory nerve' (Burton et al, 000). The nerve passes impulses to the brain which recognise them as different sounds. The semicircular canals are not used for hearing; they are part of your balance system. DeafnessThere are many ways in which you could classify types of deafness, one way of doing this is to categorise deafness into varying severity. 'Threshold is the level at which you can just make out the tone of a particular frequency. Thresholds are measured in decibels for hearing ) a foreign object can block the ear canal causing temporary conductive deafness. ii)Excess Mucous - The common cold or hay fever can cause an excessive production of mucous which may block the Eustachian tubes. iii)Ear infections - Otitis media/externa can cause fluid and pus accumulation which damps down the conduction of sound iv)Drugs - Aminoglycosides and chloroquine can cause temporary deafness in susceptible people.. Age related hearing lossThis is termed presbycusis, our hearing gradually becomes less acute as we age, this is normal and rarely leads to complete deafness. Higher frequencies are typically loss first. Ear Examination and Hearing TestsA thorough examination of a persons hearing requires an ear examination and hearing tests. The ear examinationThis involves inserting an otoscope into the ear canal which allows you to view the canal and the tympanic membrane. may be carried out for the following reasons: i) To screen newborns and young children for hearing problems. ii) As part of a routine physical examination iii) To evaluate possible hearing loss in anyone who has noticed a persistent hearing problem. iv) To screen for hearing loss in people who are repeatedly exposed to loud noises. v) To determine the amount and type of hearing loss experienced by a person. (web MDhealth, URL ) Types of Hearing test1. Whispered Speech TestAccording to the systematic review carried out by Pirozzo at al, 003, 'the whispered voice test is a simple and accurate screening test for detecting hearing impairment which can be carried out in children and adults'. The examiner stands at arms length behind the seated patient and whispers a combination of numbers and letter. They then ask the patient to repeat the sequence. The patient is deemed to have passed if the answer three out of the six letter or numbers correctly. Although this is a quick and easy screen which can be carried out in the community, it is difficult to standardise the test by controlling the loudness of the whisper.. Pure tone audiometryThe usual primary purpose of pure-tone tests is to determine the type and degree of hearing loss. (Mullin-Derrick & Campbell, 004) define pure tone audiometry as 'a behavioural test measure used to determine hearing sensitivity. Pure tone the softest sound audible to an individual at least 0% of the time. Hearing sensitivity is plotted on an audiogram, which is a graph displaying intensity as a function of frequency'. The test is carried out by a pure tone audiometer, which produces a range of pure tones at varying intensity in decibel steps. The sounds are played through a set of headphones which are placed on the patient. 'The health professional will send a tone and reduce its loudness until you can no longer hear it. Then the tone will get louder until you can hear it again. The patient signals by raising their hand or pressing a button every time they hear a tone.' (My webMD, URL ) The test is suitable for children above the age of three and adults; this is on the condition that they can respond to commands. The white area on the diagram indicates the sounds that the person would not hear; they are termed 'softer than threshold sounds'. The grey area demonstrates the sounds that the person would be able to hear i.e. the 'louder than threshold sounds'. This audiogram shows significant hearing loss over the higher frequencies in sounds up to 0 decibels. This audiogram shows hearing loss of sounds of all frequencies below 0 decibels. All audiogram figures taken.Tuning fork testsThese are crude tests but are routinely used in clinical examination. Rinne's testThis compares the patients ability to hear a tone conducted via air and bone. 'A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process and then help in line with the external auditory meatus. The patient is asked whether the sound is louder behind or in front referring to bone and air conduction respectively' (GP notebook, URL ). In the normal ear, air conduction is better than bone and so the tone is heard more clearly at the external meatus. Conductive hearing loss, the sound is heard better over the mastoid process. Weber's testThis compares bone conduction in both ears. 'A vibrating tuning fork is placed in the centre of the forehead. The patient is asked if the sound is heard in the midline or to one side' (GP notebook, URL ). If hearing is normal the patient perceives the sound in the midline. If there is unilateral conductive loss the patient perceives the sound in the ear with conductive loss. If there is unilateral sensorineural loss the patient perceives the sound in the ear with the better cochlea. A drawback to the rinne's and weber's test according to Mulrow, 991, is that 'because the tuning fork test evaluates hearing at a single low frequency, it is not appropriate for most elderly patients. This is because most of them have presbycusis and have lost the ability to hear high frequencies.'. Otoacoustic emissionAs discussed previously, external sound waves move the basilar membrane in the cochlea. The cochlea itself then produces sounds and these are termed otoacoustic emissions. Otoacousitc emissions can then be detected and measured by a microphone in the external ear. Hinton & Moore Gillon, 994 have found that 'emissions are more easily recordable in younger subjects than in older people. This makes the technique particularly valuable in those in whom the more conventional tests of hearing function, which require a subjective response and the cooperation of the patient, difficult. This test which takes around ten minutes has obvious potential as a screening test in neonates. Auditory brainstem evoked potentialFor this test electrodes are placed on the scalp and each earlobe. Clicking noises are then sent through earphones. The electrodes monitor the brains response to the clicking noises and record the response on a graph. This test detects sensorineural hearing loss. SummaryThis essay has identified various tests which can be used to assess hearing. It is clear that screening neonates and children for hearing defects is important. The earlier the problems can be identified and managed, the better long term prospects for the child and family who will then receive the specialised support they need. Routine clinical examination has a place, but mainly in the detection of ear infections and cerumen via an otoscope. The tuning fork tests will give an immediate indication as to whether there is a hearing deficit present; however these tests are crude and can only be applied if the patient can understand and follow a command. It has been highlighted that they are of little use in elderly patients due to the loss of ability, to hear high frequencies as we age. The whispered speech test has advantages in that it is cheap, quick and can be performed on mass in the community by a range of health professionals. I.e. health visitors. This makes it a convenient test for screening purposes. However its major disadvantage is that again the patient needs to be able to understand a command and respond, which is only possible in children above approximately years old. Another problem is standardising this test due to the loudness of the whisper. The pure tone audiometry is probably the gold standard test; it is the most accurate at determining the type and extent of hearing loss. Its disadvantage is that it needs to be carried out in a specialised department by a technician. This renders it ineffective for community screening. Finally the two tests which can be used in neonates and patients which cannot respond to a command are otoacoustic emission and auditory brainstem evoked response. The drawback to both these tests is that they require specialised equipment and so it is difficult to take them out into the community.""","""Hearing impairment and assessment methods""","2022","""Hearing impairment is a prevalent sensory disability that affects millions of people worldwide. It can range from mild to profound, impacting an individual's ability to communicate effectively, engage with their environment, and participate in various activities. Assessing hearing loss is a crucial first step in managing this condition and helping individuals receive appropriate interventions to improve their quality of life. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the various aspects of hearing impairment, assessment methods, and the significance of early detection and intervention.  **Understanding Hearing Impairment**  Hearing impairment, also known as hearing loss, can be categorized based on the severity and the specific part of the auditory system affected. The degrees of hearing loss include mild, moderate, severe, and profound. Furthermore, hearing loss can be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. Conductive hearing loss occurs when sound cannot pass efficiently through the outer and middle ear, while sensorineural hearing loss involves damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve. Mixed hearing loss is a combination of both types.  **Causes of Hearing Impairment**  There are various causes of hearing impairment, including genetics, aging, exposure to loud noise, ototoxic medications, infections, and medical conditions such as Meniere's disease. For some individuals, hearing loss may be present at birth (congenital), while for others, it may develop later in life (acquired). It is essential to identify the underlying cause of hearing loss to determine the most appropriate treatment and management strategies.  **Signs and Symptoms**  Recognizing the signs of hearing impairment is crucial for early detection and intervention. Common signs include difficulty following conversations, frequently asking others to repeat themselves, turning up the volume on electronic devices, withdrawing from social interactions, and struggling to hear in noisy environments. Children with hearing loss may exhibit delays in speech and language development.  **Assessment Methods**  Assessing hearing impairment involves a comprehensive evaluation by audiologists and other healthcare professionals. Various assessment methods are used to determine the type, degree, and configuration of hearing loss. These methods include:  1. **Audiometry**: This is the most common test used to assess hearing ability. Pure-tone audiometry involves listening to tones at different frequencies and volumes to evaluate the individual's hearing thresholds.  2. **Speech Audiometry**: This test assesses the individual's ability to recognize and repeat words presented at varying volumes.  3. **Tympanometry**: This test measures the movement of the eardrum and can help identify conditions affecting the middle ear.  4. **Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE)**: This test assesses the function of the hair cells in the inner ear by measuring the sound emissions produced in response to stimuli.  5. **Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR)**: ABR measures the brain's response to sound stimuli and can help identify hearing loss in newborns and young children who cannot participate in traditional hearing tests.  6. **Electrocochleography (EcochG)**: This test evaluates the electrical potentials generated in the inner ear in response to sound stimulation.  **Importance of Early Assessment and Intervention**  Early assessment of hearing impairment is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, early detection allows for prompt intervention, which can help prevent further deterioration of hearing and mitigate the impact on an individual's communication skills and quality of life. It also enables healthcare providers to identify any underlying medical conditions causing hearing loss that may require treatment.  **Intervention and Management**  The management of hearing impairment depends on various factors, including the type and severity of the hearing loss, the individual's age, and their communication needs. Some common interventions include hearing aids, cochlear implants for severe to profound hearing loss, assistive listening devices, auditory training, and speech therapy. For children with hearing loss, early intervention services, such as speech and language therapy, are vital for promoting language development and academic success.  **Conclusion**  In conclusion, hearing impairment is a significant health concern that can impact individuals of all ages. Through thorough assessment methods and early intervention, individuals with hearing loss can receive appropriate support and interventions to improve their communication abilities and overall quality of life. It is essential for healthcare providers, educators, and families to work together to ensure that individuals with hearing impairment receive the necessary evaluation and interventions tailored to their specific needs. By raising awareness, promoting regular hearing screenings, and investing in accessible services, we can create a more inclusive society where individuals with hearing loss can thrive and participate fully in all aspects of life.""","903"
"136","""With the dramatic change in workplace, the demand for the highest quality in both products and services is increasing drastically. Hence, employee commitment becomes crucial if the company has to remain competitive whilst facing all these business pressures. The front-line staff in an organization, like sales assistants, receptionists, etc., plays a major role here, as these are the ones that come in contact with the customers the most. Organisations today are giving increasing importance to the front-line staff as the management realizes that excellence in service can be achieved only by means of having efficient and dedicated employees as their front-line staff. The employees occupying the position, as front-line staff should not just be friendly to their customers but they should be masters in what they are doing to please customers. (Schlesinger and Heskett, 991) COMMITMENTCommitment was always believed to be a 'taken for granted' directing behaviour. But recent studies have conceived commitment in two distinct ways. The orthodox approach refers to commitment as an individuals psychological bond to an organisation, as 'affective attachment and identification'. (Cooper and Hartley in Legge, 005/8: 14) but the definition usually employed was given by Porteral. that define commitment as the relative virtue of an individual's involvement with or in an organisation. Because of the difficulty in relating the variations in employee commitment, contrasting views emerged that defined it as ' the binding of an individual to behavioural acts' (Kiesler and Sakumura in Legge, 005/8:15/8). This approach sees commitment to be in terms of the cost lost to the individual if he/she were to leave it. So, according to this definition individuals are more likely to be in the organisation if the organisation high. BASES OF COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMER SERVICETo understand employee commitment to customer service better, behavioural approach can be taken into consideration. Behavioural approach means how well can an employee manage to satisfy the needs of a customer on an individual level, i.e. to what extent can an employee go to provide exemplary service to its customers. Generally, in providing exceptional customer service to its customers, in comparison with its competitor organisations, an individual employee undertakes round-the-clock improvement on the job together with exercising effort and striving for the welfare and interest of its customers. Employees continuously strive for quality, this is not just a psychological state of mind or simply an optimistic attitude, this is of utmost importance to the employee, owning to the fact that it involves expenditure of energy and effort on part of the employee. The four major bases of employee commitment to customer service are affective, normative, calculative and altruistic. (Etzioni, 988; Coleman, 990 quoted in Peccei and Rosenthal). Affective CommitmentAs described by Allen and Meyer the affective basis for employee commitment is where an employee is emotionally attached to an organisation. In this case, the employee devotes himself completely to serving the organisation better, forming an emotional attachment with the organisation. Providing high quality service to customers delivers a sense of innate contentedness to the employee. An employee develops emotional bonds with the organisation when he/she understands and identifies the goals and values of an organisation and is inclined to provide cooperation and support to the organisation in achieving these goals. Here, employees strive for excellence and please the customers in every possible way because they enjoy doing it. (Peccei and Rosenthal, 997) When an individual attaches his/her 'fund of affectivity and emotion to the group' (Kanter, 968: 07), invests emotional energy in the group and is loyal to its members and the organisation as a whole, it can be described as 'cathectic cohesion commitment', which is commitment to some social relations. (Kanter, 968) Commitment can also be understood as 'partisan, affective attachment to goals and values of an organisation' (Buchanan II, 974: 33) wherein an employee is attached to an organisation for his/her own interest, not forgetting that his contribution is extremely crucial for the entire organisation. Here, an individual truly believes in and acknowledges an organisation's goals and values, is inclined to work hard for its success and aspires to work for it enduringly. (Mowday, Steers and Porter, 979) Normative CommitmentNormative commitment is not as well known as affective, but is extremely practicable; here an individual does something because he has been brought up to do so. Here, 'Customer service behaviour would be normatively driven, based on the internalization of appropriate service values and norms by the individual' (Peccei and Rosenthal, 997:0) and employees try to give their best and please customers only because they believe it is their moral obligation to do so. An individual considers work as his duty and responsibility towards the organisation. (Allen and Meyer, 990) Normative commitment is an obligation to perform and can be defined as 'totality of internalized normative pressures to act in a way which meets organizational goals and interests' (Wiener, 982: 71). The only way an employee will not be concerned about the repercussions of what he does is when he/she is extremely committed and inclined towards work. Employees that are committed to the organization show behaviour different from the non- committed employees. They stand out as they perform their job not because they aim at making profits but because they know and understand that 'it is the 'right' and moral thing to do' (Wiener, 982: 71) Randall and Cote, consider normative commitment as the moral obligation or duty that an individual develops owing to the fact that an organisation is investing in them. Employees may feel they have a moral commitment working in the organisation when they realize that the organisation has spent a lot of time as well as effort in training and developing them. Eg. when an organisation pays an employee's academic fees in order to improve their qualification. The employee may feel obliged to pay the organisation back by continuously working for it after completing their studies. Generally, normative commitment occurs when an employee finds it hard to reimburse the investment an organisation has made in them. O'Reillyal., used value to explain commitment. When there is unanimity between an organisation and employee's values organisational commitment results. Schoorman and Mayer supported this assumption and explained how value commitment exits only when an employee acknowledges or believes in an organisation's goals and values. In accordance with Allen and Meyer's argument, Jaros et al. consider normative commitment to be moral commitment. The difference between affective and normative commitment becomes clear, as normative commitment is only a moral obligation or duty and not an emotional connection with the organisation. The degree of an employee's psychological attachment to his/her organisation is described by means of internalization of both values and organisational goals. Calculative CommitmentThe earliest portrayal of calculative commitment approach was by Etzioni, in 961 and he was amongst the first ones to say that calculative commitment of an employee is a give and take affair. An employee aims at providing excellent service to customers but only as a means to gain benefits in the form of rewards, promotion, recognition, etc. from the organisation. Individuals work hard on behalf of the customers, presenting their problem to their seniors/superiors, as a calculated move as employees are aware that pleasing customers would mean rewards and benefits. Thus, employees benefit themselves by this process of pleasing and serving customers. Providing high quality service is given paramount importance in all three approaches and forms a very crucial work goal for an employee, but for very different reasons. In case of calculative the reason being gaining rewards and returns from the organisation for their work towards satisfying customers. The strength of an individual's calculative orientation to customer service can be captured by the following expression: Calculative commitment can be clearly understood as optimistic or pessimistic orientation of a minute intensity that arises owing to the contributions made by employees to the organisation, generally matching the level of performance and contributions made by an individual. Penley and Gould describe calculative attachment as 'a commitment to an organisation which is based on the employee's receiving inducements to match contributions' (Penley and Gould 988:6) This form of organisational commitment is based on mutual exchange. This attachment is conceptually more of less like the circumstances explained by Wiener where rewards and recognition solely influence the behaviour of an individual. Hence, it can be said that calculative commitment is distinct from affective commitment. Randall and O'Driscoll, define calculative commitment as one 'based on an exchange relationship with the organization' (Randall and O'Driscoll, 997:06) Employees develop commitment to an organisation because they foresee a bright future in the organisation in terms of promotions and other cost benefits. Generally, employees committed to an organisation in this way continue to work with the organisation because they need to do so for their benefit. The extent to which employees in an organisation are committed is not simply a result of how well an organisation rewards them for their performance. The indices of commitment as described by Nick Oliver, suggest that rewards and investments have an equally important role and need to co-exist. Rewards help in increasing only loyalty towards the job and the organisation, together with a sense of satisfaction from the job where as investments are important in relation with the objectives of the organisation, regularity, participation, etc. This clearly indicates that different aspects of behaviour are governed by different mechanisms of employee commitment and simply providing rewards becomes largely unreasonable. Altruistic CommitmentThe organisation is given primary importance by the employee in this case. The sole reason for an individual's commitment is a strong connection and identification with the organisation. This can therefore be understood as organisational type of customer service, which represents 'other-oriented, altruistic action'. (Peccei and Rosenthal, 997:1). The organisation in question is the only one to benefit heavily from altruistic approach to employee commitment hence making this approach very different from the others mentioned above. According to Peccei and Rosenthal, the extent to which an employee is attached to the organisation can be measured taking into consideration two variables: By multiplying the scores of various respondents on 'organisational commitment' by 'customer service climate' a combined measure of an employee's altruistic inclination towards customer service was formed. It is seen that individuals who are committed to the organisation they are working in, are very likely to give a lot of emphasis to the quality of service together with giving importance to pleasing and satisfying the organisation's customers. The above approaches may all be 'analytically distinct' but they are not essentially 'mutually exclusive' (Peccei and Rosenthal, 997:1) EMOTIONAL LABOURThe beginning of 980s saw the decrease of the manufacturing sector, the expansion of the service sector and the increased participation of female workers in the labour market which led to the attention on the concept of emotional its employees, as management cannot possibly train their employees with regard to every possible interaction between them and the customers, although they attempt to prescribe the likely feelings and expressions of customers. However, to eliminate negative discretion and encourage positive, the emotional labour within the organisation is supervised by monitoring and controlling that are associated with performed-related pay system. Furthermore, employees are forced to deploy emotional labour - deep act rather than surface act -, not least due to the changing concept of service from technical delivery towards focusing on how it is delivered and competitive environment in the service, it will not be wrong to say that the management of emotion refers not only to managing our own but others' emotions as well. (Class Notes OPBC, 005/8) In achieving organisational commitment aimed at affective commitment approach, i.e. where an employee really enjoys his job, recruitment of people who are friendly or do not find it difficult to communicate with people and have a natural talent for it will help the organisation positively. For an organisation to be successful in today's competitive scenario relying solely on how an employee naturally is or on an employee's basic and personal characteristics is not adequate hence, rewards and promotions have to be given on a regular basis to encourage employees from being more productive for the organisation. Rewarding employees helps to achieve calculative commitment. Having firm control over their emotions plays a very important role whilst dealing with customers as employees come across all kinds of customers. Therefore it becomes imperative for organisations to provide training opportunities to its employees on a regular basis to improve all kinds of skills resulting in quality enhancement that elicits normative commitment towards the organisation. To achieve altruistic commitment, the management should know how to mould its employee's mindset to one, who respects and connects with the organisation so as to be extremely loyal to it. Using language effectively and persuasively is solely to make the customers comfortable, loyal and connected to the organisation, in reality however, increasing importance is given to changing behaviour more than values and emotions. Typically, Employees will not fit into only a single category but will change depending on work pressure, job autonomy and trust in employment how an employee performs emotional labour in either one of the ways mentioned above. The individual in question may follow display rules by means of 'surface acting', which is not a genuine feeling. This involves showing emotions that are not actually experienced, this is achieved by a systematic procedure involving verbal as well as non-verbal signals, including facial expressions, tone of voice, etc. An airhostess describes how she would make sure that the passengers on board do not panic in a crisis situation- ' Even though I'm a very honest person, I have allowed my face not to mirror my alarm or my fright. I feel very protective of my passengers. my voice might quiver a little. I feel we could get them to believe.' (Hochschild, 983: 07) The airhostess uses surface acting to show how calm she is in a crisis, when actually the opposite is true. This is more like ' smiling but not meaning it' (Class Notes OPBC, 005/8) Deep ActingThe employees in this case 'psyche themselves' in such a way so as to experience a desired emotion. An airhostess describes how she controls herself when a customer is really annoying to her-'Watch it. Don't let him get to you' (Hochschild, 983: 5/8). Here, excessive training is provided to an employee in order to prepare him to face all kinds of situations, which might result in normative commitment. This is more like ' smiling and sometimes meaning it' (Class Notes OPBC, 005/8) Spontaneous and Genuine EmotionAn employee may naturally experience what one might be expected to say in a particular situation and emotions do not always have to be worked out. A nurse who might show grief in the form of a sigh on seeing an injured child might not have to 'act', the emotion comes in naturally. (Hochschild, 983). Genuine emotions and genuine commitment to an organisation are something that cannot be taught to an employee through a training process but it comes from within. This is more like ' smiling and meaning it' (Class Notes OPBC, 005/8) All the above management of emotions result in employees becoming more committed towards their organisation owing to the fact that they feel involved in the organisation in a variety of ways. CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, it can be said that for an organisation to be successful in comparison to its competitors, it must know how to keep its employees committed, reducing turnover. Understanding the bases of employee commitment is a means through which it becomes easy for an organisation to decipher how to maintain its human resource in the organisation. To keep an employee satisfied is the duty of an organisation and this satisfaction eventually leads to commitment or loyalty towards the organisation. Being a part of the service sector means dealing with all kinds of customers on a large scale. This can be achieved successfully only if an employee has a firm control over his/her emotions, in the absence of which dealing with such a huge pool of consumers is a 'Herculean' task. An employee will only be willing to go that extra mile for his/her organisation if he/she is committed in an affective, normative, calculative or altruistic way.""","""Employee Commitment in Customer Service""","3319","""Employee commitment in customer service is a critical aspect of any successful business. It encompasses the dedication, motivation, and loyalty that employees display towards their organization, their team, and most importantly, towards providing exceptional service to customers. In a competitive market where customer experience can make or break a company, having committed employees is a key differentiator that can drive customer satisfaction, retention, and ultimately, business success.  One of the fundamental aspects of employee commitment in customer service lies in creating a positive work environment. Employees who feel valued, respected, and supported are more likely to be engaged and committed to their roles. This can be achieved through effective communication from management, recognition of hard work and achievements, providing opportunities for growth and development, and fostering a culture of teamwork and collaboration.  Training and development play a crucial role in enhancing employee commitment in customer service. By investing in continuous training programs, employees can improve their skills, knowledge, and confidence in dealing with customers effectively. This not only benefits the employees by enhancing their capabilities but also boosts their morale and commitment to delivering high-quality service.  Moreover, effective leadership is essential in cultivating employee commitment in customer service. Good leaders inspire, motivate, and align their team towards a common goal of prioritizing customer satisfaction. Leaders should lead by example, demonstrate a customer-centric mindset, and provide guidance and support to their team members to ensure they feel empowered and motivated to go above and beyond for the customers.  Recognition and rewards are powerful motivators that can reinforce employee commitment in customer service. Acknowledging and appreciating employees for their hard work, dedication, and outstanding service can instill a sense of pride and ownership in their roles. Incentives such as bonuses, promotions, or even simple gestures like a 'thank you' can go a long way in boosting morale and reinforcing employee commitment.  Employee engagement also plays a pivotal role in fostering commitment in customer service. Engaged employees are enthusiastic about their work, emotionally invested in the organization, and committed to delivering exceptional service. Regular feedback, open communication channels, and involving employees in decision-making processes can all contribute to higher levels of engagement and subsequently, higher levels of commitment to customer service.  Furthermore, a clear organizational vision and values are essential in aligning employees towards a common purpose. When employees understand how their individual roles contribute to the overall customer service goals of the company, they are more likely to feel connected to the organization's mission and exhibit higher levels of commitment in their customer interactions.  Employee empowerment is another crucial factor that influences commitment in customer service. Empowered employees are given the autonomy and authority to make decisions and take actions that benefit the customers without constant micromanagement. This sense of trust and empowerment leads to increased job satisfaction, motivation, and commitment to delivering exceptional customer service experiences.  In conclusion, employee commitment in customer service is a multifaceted concept that requires a holistic approach encompassing various elements such as a positive work environment, training and development, effective leadership, recognition and rewards, employee engagement, organizational vision and values, and employee empowerment. By prioritizing employee commitment, organizations can create a workforce that is dedicated, motivated, and passionate about delivering outstanding service that exceeds customer expectations, ultimately leading to long-term success and competitive advantage in the market.""","647"
"3023","""Grazia is Britain's first weekly glossy magazine which has recently been launched onto the UK market. It is based on the upmarket Italian Grazia published by the market leading Mondadori Group, from whom Emap has secured a license for the title. In a similar manner to the Italian publication Grazia UK will be targeted at the 'elegant up-market women aged between 5/8 and 5/8'. Its characteristics include the usual 'glossy arra of fashion and lifestyle news accompanied by high-end advertising in the beauty and cosmetic markets' (Media Week, Emap confirms Grazia launch). Grazia's launch in the UK market is bold and innovative and is likely to expand the market bringing something new to readers and advertisers. Emap's partnership with Mondadori Group has guaranteed Grazia UK a favoured position in with the likes of Armani and Prada. Grazia's Target consumer market Grazia has targeted itself to create a niche position in the market as a weekly fashion glossy and needs to succeed to justify Emap's huge investment of 6 their motivations, what they like to spend their money on as well as their spending power and disposable income. It may have also shown the ratio of interest in both fashion and beauty. Their distribution research will have established where the target consumer is likely to shop for the magazine- what is their lifestyle and where are they likely to live. However, a magazine is not an essential purchase. It is a lifestyle product that needs to be where their target consumers are. They will not travel a long way to a specialist outlet on a weekly basis just to buy a product such as this. For promotional research Emap could have used their other established magazines' databases to asses the effect of different forms of media promotion such as television and radio advertising. Product research would have identified the niche product requirement by looking for gaps in the market not being served by the product content of other existing magazines. Some of the secondary research would have been relatively quick and cheap because Emap already has existing successful magazines, which have factual data on what sells magazines. Expert analysis of the data already existing on Emap's companies records would have turned it into usable information; 'raw data in itself worthless unless it is manipulated to answer the right questions' (Blyth, 001). The CompetitionGrazia has been described as a niche on its own with 'an eclectic mix of real-life stories, fashion titbits hottest things of the week and old favourites of travel food and health' (Nicky Noble, Media Week). As the targeted consumer is a more mature, upmarket woman, the competition for Grazia is sparse because many of the weeklies, and also monthlies, are aimed at the average 0-something female interested in celebrities and high street fashion. Grazia's niche positioning 'has fused fashion and beauty editorial of a monthly magazine with the features and pace of a weekly' (Nicky Noble, Media Week). Emap's huge investment of 6 million indicates their determination to succeed by expanding the sector as a whole. However, competition in the women's magazine market is particularly fierce, especially at this time of year. All five main magazine companies are launching a new women's magazine within the first four months of 005/8. The National Magazine Company recently launched 'Reveal' magazine, which is in strong competition with Emap's 'Closer' because they are both a mix of celebrity, lifestyle and television listings. This, however, is no competition for Grazia. Conde Nast's and Northern & Shell's new launches are both in the monthly market, which is more likely to be competition for Grazia. Although a weekly, Grazia is predicted that it will have a bigger impact on the monthly sales market. This prediction is based on the recent impact that the new weekly men's magazines 'Nuts' and 'Zoo' had on the sales of 'FHM' and 'Loaded'. 'The development of men's weeklies had a profound impact on the monthlies' (Media Week, How 005/8 is shaping up as the year of the women reader). Therefore, if Grazia is to follow suit, Conde Nast's 'Easy Living' launch in March is likely to be strong competition for Grazia as it is described as the 'older sister' to Glamour magazine, as well as the targeted consumer is similar to that of Grazia's; 0-9 year olds. Northern and Shell's 'Happy', recently launched in April, may also have competition from Grazia as its market segment is a monthly fashion and beauty title. In this case, it seems that 'Happy' and Grazia are both aimed at fashion and beauty, although one being monthly and the other a weekly begs the question as to which one will be more successful in that particular niche. Marketing mixProduct: The design Grazia has adopted is very distinct. All editions to date have brightly coloured lettering with a distinctive celebrity on the cover. By doing this, they are creating a diverse and instantly recognisable brand that stands out amongst the other competition. Those consumers that become brand loyal to Grazia will, as a result, instantly buy it without browsing its content list. The cover's marketing message is a mix of its weekly content with a new celebrity on the cover each week. This is combined with an extensive celebrity interview inside the magazine as well as articles on the hot buys of the week in accessories, beauty and fashion. The Chief Executive of Emap has already discovered 'there is a very clear understanding about the Grazia brand and how it should be delivered' (Paul Keenan, Media Week). However, the brand is an established Italian one and therefore needs adaptation to fit the British market. The new brand of Grazia for Emap is likely to expand its product portfolio. If, using the a strategic tool such as the Boston Matrix, it establishes that Emap already have profitable 'stars' and 'cash cows' with good sales figures for 'Top Sante' (26,00 copies). These products are either in the Growth or Maturity stages with successful sales and good profit. This, then, allows Emap to 'invest their profit into a new product that is about to enter the introductory stage' (Naylor, 999), this being Grazia. Price: Emap will want to market Grazia as representing good value for money. However, this does not necessarily mean that it needs to be the cheapest available. In fact, it would be counter-productive because the objective is to attract upmarket consumers. The main tenet of their marketing concept will be that most of their customers are prepared to pay a little more for something that works really well for them. If the product is good value, the reader will remain loyal whereas bad pricing will cause the consumer to look elsewhere. Because Grazia is a niche, it is difficult to create a competitive pricing strategy. This is especially true because it seems most of its competition will be monthlies. Emap therefore needed to be careful in establishing that Grazia represents good value. As the current weekly price of. to.0 a month, this means that it is very expensive in comparisons to some other competitors such as 'Glamour' and 'Marie Claire' are only.5/8 and.0 suggesting that they are better value for money. Place: Grazia is currently being sold in most supermarkets and newsagents throughout the UK. When a new magazine is launched, the type of establishment in which it is sold is not an issue but the geographical location of that establishment might be. It will be Emap's responsibility to make the product widely available in all establishments in which the competitive magazines are sold. If Emap has researched correctly and therefore knows where their potential consumers live within the UK, they may target the highest population regions and focus on achieving more outlets in order to generate higher sales. Promotion: Emap has launched a massive 6 million advertising campaign in order to raise awareness of the new product to the right consumer. In television and radio campaigns and on posters and very successful in relation to not be known for a few months. However, according to editor; Jane Bruton stated in Grazia's first issue so far they have created a successful word of mouth 'with queues in some newsagents and even a rumour of a hussle in one well known supermarket' (see appendix). The magazine has also offered readers the opportunity to send letters voicing their opinions on the magazine in order to gage a reaction of their performance. They have also created a Grazia access to consumer's personal details. Evidence of post sales performance advertising did occurred within the first week of its launch as on the 3 rd of February with W H Smith incorporated point of sale material clearly marking 'Grazia as the week's no: mag'. ConclusionWhen Emap carried out their research for Grazia, they would have used both quantitative and qualitative data in order to discover if the niche was strong enough to exploit, achievable through surveys and questionnaires giving the relevant answers and opinions which could then have been analysed appropriately. All companies need a variety of products, which are varying in their product life cycle. 'This theory assumes that changes in the consumer preference go only one way- into decline' (Naylor, 999).Therefore, from the research undergone it seems Grazia will create a successful list and portfolio for Emap. From the analysis of the current market, it seems that there is little competition in the niche Grazia has entered, especially so in the case for the weeklies. This provides evidence that Grazia will inevitably do well. However, the monthlies Glamour and Marie Claire, although aimed at a younger market (around 8-5/8), their price tags of.5/8 and.0 may viewed as much better value. Therefore Grazia must ensure they establish its niche segment to justify its price However, it seems the biggest competitor for Grazia is 'Vogue' magazine, with a content of high priced fashion such as Versace and Giorgio Armani, as well as a mixture of High Street labels including Monsoon and French Connection, creating endless fashion variety. This mixture of Designer and High Street labels is also evident in the beauty sector and 'Vogue' successfully achieves all this in an extensive magazine averaging 00 pages an edition. Nevertheless, 'Vogue', like with any other monthly, has the advantage of loyal subscribers on a yearly basis. With this, they know they will still sell successfully throughout the year. Grazia, like other magazines in the weekly sector fails to attract this subscription but there is the question; would they be able to attract subscribers at an expensive a month? If not then they would need to reconsider their pricing strategy or follow 'Elle's' example of once being a weekly and now a successful monthly..""","""Launch of Grazia magazine in UK""","2208","""Grazia magazine, a renowned name in the world of fashion and lifestyle publications, made its much-anticipated debut in the United Kingdom with a grand launch that sparked a wave of excitement among fashion enthusiasts, trendsetters, and readers alike.

"10","""By 930 Stalin had not only managed to gain extensive personal control and eliminated all his opponents but had also managed to consolidate this power. Accountable to very few Stalin was free to pursue any policy largely unchecked. He had support from the party rank and file as well as from the central committee and the Politburo. How Stalin, the least obvious of Lenin's potential successors, came to be in this position is a much contested issue. With his death Lenin left a vacuum within the party leadership creating economic, social and political uncertainty. This in turn led to a left / right divide within the Politburo over the next steps the Bolsheviks should take, with Trotsky on the left arguing for rapid industrialisation. Stalin maintained a generally moderate position before siding with Kamenev and Zinoviev forming a powerful triumvate against the man they saw as their biggest rival. After Trotsky's eventual expulsion from the party, and then the country, came the political execution of Kamenev and Zinoviev followed by their actual execution. Stalin's other main rivals faded away either in to political destruction, suicide, execution or expulsion. A. Nove and C. Read, Stalin: Terror and Transformations, video. Nove and Read, Stalin: Terror and Transformations, video. R. Hingley, Stalin; Man and Legend, (London, 974), ch7, p. I find it hard to justify putting Stalin's rise to power down to any one single factor. It does not seem possible that Stalin reached his position purely due to his own manipulation or political cunning. Nor does it seem realistic that he was put in power purely because he was the politician that most reflected the party rank and file wishes. A number of reasons seems the most probable explanation; I will argue that the most important are as follows. Stalin proved a useful asset to Lenin and as a result Lenin often supported Stalin's appointments and promotions. The positions Stalin held within the party were of vital importance in helping him gain power, his personality and his political prowess were also very important in this respect. The mistakes of Stalin's rivals during the 920's were to prove fatal and helped him in his ascendancy to power. Many of the opportunities which led to Stalin's rise to power were actually accumulated whilst Lenin was still alive. Infact on many occasions it was Lenin that endorsed Stalin's promotion to important positions within the party. Stalin fitted the proletariat ideal lacking in so many of the profiles of the Bolshevik leaders including Lenin's own, Stalin was singled out by Lenin as having potential. His activities to raise funds for the party included bank robbing, and he was one of those 'hard core' Bolsheviks who had remained in Russia '.underground during the winter 905/8 - repression and persecution of revolutionaries by the Tsar.' This mixture of loyalty and practicality was one Lenin could not resist, he began to rely on Stalin who proved a useful asset. 'He was an unquestioningly loyal person who actually got things done. Stalin was Lenin's political fixer.packing the congress with his supporters'. Lenin supported and approved many of the positions Stalin was appointed to within the party. Although Trotsky claimed that after Stalin's appointment as party General Secretary Lenin expressed concern; '.this cook will serve only peppery dishes', he did not seem sufficiently concerned to raise public objection until very near his death when it was too late. Indeed, prior to his appointment as General Secretary Stalin already held positions of great importance; immediately after the civil war he was Commissar of Nationalities, Commissar of the Workers and Peasants Inspectorate and a member of the Politburo. 'Several of Stalin's crucial promotions - cooption to the central committee and appointment as Pravda editor in 912 and as General Secretary in 922- were brought about by Lenin's influence.' L.

Read, The Making and Breaking of the Soviet System, (Hampshire, 001), p.4. Stalin has been described as 'the spider in the web' in terms of his positioning within both the state and the party apparatus. He had influence within all the main offices, and the posts he held gave him direct authority or at the very least powers of persuasion over a very useful range of contacts. At the time of Lenin's death when the struggle for power was fought out amongst the Politburo members, Stalin had power within the Politburo, (the highest decision making body), the Orgburo, (the administrative bureau of the central committee), the Robkrin and the Sovarkom, as well as in the regional and local party cells and the regional and local soviets. The very nature of the centralised organisation of the party and the state worked to Stalin's advantage due to the links between all the offices. Though all his positions gave him important influence, it was his position as General Secretary which allowed him to build up the kind of power base which defeated his rivals. In this post Stalin was responsible for Politburo administration including the agenda for discussion, Stalin was the link between the Politburo and the Central Committee, he also controlled the '.appointment and promotion of individuals to key posts throughout the country.' As Edward Acton points out, this meant that 'the careers of party officials were becoming increasingly dependent upon their loyalty to the Secretariat.' This in turn gave the '.central administrative organs enormous influence over the make-up of party Congresses and thus of elections to the Central Committee and the Politburo itself'. Acton maintains that this 'movement of power from the Politburo to the Secretariat', was initially '.masked under Lenin's authority over the Secretariat.' However Deutscher claims that on Lenin's return from the recovery of his first stroke he sensed the increasing power of the bureaucracy with Stalin at its head, and immediately rectify the situation. The position of General Secretary had been largely overlooked as a source of power due to its administrative nature; '.the bright sparks of the Politburo felt themselves above such roles.' However Stalin was willing to take on this shunted position, and was good at it; he worked hard, he was reliable, made no fuss and needed little assistance from the other Politburo members. He converted secondary administrative power in to political power, using the powerful self perpetuating nature of the vested interests within the bureaucracy.

Stalin's personality and his political manoeuvring and prowess have been interpreted in a number of ways. As evil, pre-planned, ruthless, manipulation, but also as a highly skilful reaction to economic, social and political situations. Which ever interpretation bears more truth, that Stalin's politics proved enormously valuable to him during the 920's is undoubtable. The moderate position Stalin seemed to take during Politburo meetings both whilst Lenin was alive and after his death allowed him several advantages. It meant that he 'always seemed to follow others, never to direct them', making Trotsky, who was very active during meetings, seem the biggest threat to power. 'No one could have behaved less like a tyrant or dictator than did Stalin at Politburo meetings'. This moderate position also allowed Stalin to remain 'silent during debates.intervening only to support the majority view.giving the impression of one whose will always prevailed in the end.' Although this may be a rather cynical interpretation of Stalin's political stance during meetings, it did allow him the luxury of supporting which ever people he wished because his views were not an open matter. It also kept him from the trap he used against so many of his rivals; that of criticising the now revered Lenin. Stalin had few political inspirations of his own, but by taking the safe and unremarkable route of following Lenin he could undermine enemies. Hingley, Stalin; Man and Legend, (London, 974), ch7, p. Bazhanov's memoirs cited in Hingley, Stalin; Man and Legend, (London, 974), ch7, p. Hingley, Stalin; Man and Legend, (London, 974), ch7, p. By placing himself in the position of Lenin's 'chief mourner', persuading the party to have Lenin's embalmed body on public show, and playing an active role at Lenin's funeral whilst Trotsky was absent, Stalin helped to create a cult around Lenin which he was at the head of. Stalin presented his views as the legacy of Lenin, following his wishes and therefore justified in whatever action he took. Stalin's work to interpret Leninism for the working man, simplifying it and explaining it, helped him present his brand of Leninism as the only one with authenticity. This initiative to enlighten the rank and file of the party was not a solitary one; Stalin seemed to pay attention to the rank and file wishes, as well as understanding how important their support could be. It has often been argued that Stalin's political actions, and some of the apparently contradictory moves he made, closely reflected the views of the rank and file members. The recognition of the importance of lower ranking Bolsheviks gave Stalin the advantage of gaining their support where other potential leaders lacked it. Acton, Russia, The Tsarist and Soviet Legacy, (Essex, 995/8), p.93. Tucker, Stalin as Revolutionary 879 - 929, (London, 974), p.19. Sheila Fitzpatrick, Stalinism; New Directions, (London, 000), p. In terms of the political stealth Stalin demonstrated during the 920's leadership struggle, the battle between Trotsky and Stalin is a revealing example. In particular the contrast between their political styles is interesting; Stalin a more typical politician tentatively weighing up policies and seeking out support; Trotsky a rather superior, aloof character, forthright with his often unpopular views on policy, and expecting support to find him. Stalin seems to have exploited the fears of the other Politburo members that Trotsky remained their biggest threat in terms of personal power. It seems doubtful that his motivations for the alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev were based on anything more than a wish to remove Trotsky from the leadership race. The seeking out of this alliance created a triumvate which proved very powerful against the already unpopular Trotsky, and all under the cover of policy disagreement. With this kind of backing behind him Stalin 'carried battle in to the wider field of the central committee where he could always secure a majority.' Trotsky's potential support was either alienated by his brusque manner, or undermined by Stalin; the committee was reminded that he was a previous Menshevik, and of the many disagreements he had openly had with Lenin. Stalin often used the disagreements and arguments of the past, out of context, as a tool against his rivals. Trotsky was pitched against the Stalin, Zinoviev, and Kamenev majority as the 'other' rather than as a legitimate opponent with a valid argument. Stalin was able to use Lenin's ban on factions to make punishable Trotsky's attempts to argue his case, and at every chance undermined him; however when the committee called for action to be taken against Trotsky, Stalin defended him and bided his time. Infact throughout the battle with Trotsky, Stalin was careful to leave the heavy criticism to Zinoviev and Kamenev, again preserving the image of the moderate amongst the irrational that had proved so useful in the past. Deutscher, Stalin; A Political Biography, (Oxford, 949), p.33. Duranty, Stalin and Co., (London, 949), p. Hingley, Stalin; Man and Legend, (London, 974), ch7, p. Hingley, Stalin; Man and Legend, (London, 974), ch7, p. Hingley, Stalin; Man and Legend, (London, 974), ch7, p. The final factor in Stalin's rise to power involves the mistakes made by Stalin's opponents during this time. Perhaps one of the most important and most fatal mistakes was the underestimation of Stalin by his rivals; this underestimation in turn led on to other mistakes which were to seal the fates of Stalin's opposition. It was underestimation of Stalin as a worthy and threatening rival which led Kamenev and Zinoviev in to an alliance against Trotsky who they viewed as the most potent danger. 'Comrade card index' in his administrative tasks was never identified as a real problem. It was Kamenev and Zinoviev that endorsed Stalin's position as General Secretary despite knowledge of Lenin's uncertainty about the suitability of the capricious Georgian for this post. Whilst Stalin's fate hung in the balance, Zinoviev and Kamenev argued against the public reading of Lenin's testament, in effect saving Stalin from disgrace and investigation into his conduct as General Secretary. Trotsky made several key faults in his battle with Stalin, undermining himself and loosing himself support. He criticised party bureaucracy and the careerists who accompanied it; in effect criticising and threatening the positions of the very people from whom he required support. Stalin's other opponents made mistakes which Stalin with his 'peasant shrewdness' could exploit. The united opposition was such an unconvincing union of the former enemies Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev that it was not only bound to fail, but bound to rouse little support from the party. These men were all politically broken from previous rounds with Stalin, and could provide little protection to any potential supporters from the increasingly ruthless tactics employed by Stalin and his followers. Likewise, the shaky union made between Zinoviev, Kamenev and Bukharin opposing Stalin's policy of rapid industrialisation and collectivisation, was almost inevitably discovered by Stalin and destroyed through utilisation of the ban on factions rule.

To conclude, I have identified four main factors which I have argued played the biggest part in Stalin's rise to power during the 920's. The acceptance and support Stalin received from Lenin played an important part in allowing Stalin the possibility of playing any kind of key position within the party. The positions Stalin held permitted him great influence within a large number of party areas undetected. He was able to build up a support base and eliminate opposition; turning administrative power into political power. Stalin's personal gift at politics gave him an advantage during the uncertainty after Lenin's death. Stalin defeated those he needed to, he was a competent politician and was able to manipulate situations to his advantage in a way his rivals could not. Finally, the mistakes his opposition made, especially their failure to act upon Lenin's wishes to have Stalin removed from his post, and indeed the very uncertainty in which Lenin left the party leadership, allowed Stalin the chances which led to his rise. Read, The Making and Breaking of the Soviet System, (Hampshire, 001), p.2. I have not argued that Stalin was a passive actor during his rise to power in the 920's. He was an active force, using cunning, manipulation, and politics to engineer his position. However, he could not have done this without the other factors I have mentioned in this essay. All of them were important and I do not think Stalin would have emerged as leader of the party if any one was missing.""","""Stalin's rise to power""","3621","""Joseph Stalin is one of the most controversial figures in modern history, known for his ruthless pursuit and consolidation of power in the Soviet Union. His rise to power was marked by strategic political maneuvering, cunning alliances, and brutal tactics that cemented his position as the undisputed leader of the Soviet state. To understand Stalin's rise to power, we must delve into the tumultuous political landscape of early 20th-century Russia, his role within the Bolshevik Party, and the key events that propelled him to the pinnacle of authority.  Stalin was born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili on December 18, 1878, in Gori, Georgia, then part of the Russian Empire. Raised in poverty and hardship, he later adopted the name Stalin, which means """"man of steel"""" in Russian, a moniker reflecting his uncompromising nature and determination. Stalin's early years were marked by a turbulent childhood, with his father's abusive behavior and his mother's unwavering support shaping his complex psyche.  At a young age, Stalin became involved in revolutionary activities, inspired by the Marxist ideology that advocated for the overthrow of the ruling class and the establishment of a classless society. His revolutionary zeal led him to join the Social Democratic Party, a precursor to the Bolshevik Party founded by Vladimir Lenin. Stalin quickly rose through the party ranks, showcasing his organizational skills and unwavering loyalty to Lenin's vision of a socialist revolution.  The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 marked a turning point in Stalin's political career. As Lenin and his followers seized power from the Provisional Government, Stalin played a crucial role in key decisions and military strategies that secured the Bolsheviks' grip on power. His contributions to the Red Army's victory in the Russian Civil War further solidified his standing within the party hierarchy, earning him Lenin's trust and admiration.  Despite his growing influence, Stalin faced rivals within the Bolshevik leadership, notably Leon Trotsky, a charismatic and influential figure who posed a threat to Stalin's ambitions. In the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin skillfully outmaneuvered his opponents, utilizing his position as General Secretary of the Communist Party to consolidate power and eliminate dissent. Through a combination of political maneuvering, propaganda, and coercion, Stalin emerged victorious, sidelining Trotsky and other rivals through a campaign of purges and repressions.  Stalin's rise to power was marked by the implementation of a totalitarian regime characterized by fear, censorship, and state violence. The Great Purge of the late 1930s stands as a dark chapter in Soviet history, during which Stalin orchestrated a ruthless campaign to eliminate perceived enemies of the state, real or imagined. Millions of people were arrested, tortured, and executed or sent to labor camps, their fates sealed by Stalin's paranoia and ruthless quest for control.  Stalin's cult of personality reached its peak during the height of his power, with propaganda portraying him as a wise and infallible leader, the embodiment of the Soviet Union's greatness. His policies, including rapid industrialization through Five-Year Plans and collectivization of agriculture, transformed the Soviet economy but came at a tremendous human cost, with millions of lives lost due to famine, forced labor, and state-sanctioned violence.  In conclusion, Joseph Stalin's rise to power was a complex and ruthless journey marked by ambition, cunning, and a willingness to resort to extreme measures to achieve his goals. From his humble beginnings as a revolutionary agitator to his iron-fisted rule as the Soviet dictator, Stalin's legacy is one of immense suffering and tragedy. By examining the key events and decisions that shaped his ascent to power, we gain insight into the dark realities of totalitarianism and the destructive impact of unchecked authoritarianism on society.""","764"

The fact that large-bodied species tend to have decreased rates of reproductive output and increased inter-birth intervals exacerbates the effects that hunting has on to be more resilient to hunting than the other guenons with which it shares the forest, as it is more cryptic in colour and smaller in body the dwarf the only lemur species not affected by local hunting. Some Cercopithecine species will purposely reduce alarm calls and hide in thick bush in response to human encounters in order to be more the pressures of hunting in Jodhpur where they are thought to be hunted because they were thought to share too many similarities with faces the greatest threat of extinction, existing in only a small area around the Uganda, Rwanda, Zaire border, with just four hundred to six hundred individuals Havea habitats as result of the rubber tappers hunting them for food while working in the, species existing in small unstable populations stand a high chance of becoming extinct. The ability of a primate species to adapt to a new environment will strongly influence to what degree habitat degradation intensifies the effects of hunting pressure on that species. Primates such as red colobus monkeys and chimpanzees prefer old-growth forest areas and so are less able to adapt to habitat change and thus are more vulnerable to to the loss of some species from certain areas altogether. This can be fatal for primates in need of conservation. For example, it has been reported that pest control in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest in Kenya, is occurring at a level beyond the sustainable extraction rate for both the blue the yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) (Fitzgibbon, Mogaka and Fanshawe, 995/8). In addition primate species that humans feel threatened by may be specifically targeted and hunted to such a degree that extinction becomes plausible. This has been witnessed in Africa where gorillas believed to be responsible for taking human babies have been actively hunted (Dunbar and Barrett, 000). Conclusion From the examples discussed in this paper it appears obvious that a range of factors play a part in deciding the fate of primate populations across the globe. During the 9 th Congress of the International Primate Society in Bejing, China, in 002 it was decidedly agreed that primates are under threat of extinction mainly as a result of rapid habitat loss and exploitation for food and body parts by humans (National Geographic, 002). Indeed Leakey and Lewin predicted more than seven years ago that: 'if unchecked human activities will continue to result in an upset balance of species interactions of altered ecosystems and extensive habitat and species loss.' Hunting at a sustainable level may prove to be an effective conservation strategy for many species. However, recent reports suggest that current sustainable rates of harvesting gorillas and chimpanzees may be just % and % respectively (Peterson and Ammann, 003). Therefore for primates, sustainable hunting may not be a realistic option. As a result of the diminishing natural environment it has been calculated that further losses in primate diversity could occur as soon as within the next twenty to fifty years (Kudla, Wilson and Wilson, 997; Struhsaker, 997). If predictions are accurate, large, highly conspicuous, specialized, terrestrial primate species inhabiting areas prone to habitat degradation are most likely to be lost first. While religious, cultural and traditional beliefs protect certain species from hunting pressures, people's personal views and attitudes towards primates will, in addition, shape the future of their communities. Throughout history humankind has decidedly influenced the diversity and distribution of primate species and will continue to do so for as long as the two co-exist. Ultimately it is the rate at which the human population continues to grow, combined with species-specific resilience to anthropogenic pressures that will decide the future of remaining primate populations.""","""Primate extinction and conservation challenges""","970","""Primates, the order of mammals that includes humans, apes, monkeys, and prosimians, face a stark reality of extinction due to various factors that threaten their survival. From deforestation and habitat loss to illegal wildlife trade and climate change, primates around the world are under immense pressure, leading to a concerning decline in their populations. The extinction of primates not only represents a loss of biodiversity but also a threat to ecosystems and the delicate balance of nature. Conservation efforts play a crucial role in combating these challenges, striving to protect primates and their habitats for future generations.  One of the primary drivers of primate extinction is habitat destruction. Deforestation for agriculture, mining, logging, and infrastructure development leads to the fragmentation and loss of primate habitats. As these habitats shrink, primates are forced into smaller areas, increasing competition for resources and making them more vulnerable to threats such as poaching and human-wildlife conflict. Conservationists work to address this by establishing protected areas, promoting sustainable land-use practices, and engaging with local communities to ensure the coexistence of humans and primates.  Illegal wildlife trade poses another significant threat to primate populations. Primates are often targeted for bushmeat, traditional medicine, pets, and even entertainment purposes. The demand for primate parts and live animals drives poaching and trafficking activities, further endangering already vulnerable species. Conservation organizations collaborate with law enforcement agencies to combat wildlife crime, strengthen regulations, and raise awareness about the consequences of this illegal trade on primate populations and ecosystems.  Climate change adds another layer of complexity to the challenges facing primate conservation. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events impact primate habitats, food sources, and overall well-being. Species that are already threatened by other factors may lack the resilience to adapt to rapid environmental changes, putting them at a higher risk of extinction. Conservation efforts focus on mitigating the effects of climate change through habitat restoration, reforestation projects, and sustainable conservation practices that promote ecosystem health and resilience.  Beyond these external threats, primates also face intrinsic challenges that affect their survival. Factors such as disease outbreaks, genetic bottlenecks, and limited genetic diversity can weaken populations and make them more susceptible to extinction. Conservation genetics plays a critical role in understanding the genetic health of primate populations, identifying key populations for conservation efforts, and implementing strategies such as genetic rescue to increase genetic diversity and population resilience.  Engaging local communities and stakeholders is essential for the success of primate conservation initiatives. Human activities are often at the root of the threats facing primates, and sustainable conservation solutions must consider the needs and perspectives of those who live in close proximity to primate habitats. Community-based conservation projects that involve local people in decision-making, sustainable livelihood development, and environmental education help foster a sense of ownership and stewardship towards primates and their habitats.  Education and outreach are key components of raising awareness about the importance of primate conservation. By involving schools, universities, media, and the general public, conservation organizations can promote empathy towards primates, inspire action to protect them, and build a global movement for conservation. Encouraging responsible tourism practices that prioritize the well-being of primates and their habitats can also contribute to sustainable conservation funding and support local economies.  In conclusion, primate extinction is a pressing issue that requires concerted efforts from governments, conservation organizations, local communities, and individuals worldwide. By addressing the underlying drivers of extinction, implementing effective conservation strategies, and fostering a culture of coexistence with primates, we can work towards a future where these remarkable creatures thrive in their natural habitats. Together, we have the power to make a difference and ensure the survival of primates for generations to come.""","745"
"431",""".What a person is or can be, and does or can do is essentially a function of human well being, within which the factor of indisputable importance would be health. As Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen argues that the 'capability to function' is what really matters for a poor or non poor person, drawing on whom the United Nations 994 Human Development Report asserts the purpose of development as being able to create an environment in which all people can expand their capabilities, and opportunities can be enlarged for both current and future generations. This explains why countries with high levels of income but poor standards of health and education have been referred to as cases of 'growth without development'. Unprecedented advances in human capital have taken place in the last half-century, in both developed and developing countries. The purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between health and economic development through a cross-national empirical analysis by estimating the determinants of health and emphasising on the impact of income and education on the state of health. However the paper is not successful in finding a reverse causality for both these relationships, though studies do show that healthier people earn higher wages due to productivity differences thereby increasing utility by increasing income and raising the return to the economy. Ambiguity with regard to its causal relation with education still holds in reality. In section the paper reviews and discusses plausible findings of prominent economists in this area. Section presents the methodology undertaken for the study, the econometric techniques used for estimating the model and also describes the data. Section provides the empirical results, its analysis and implications. In section the paper concludes with summary of the results, extensions to further study along with suggestions for government policy making.. Literature ReviewThe study of health has been of immense economic, political and social importance.

However for cross country analysis, there are two kinds of data which are frequently used, life expectancy and mortality rate. Life expectancy has wider thus is more appropriate and shall be used in this the average literacy used as dependent variables. The data has primarily been obtained from World Development Indicators, the World Bank database. Few of the variables for which data was obtained from the United Nations Statistics. All data was accessible through the Economic and Social Data Service International website. Although the databases contained data for over 00 adjustments for missing observations, the sample size reduced considerably. The regressions are based on data averaging over 0 years from 995/8 to 004. It is extremely costly and time consuming to obtain social indicators, which explains their scarcity. Some of the indicators are collected only once in every couple of years, also due to the fact that these do not change much within a year. Thus taking averages reduces measurement error at the same time enables one to get maximum data. The presence of heteroskedasticity is tested using the pure form White Test for Heteroskedasticity with cross terms, wherever possible. If the null for no rejected at the 0% level of significance, heteroskedasticity is a the White's Heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors and used as a remedial the presence of outliers of influential for normality which tests the joint hypothesis of the skewness and kurtosis equal to and respectively. If the p value of the JB statistic is sufficiently high and the hypothesis is not rejected, the residuals are normally distributed. Ideally the JB statistic should be used for large sample sizes. To test how good the fitted model is, besides using the above mentioned tests, certain basic criteria are used. Whether the signs of the estimated coefficients are in accordance with prior expectations; whether the relationship is statistically the explanatory power of the discussed. Before the interpretation of these results the statistical tests that need to be performed, on the estimated OLS and its residuals, their reasons and implications are summarized in the table below. The E-views5/8 econometrics software has been used to perform the appropriate tests. All detailed test results are provided in the appendix. The summarised results and empirical implications are given in the following section.. Results and Empirical ImplicationsDeterminants of HealthHealth conditions are determined by factors such as the level of income, education and other health inputs. Table summarizes these findings using life expectancy as the indicator of health status. Both economic growth and education are found to play an extremely significant role in explaining the state of health. Note: The OLS estimation method with the White Heteroskedasticity-Consistent Standard Errors & Covariance is used for and the OLS estimator is applied to . For notations see previous section. Standard errors are given in parentheses. significant at the 0% level, significant at the % level, significant at the % level All equations illustrate the strong positive relation between life expectancy and GDP per capita, which is found to be significant even at the % level. that a percentage change in GDP per capita increases life expectancy at birth by about.7 years. Education measured by the literacy rate shows a positive impact on the state of health, especially in where it is significant at the % level, increasing life expectancy by.7 and.0 years respectively for a unit increase in the literacy rate. In it is only significant at the 0% level. The number of physicians per thousand also play a positive and highly significant role, increasing life expectancy by about years for an additional physician per thousand. These three indicators together account for almost 7% of the variation in life expectancy as a measure of health as shown by the R of.7 in a p value of.45/8 which means that the null hypothesis for homoskedasticity is rejected and the usual OLS t-statistics can no longer be used, thus the OLS standard errors and variances are replaced by heteroskedasticity robust ones. access to safe drinking water as an explanatory variable along with GDP per capita and the literacy rate and is found to be statistically significant at the % level contributing to.9 additional years of life expectancy for a unit increase in percentage of population with access to safe water resources. It is also highly significant for equations estimated in . The White test in be rejected with a p value of.1 therefore heteroskedaticity is not a problem and the usual OLS standard errors are used. With similar reasoning the null for homoskedasticity is not rejected for and rejected for for which heteroskedasticity robust errors are used. For White's test was used with no cross terms as the variable gini had insufficient observations for it to be calculated. In the subsequent equation the variable was dropped and heteroskedasticity was indeed found to be a problem using the pure form of the test with cross terms, which has been used for all remaining equations as well. test for the significance of immunisation against DPT and measles turn out to be significant even at the % level increasing life expectancy by.3 years with a unit increase in the percentage of vaccinations against DPT and.5/8 years in case of measles. However literacy remains insignificant even at the 0% level in both regressions. The R increases to about.3 in each case. The intercept is highly significant for the % level, showing the average life expectancy would to be as low as 1 years in the absence of these three variables. an extremely important determinant of health other than GDP per capita, literacy, and access to safe water all three of which are significant at the % level, namely the HIV prevalence rate which is responsible for reducing life about. years for a unit increase in the rate of HIV prevalence. The explanatory power of the model immediately increases to about 8%. In a number of explanatory variables are newly included to indicate health status. They are the urban population of a country, access to sanitation facilities, smoking prevalence rates, the gini index as a measure of inequality, and the expenditures on health by the government, both equations find GDP per capita, literacy, safe water, HIV, as highly significant either at the % or % levels. The intercept in found to be significant at the % level indicating life expectancy to be around 6 years in the absence of all other variables. After dropping the gini index variable in expenditure becomes significant at the 0% level. The explanatory power of the model is extremely good with an R of about.1 in both cases. However quite a few of the new explanatory variables like urban population, sanitation, the gini index which have insignificant t-statistics and do not turn out to be as significant as anticipated. Thus with such a high R and insignificant t-statistics the problem of multicollinearity is suspected. However multicollinearity is essentially a data deficiency problem. Dropping a variable may lead to a specification bias. Other remedial measures could be ridge regression. The basic solution would be to increase the sample size, as in this particular case data infact was deficient in terms of its scarcity for some particular variables like smoking prevalence, the gini index and few others. Also the problem of outliers and random samples are not ruled out. In the data which was missing there could have been some variables which would particularly be influential. Also the data for developing countries for which the analysis should hold even more strongly by intuition, is even harder to get and is absent for a lot of countries. However, the each of the regressions is jointly significant, indicated by a p value of zero for the F- statistic for all seven equations. Few further statistical tests are conducted on its residuals. The test results are summarised in table. Detailed test statistics for each test are given in the appendix. Thus, even though the variables urbnpop, sanit, smkng, gini and hlthexp are insignificant individually, indicated by their t-statistics, jointly they are extremely significant as shown by the Wald test. Both the Ramsey Reset test for the correct functional form as well as the test for normality show that the correct functional form has been the residuals are normally distributed which makes the model a valid one. The analysis shows that economic growth plays a highly crucial role in the state of health for a nation. Income provides food for survival, access to medical services and a basic standard of living. Education provides the knowledge and understanding of basic nutrition, sanitation and hygiene along with creating awareness regarding certain health programmes and preventive measures of diseases. In addition to these factors well developed health infrastructure like accessibility to safe water, number of hospitals/physicians, immunisations so on are indispensable. Economic Growth and HealthNext the causal relation between health and economic growth is tested. The growth rate of GDP per capita is used as the dependant variable to indicate economic development and the explanatory GDP per capita in 995/8 viewed as initial income to indicate conditional the initial level of GDP to be negatively associated with growth rate which complies with the conditional convergence theory. Investment however is only significant at the 3% level. Population too enters with a negative sign as an increase in population leads to a decline in shared income by.6 per unit. The labour force too is significant at the 0% level and has a positive impact on the growth rate, this also captures the indirect effect of health which is responsible for the productivity of the labour force. However it is unfortunate to find that the model does not predict the positive effect of education and health significantly. The summary of further statistical tests conducted for given in table which indicates that there are several problems with the model. The White's Test indicates that heteroskedasticity is a problem, the null for homoskedasticity being rejected at the % level of significance and the robust standard errors have been used to correct for heteroskedasticity. However, the Ramsey Reset test rejects the null which means that there is a misspecification of the model in its functional form. As a remedial measure the log of gdpg i.e. the dependent variable is taken after which the p value for the Reset test increases to.89 and therefore the null is no longer rejected, however the test statistics for health and education still remain insignificant and therefore have not been reported found a strong positive relation between the two variables in most cases, therefore the possibility of an insignificant relation in not inevitable. Also the impact is highly sensitive to the underlying behavioural assumptions and the nature of unobserved variables. Effect of certain unobservables like innate ability, motivation, genetic endowment, capacity to concentrate, household intellectual atmosphere, parental time devoted to cognitive development of child, effectiveness of school management and so on have to be kept in mind. The model does have an explanatory power of about 0%. Further statistical tests carried out for summarised in table.The model is homoskedastic, has the correct functional form and though the normality assumption holds at the % level of significance, it no longer holds at the 0% level. However the model does not really have a large sample for which the normality test is more crucial. All detail test statistics are provided in the appendix.. ConclusionThe empirical analysis in this paper suggests that health conditions for a sample of both developed and developing countries, are explained primarily by the level of income of a country, its educational attainment, health inputs such as safe drinking water, the number of physicians, immunisation rates, health expenditure and the deadly human immunodeficiency virus(HIV). The model showing the causal relation of health with economic growth is quite erroneous and only goes to provide limiting reliance on the cross-sectional work, at the same time it emphasises the need for improving the quality of data and reduce the missing observations, which would solve a lot of problems. In a nutshell data constraints do cripple the analysis severely. The final model does resemble earlier findings where the relation between health and education holds one way or has shown conflicting results for different countries. Another drawback is the inability to control for unobserved variables which bias the estimates. Instruments for these need to be chosen very carefully so as not to create a bias. Extensions to this study could firstly include the use of better data in correcting the drawbacks of the model. Also a country or region specific analysis especially for developing nations would be worthwhile. A point of mention is that all these variables are even more important for developing countries where the basic levels of health and education are yet to be attained and thus even necessary provisions for a minimal level of subsistence like daily food consumption is directly influenced by the level of income. Also the income distribution in these countries show highly skewed patterns with the top 0% of the population receiving to 0 times the income of the bottom 0%. Literacy rates remain strikingly low at 5/8% among the least developed countries and infant mortality rates run as high as 0 times those in developed nations. Life expectancy in 998 still averaged only 8 years in the least developed nations compared to 3 years for other developing countries and 5/8 years for developed countries. In Asia and Africa over 0% of the population barely met minimum caloric requirements necessary to maintain adequate health. For the year 001 certain human deprivation indices show that almost a billion people in poor countries were without access to safe drinking water, 66 million did not have access to health services and. billion lived without sanitation facilities. In 995/8, the number of physicians per 00,00 people averaged only. in least developed countries compared to 17 in developed countries. 0% of the people inflicted with HIV in the world, live in LDCs. By the year 010 life expectancy in Namibia for instance, is expected to fall from 0. years without AIDS to 8. years with AIDS. This is only a brief insight to the myriad of problems which need to be tackled in the world today. It is true that cross sectional data may over or underestimate true causal effects. Moreover prior studies based on past data may show different effects due to different incentives, shocks that might have hit the economy at the time and new market developments and reforms that must have come about making it slightly less comparable. However, there are better studies to suggest to the policy makers the grave importance of improving health standards for economic development. The relation between health and economic development can create either a vicious or a virtuous cycle. There is a debate over whether or not the government should subsidise health and education, however everyone should get an equal go at life at least at the subsistence level in their initial years so that they can translate it into long term productivity gains. The provision of credit for microenterprises is an important poverty alleviation strategy where the credit can contribute to improvement in the nutrition of the poor. Other policy options are providing cash transfers to poor families, family clinic visits, other nutritional and health benefit in kind and so on. Another very important aspect is the dissemination of information and creating awareness among the population especially in rural areas of developing countries which are plagued with myriad social problems. However the picture is not all bleak, greater proportion of the government budgets are being devoted towards human capital, there is a trend towards international convergence in measures of health and education, with unprecedented advances having taken place in the last half of the century. Gross school enrolment rates, teacher pupil ratios, life expectancy have all shown increases which are statistically significant. Improvements have been faster in developing countries, though the gap with developed countries still remains large.""","""Health and Economic Development""","3869","""Health and Economic Development  Health and economic development are intricately linked aspects that play a crucial role in shaping the well-being and prosperity of individuals, communities, and nations at large. The relationship between health and economic development is a complex and multifaceted one, with each aspect influencing and impacting the other in significant ways. In this discussion, we will delve into the interconnectedness of health and economic development, exploring how improvements in health can drive economic growth, and conversely, how economic development can have a profound impact on health outcomes.  First and foremost, it is essential to recognize that good health is not just a fundamental human right but also a critical determinant of one's quality of life. Access to healthcare services, clean water, sanitation, nutrition, and education are all essential components that contribute to good health outcomes. When individuals are healthy and productive, they are more likely to actively participate in the workforce and contribute to economic activities. As such, investments in healthcare systems and preventive health measures can yield substantial returns in terms of economic growth and development.  From an economic perspective, a healthy population forms the backbone of a productive workforce. Reduced mortality rates, lower incidence of diseases, and improved overall well-being contribute to a more robust and efficient labor force. Healthy individuals are not only more productive but also incur lower healthcare costs, reducing the burden on public healthcare systems and freeing up resources for other developmental initiatives. In this sense, health can be viewed as a form of human capital that drives economic productivity and sustainable development.  Conversely, economic development plays a pivotal role in determining the health outcomes of a population. Increased income levels, improved infrastructure, access to education, and better living standards are all factors associated with economic development that can positively impact health indicators. Economic growth facilitates investments in healthcare infrastructure, medical research, disease prevention programs, and access to essential medicines, all of which contribute to improved health outcomes and increased life expectancy.  Moreover, economic development is closely linked to social determinants of health, such as access to safe housing, employment opportunities, social support systems, and environmental conditions. Addressing disparities in income, education, and access to resources can have a profound impact on reducing health inequalities and improving overall population health. By promoting inclusive economic growth and equitable distribution of resources, societies can create an environment that nurtures better health outcomes for all individuals.  Furthermore, the relationship between health and economic development extends beyond the individual level to impact broader societal and global dynamics. Healthy populations are more resilient to economic shocks, natural disasters, and pandemics, safeguarding societal stability and continuity. The COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, starkly highlighted the interdependence of health and economic systems, underscoring the importance of preparedness, healthcare infrastructure, and global cooperation in addressing health crises with far-reaching economic implications.  In the context of global development, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasize the interconnected nature of health and economic well-being. Goal 3 focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages, while Goal 8 aims to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. These goals underscore the importance of addressing health and economic development in tandem to achieve holistic and inclusive progress.  In conclusion, the relationship between health and economic development is a symbiotic one, with each influencing and shaping the other in profound ways. Investing in healthcare, disease prevention, and health promotion not only improves individual well-being but also contributes to economic growth and societal advancement. Likewise, promoting economic development through sustainable practices, equitable policies, and social inclusion can have a transformative impact on health outcomes and overall quality of life. By recognizing and fostering the synergies between health and economic development, societies can pave the way for a more prosperous, resilient, and healthy future for generations to come.""","767"
"347","""The eye is a multi-functional complex tool, that has taken years to understand. Many subsystems such as the lacrimal apparatus have been developed to ensure smooth, efficient use of this body part. Suffice to say, each part had been studied by researchers into extent, which helps us to diagnose, and now treat, many debilitating disorders. On a reasonably small scale, myopia and hyperopia can be corrected easily with glasses, but this has taken a step further with the introduction of laser eye surgery. Corneal implants can restore sight in patients whose cornea have clouded, likewise, lens replacements can provide a cure for cataracts, a symptom of old age, alcoholism and diabetes. The most interesting development will be artificial impulse creation, that could enable completely blind and partially sighted individuals to have some sight stimulation. This implant will improve the qualities of lives of countless individuals, and so it is important to further understanding of the optic nerve system, and conversion of these signals to produce an image, within the occipital lobe of the brain..Vision is a sense that is regarded to be highly valuable. From an early age, children are taught that the human experiences five senses: Touch; Taste; Smell; Sound and Sight. So it is no wonder that it is a subject that attracts much research for development. It is largely appreciated that the human eye is a complex organ, however, with any structure such as this, irregularities and imperfections can occur. The most frequently seen of these are myopia and hyperopia: short-sightedness and long-sightedness. This overview will look at the systems involved with the eye, the issues involved with vision correction, and how it can be hoped for research to develop in the future, so that more people can be given the gift of sight.. The Eye I will begin my discussion with a basic anatomy of the eye. Fig.. indicates the main areas that are of importance when regarding the eye systems. URL Each has specific function that helps to maintain the eye. A brief indication of these would be: URL The Lens bends the light entering the eye so that it forms an image on the retina at the back of the eye. The lens can change shape because it is held in position by the ciliary body. The Cornea is a transparent membrane that covers the iris and pupil. It helps to focus the light. The pupil is the dark hole in the centre of the iris. The iris is the coloured circular part of the eye. It changes the size of the pupil to allow varying amounts of light to enter the eye. The retina is at the back of the eye, and contains many receptor cells to sense the light. This sends a signal along the optic nerve to the brain. The macula is the area that controls our main line of sight. At the centre of it is the fovea, which is where the highest concentration of cells are, in order that we can see in detail. The sclera is the white part of the eye, which is made up of collagen fibres, and supports the structure. The vitreous humour maintains the pressure within the eye, so that the structure is supported. The choroid is a highly capillarised layer, which supplies blood to the retina and the sensory cells. The optic nerve carries the impulses to the brain to analyse the image. To follow on from this brief summary, each area of the eye will be discussed individually, in order that the system may be understood.. The Eyelids and Lacrimal Apparatus The eyelids, or palpebrae, shade the eye during sleep, and prevents foreign objects entering the eye, that could interfere or damage the surface. They also spread lubricating secretions across the surface of the eyeball, that are produced in the lacrimal apparatus, found below the eyebrow. Fig.. represents where this occurs. URL This is the system that produces and clears tears, which contain salts, mucus and lysozyme, a bactericidal enzyme. This lacrimal fluid cleans and lubricates the eyeball. To the eyelids are attached eyelashes, tiny hairs that help to prevent dirt getting into the eye, and shade the eyes, to some extent, from bright light that could damage the internal structures. So as can been seen, the eye is a heavily protected organ, even superficially, which makes it very difficult to analyse any maladies that can occur, because there are so many items to consider. It may be noted that strong emotions of happiness or sadness can be expressed by the production of tears, and this is because the glands are parasympathetically stimulated to overproduce fluid, that cannot flow away quickly enough, this is what 'crying' is, and is unique to humans, although it is unsure as to why this has evolved to be such.. The Iris and Genetics of Eye Colour The iris is the coloured section of the eye, that controls the amount of light allowed into the eye through the pupil. It is made from circular and radial muscles, that are, in normal light, relaxed. However, in bright light, the pupil narrows due to the circular muscles contracting, as part of the parasympathetic nerve system response. The opposite happens in dim light, whereby the radial muscles contract, due to stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. This reaction can be useful to medics, to assess levels of consciousness in casualties. For example, a person with a head injury may have concussion if their pupils do not respond to light, and they are said to be 'fixed and dilated'. It can also be an indicator of brain stem injury in coma patients, because this response is one of the last levels of consciousness to disappear. The colour of the iris is determined by pigments predetermined by genetics. The brown gene is dominant, which means that the probabilities of offspring's eye colour can be calculated as in Fig.. URL Of course, alternative colours to blue and brown do occur, but the brown/blue comparison is more competitive than the other colours, so it provides a better example of dominance.. Extrinsic Eye MusclesThe movements of the eye are controlled by the extrinsic eye muscles. They can also be known as the extraocular muscles, and determine the 'gaze direction' of the eye. This is a simple system of muscles attached to the sclera of the eyeball, that pull the sides of the eye when reacting to brain signals. There are six types of muscle that move the eye in each direction, as can be seen in Fig..: URL URL medial the eye toward the noselateral the eye away from the nosesuperior moves the eye upward and secondarily rotates the top of the eye toward the noseinferior moves the eye downward and secondarily rotates the top of the eye away from the nosesuperior rotates the top of the eye toward the nose and secondarily moves the eye downwardinferior rotates the top of the eye away from the nose and secondarily moves the eye upward Which means that various 'gazes' can be produced, as seen in Fig.. URL In patients where the eyes do not look in the same direction as eachother, there is a fault in the length of the muscles that control the eye movement. This can be fairly easily corrected by surgery, either at birth, or even later on in life, depending on the individual's personal wishes.. The the most frequently transplanted organ. It covers the surface of the eye, and helps to focus the light before entering the lens. Antibodies in the blood cannot reject it, so it usually produces a very successful transplant. A cornea must sometimes be replaced if it has been damaged by cataract operations, or due to chemical burns, but can also degenerate if the sufferer catches viral infections such as herpes simplex. URL Due to lack of donors for cornea transplants, sythetic corneas have recently been developed, which work equally as well as a biological replacement, which is excellent news because corneal disturbances can sometimes cause complete blindness,. The LensThe lens is one of the key structures that make it possible to see. It is held in position behind the cornea by suspensory ligaments, that are attached to the ciliary muscles. These muscles relax and contract to shorten or elongate the lens, so that the image can be focussed most appropriately. The principle idea is that light enters the eye from a distant object, and then is curved by the lens and projected onto the retina at the back of the eye. It can be demonstrated by use of a glass lens in Fig.. URL However, within the eye, this is more complicated because the focal point occurs in the middle of the eye, which means that the image forms on the retina upside-down. The brain has become adapted to analysing this image and correcting it. Experiments have taken place where candidates agreed to wear glasses that flipped the image, so that they saw everything upside-down, but after about a week, the brain would cotton onto this, and correct the image, so that if they took off the glasses, their normal sight would return to the upside-down state. This shows an interesting ability for the brain to make adaptations. However, some things cannot be resolved, such as that absorb middle-wavelength that absorb short-wavelength gives rise to the occurrence of colour blindness. Colour blindness is a condition that affects a small percentage of the population, and is associated with which versions of the cone cells are present in the fovea. Some individuals do not have all types, and therefore it is difficult for them to determine differences between certain colours. Tests such as those in Fig.., can be performed to determine this defect URL. The Sensory ConnectionsThe signal to send via the optic nerve is produced when, within the rod or cone cell, the chemical 1-cis-retinal is stimulated to break down to all-trans-retinal, which happens when the light causes a threshold within the plasma membrane to be breached. This causes a release of ATP from the mitcochondria, where packages are sent through the synaptic terminal. This terminal is connected to a bipolar cell, which connects to ganglion cells and sends the signal to the optic nerve, which takes the signal to the brain to be translated at the visual association area, within the occipital lobe. Fig. 1. The Fovea and Nerve connection structure. The Future for Eye SurgeryA recent boom has taken place in popularity of laser eye surgery. Its aim is to reduce dependence upon use of contact lenses and glasses. In the surgery, the actual procedure is to remove some corneal tissue, which alters the shape of the light entering the eye, so that it becomes easier to focus the light on the retina. Unfortunately, this process still has long healing times, but most often is very successful in creating a vast improvement in sight, of sufferers with myopia and hyperopia. The use of prosthetic lens replacement is being developed by researchers, which would aim to completely remove a distorted lens, and insert a polymer-based material instead. This is due to the repetition of failures in lens transplants. A biological lens does not last for long after the donor has deceased, which means that it is not a viable option. An interesting field has opened up, into the possibility of artificial impulse creation in subjects that have complete loss of sight. This would involve an implant being attached to the visual association area in the brain, which would have the input of a camera, and its output into the brain would be impulses mimicking those that would have been sent, if the eye was functioning correctly. Some prototypes have been made, but it will be a fair few years until this technology is in circulation.. Discussion and Conclusion The eye is a multi-functional complex tool, that has taken years to understand. Many subsystems such as the lacrimal apparatus have been developed to ensure smooth, efficient use of this body part. Suffice to say, each part had been studied by researchers into extent, which helps us to diagnose, and now treat, many debilitating disorders.

Its structure is intricately designed to capture and process visual information from the external environment. Understanding the anatomy of the eye is crucial for comprehending the various vision problems that can arise and the corresponding methods of vision correction available to us.  The eye can be likened to a camera, with its various components working together to focus light onto the retina at the back of the eye, where the images are then converted into electrical signals for interpretation by the brain. The main parts of the eye include the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina, and optic nerve.  The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer layer that acts as the eye's primary lens, bending and focusing light onto the retina. The iris is the colored part of the eye that controls the size of the pupil, which is the black opening in the center of the iris that regulates the amount of light entering the eye. Behind the pupil lies the lens, which further refines the focus of light onto the retina.  The retina is a thin layer of tissue containing millions of light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors. These cells, known as rods and cones, are responsible for converting light into electrical signals that are transmitted via the optic nerve to the brain for visual processing.  Vision correction becomes necessary when the eye's natural ability to focus light is impaired, resulting in common refractive errors such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age-related difficulty in focusing up close). Various treatment options are available to address these issues, ranging from eyeglasses and contact lenses to surgical procedures like LASIK and PRK.  Eyeglasses are a popular and non-invasive method of vision correction that involves lenses designed to compensate for the specific refractive error of the eye. Lenses can be convex or concave to correct nearsightedness or farsightedness, respectively. Bifocal or multifocal lenses are often prescribed for individuals with presbyopia to address both distance and near vision needs.  Contact lenses are another common alternative to eyeglasses, offering improved peripheral vision and freedom from glasses. Contact lenses come in various types, including soft lenses, rigid gas-permeable lenses, and specialty lenses for specific eye conditions. Correctly fitted and properly maintained contact lenses are essential for eye health and optimal vision correction.  Refractive surgeries like LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis) and PRK (Photorefractive Keratectomy) are surgical procedures that reshape the cornea to correct refractive errors. LASIK involves creating a thin flap in the cornea, reshaping the underlying tissue with a laser, and repositioning the flap, while PRK involves removing the outer layer of the cornea before reshaping it with a laser. These surgeries offer the potential for long-term vision correction and reduced dependence on corrective eyewear.  For individuals with more complex refractive errors or thin corneas unsuitable for traditional methods, implantable lenses or phakic intraocular lenses (IOLs) may be recommended. These lenses are surgically implanted inside the eye to correct refractive errors and can provide clear vision without the need for glasses or contact lenses.  In addition to refractive errors, other common vision problems include cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. Cataracts occur when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, leading to blurred vision. Surgical removal of the cataract and replacement with an artificial lens can restore clear vision.  Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, often due to increased pressure within the eye. Treatment for glaucoma typically involves medications, laser therapy, or surgery to lower intraocular pressure and prevent further vision loss.  Macular degeneration is a progressive condition affecting the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. Treatment may include nutritional supplements, injections, or laser therapy to slow the progression of the disease and preserve remaining vision.  Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes-related eye condition caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision loss if left untreated. Managing blood sugar levels, regular eye exams, and treatments like laser therapy or injections can help prevent vision loss in diabetic patients.  Regular eye exams are essential for early detection of vision problems and ensuring timely intervention to preserve vision. Eye health is closely linked to overall health, underscoring the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate rest, and protection from UV radiation.  In conclusion, the structure of the human eye is a marvel of biological engineering, allowing us to experience the beauty of the world around us. Understanding the components of the eye and common vision problems empowers us to make informed decisions about vision correction options suited to our individual needs. From eyeglasses and contact lenses to advanced surgical techniques, modern advancements in vision correction offer a wide range of solutions to enhance visual acuity and improve quality of life. Prioritizing eye health through regular check-ups and adopting healthy habits can help us enjoy clear vision and maintain optimal eye function for years to come.""","1062"
"401","""Literature ReviewIt is important, firstly, to understand exactly what I mean when I talk about the normalisation thesis. One important piece of research in this area is Parker et al and their book Illegal Leisure. The normalisation thesis is concerned with the accommodation of recreational drug use into youth society. Recreational drug use 'refers only to the use of certain drugs, primarily cannabis but also nitrates, amphetamines and equivocally LSD and ecstasy'. The normalisation thesis does not mean that it has become normal for young people to take drugs, but is concerned with 'the spread of deviant activity and associated attitudes from the margins towards the centre'. There has been a rise in drug trying since the 990s, with six in ten Britons trying drugs by the age of 8, and the reason for this increase is the increased availability of drugs 'in school, college, pub and club'. Other theorists, such as believe this to be the case, with a widespread increase in the use and experimentation of legal and illegal drugs among young people. Parker, H. et al, Illegal leisure: the normalization of adolescent recreational drug use, London and New York: Routledge, p. 5/82 Ibid, Ibid, p.5/83 Duff, C., 'Drugs and youth cultures: Is Australia experiencing the 'normalization' of adolescent drug use' in Journal of Youth Studies, Vol., no., p.34. However, the normalisation thesis is not just concerned with actual experiences and rises in drug use, but attitudes towards drugs. Even those who choose not to do drugs still have considerable knowledge about the recreational drug scene, and are seen as 'drugwise'. Abstainers constantly come into contact with drugs, as by simply being social and going out for the weekend, they will be likely to be offered them, or see people 'doing' them. They learn to draw distinctions between misuse of 'hard' 'sensible' recreational drug use, for example cannabis. Drug use is seen as deviant, but it is accommodated, with the individualisation of drug use being tolerated as 'it up to them if they want to kill themselves.' Parker et al, Illegal leisure: the normalization of adolescent recreational drug use, London and New York: Routledge, p. 5/85/8. Ibid, p.5/89. Moreover, the normalisation of drugs thesis can be seen as an example of postmodernism and post-subcultural theory. Subcultural theory is no longer relevant in discussing drugs as it has moved from a small minority experience into a majority activity. Also, subcultural experience tends to gravitate towards a preoccupation with drugs as a central tenant in the users lives; the heroin user of the 980s who pull are part of a distinct, criminal, lifestyle is one such example. The drug use described in the normalisation thesis is quite different due to its focus on recreational drug use. In addition, drug use is seen to cross structural boundaries such as class, where the drug user may be middle-class, and gender, with women being as likely to take drugs as men. Shildrick, T., 'Young people, illicit drug use and the question of normalization' in Journal of Youth Studies, Vol., No., p.9. Parker et al, Illegal leisure: the normalization of adolescent recreational drug use, London and New York: Routledge, p.5/86. Ibid. Ibid, p.5/83. In addition, this postmodern move into the mainstream is also seen through its absorption into consumer culture. The language and imagery of drugs has become absorbed into fashion, media, and music and the boundaries between licit and illicit behaviour has become blurred, as recreational drug use and drinking alcohol link together. The decline of tradition, brought about by globalisation, has eroded many of the norms that have underpinned social identity, meaning individuals rely on their own choices, struggling to maintain a stable sense of self, which leads to the production of the self through the act of consumption. Youth identity is created through this act, and the goods we buy tell us something about ourselves, forming a sense of self. Drug use takes place as part of this consumer lifestyle, with leisure time being an opportunity to express identity through the stylistic use of drugs. For example, the expression of identity is seen through the use, and normalisation, of recreation drugs within the current youth 'rave' scene. Recreational drug use is a vital part of this 'rave' experience, and is what Shapiro calls the 'drugs/music nexus'. The emergence of a distinct rave community in the 990s saw the use of ecstasy rise among the youth, with its use becoming a defining characteristic of the 'raver' identity. The consumption of drugs has become a 'distinctive cultural identity'. Ibid, p.5/87.

However, the normalisation thesis, as presented by Parker, is not accepted by all. The normalisation of drugs focuses on the individual, which 'obscures more fundamental, structural determinants of drug use'. Parker focuses on growing up in late modernity and living in a 'risk society' absorbing ideas of individual, subjective risk into his normalisation thesis. The significance of risk is associated with changes in late modernity, whereby the erosion of moved towards a society laden with uncertainty and constant risk as adolescents spend more time in a semi dependent state. Society has become increasingly individualised, and people strive to create their identity through consumerism, making routine 'recognisable cost-benefit assessments' about drugs. Drugs decisions become routine and trivial. MacDonald and Marsh reject this individualism, believing that structural determinant, such as changing drug markets influence drug use. They described how after a 'drought' on other forms of drugs, when Teesside was targeted by dealers, heroin became popular within those from socially excluded backgrounds.

I decided to situate the interview in my living room; with no-one else was at home, hoping my subject would felt more comfortable. Bryman, A. Social Research Methods, Oxford University Press, p.30. Moreover, the illegality of the subject matter under discussion also brings about ethical questions. As a sociologist, I am responsible for the 'social and psychological well-being of research participants'. I must protect the interests of my participant, and guard them from harm. Therefore it is very important I maintain his anonymity, and during this research I will be referring to him through a pseudonym; James. This concern for my research participant also led me to be as truthful and open to him as possible. I made James aware of his 'right to refuse participation', informing him of his anonymity and also that this work would not be published. In addition, due to the overt nature of my research I avoided the 'moral qualms, anxieties, and practical difficulties' 'covert' research has.

However, I did not go into too much detail about the exact reasons for the interview. Other than informing him of the basic subject matter, and asking him to be as truthful as possible, I did not want to provide him with too much information so as not to influence his behaviour and responses. Research should not be oversimplified into 'overt' and 'covert' but as a continuum, with all research having aspects of secrecy, as we can 'never tell the research subjects 'everything'' (Roth, 962:84). Ibid Furthermore, it is important to remember aspects of reflexivity when partaking in research. 'Good research is that which accounts for the conditions of its own production'. Self-awareness is important. As a researcher, I am part of the social world I am studying. Research is not neutral and is influenced by me, from the topic I chose to study, who I decided to interview, the questions I asked and how I decided to interpret and present the data. My choice of research topic is influenced by my values and interests and I chose to study the normalisation of drugs as I find the subject fascinating.

I wish to understand how James has come to interpret the also the 'thick description' prevalent when James talked about his drug experience. In addition, the normalisation thesis is not just based around actual drug use, but attitudes held by adolescents. Therefore it is important for James to tell his 'story' and the interview process should allow room for narrative and a 'sociology of stories'. Interview data should allow for biographical accounts that 'require of young people a coherent narrative that retells the story of the drugs career as a reflexive project of the self'. Ibid, p.

Pilkington, H. 'In good company: Risk, security and choice in young people's drug decisions' in The Sociological wanted valid, honest, reliable and truthful him simply trying to give responses that painted himself in a particular light. However, as the interview progressed he seemed to become more and more comfortable, moving on from giving short succinct answers to more developed responses, including one story of when he had been offered drugs by his friends: 'We were sitting in the woods whilst Rick sat and smoked weed. I didn't have any myself, I wasn't interested. I was happy with the alcohol, but the whole thing was really funny and stupid looking back. When you're a kid you do the most random things '.FindingsJames had smoked one occasion, therefore supporting the normalisation thesis. He has smoked it at a house party in the back garden; 'I though it was just a complete fuss over nothing, not very exciting at all, I went back to drinking my beer! It didn't really have that much affect.' James is more of an 'abstainer' according to Parker's thesis, (having only tried cannabis once), but does indeed to know about recreational drugs and is 'drugwise'. He knew where to get cannabis from, had watched many of his friends smoking cannabis, and had been offered it on a few occasions. He sees it as 'normal' for adolescents to take recreational drugs and his attitude towards them shows he found them to be deviant, but tolerable: Parker et al, Illegal leisure: the normalization of adolescent recreational drug use, London and New York: Routledge, p. 5/82. Ibid, p. 5/85/8. 'It's not really a crime, they're not criminals, but naughty people. I don't see smoking weed as doing anything wrong really I mean technically its illegal but it's your body, your choice' (my emphasis).However, his experiences of drugs were, I believe influenced by Shildrick did, however, this one interview does seem to suggest that there is a differentiated normalisation of drugs based on class difference and 'complexity and diversity in young people's experiences.' Shildrick, T., 'Young people, illicit drug use and the question of normalization' in Journal of Youth Studies, Vol., No., p. 7. Moreover, all of James experiences with drugs took place within the context of the peer group. James had been offered drugs in a club and did find this type of behaviour normal, (which does correspond with the normalisation thesis' emphasis on consumption of drugs in the 'rave' atmosphere). However, the time James' actually smoked cannabis had nothing to do with the 'rave' scene, and was at a house party, and another was offered it whilst sitting in some woods watching his friends smoke. This corresponds with Pilkington's analysis of drugs within the friendship group; he would not have taken drugs from strangers, as can be seen by his rejection of the pills offered to him at the club: 'I wasn't about to take it off a stranger!' All his experiences happened with friends, not alone, and he eventually tried it because he was in the mood, and felt 'curious'. Pilkington, H.

With changing attitudes towards substances that were once stigmatized, it is crucial to delve into the implications of this trend. This article will explore the factors contributing to the normalization of recreational drug use, its impact on individuals and communities, and the importance of open discussions and harm reduction strategies in addressing this complex issue.  One of the key drivers behind the normalization of recreational drug use is changing societal views towards certain substances. In recent years, there has been a shift away from the """"war on drugs"""" mentality towards a more liberal approach to drug policy. The legalization of cannabis in various countries and the decriminalization of certain substances have played a significant role in shifting perceptions of recreational drug use. As a result, drugs that were once considered taboo are now being viewed in a more relaxed light by a growing number of people.  Moreover, the portrayal of drug use in popular culture and the media has also contributed to its normalization. Films, music, and social media often glamorize drug use, depicting it as a normal and even desirable part of the lifestyle of certain subcultures. This pervasive imagery can desensitize individuals to the risks associated with drug use and create the perception that it is a common and acceptable behavior.  Another factor fueling the normalization of recreational drug use is the increasing accessibility of drugs. The rise of the internet and dark web has made it easier than ever for individuals to purchase a wide range of substances discreetly and without the need for face-to-face contact. Additionally, the prevalence of drug use at social events and festivals has further normalized the behavior, with many people experimenting with substances in these settings without facing significant consequences.  The normalization of recreational drug use has significant implications for individuals and communities. On an individual level, the normalization of drug use can lead to increased experimentation, especially among young people who may be more susceptible to peer pressure and societal influences. This can potentially lead to substance abuse issues, addiction, and other adverse health outcomes.  Furthermore, the normalization of drug use can contribute to the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes and inequalities. Certain marginalized communities may be disproportionately affected by drug-related issues, leading to social injustices and disparities in access to healthcare and support services. Moreover, the normalization of drug use can perpetuate misconceptions about addiction and mental health, hindering efforts to provide effective treatment and support for those in need.  In light of these challenges, it is essential to engage in open and honest discussions about recreational drug use. By fostering conversations that are free of judgment and stigma, we can promote greater awareness of the risks associated with drug use and empower individuals to make informed choices about their health and well-being. Education plays a crucial role in this regard, providing people with the knowledge and tools to understand the dangers of drug use and make responsible decisions.  Additionally, harm reduction strategies are key in addressing the normalization of recreational drug use. By implementing measures such as drug testing services, safe consumption sites, and overdose prevention programs, we can help mitigate the risks associated with drug use and prevent harm to individuals and communities. These strategies focus on reducing the negative consequences of drug use rather than solely focusing on prohibition, offering a more compassionate and effective approach to addressing drug-related issues.  In conclusion, the normalization of recreational drug use is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. By understanding the factors driving this trend, acknowledging its impact on individuals and communities, and promoting open discussions and harm reduction strategies, we can work towards creating a society that prioritizes health, safety, and well-being for all. It is through education, empathy, and evidence-based interventions that we can address the challenges posed by the normalization of recreational drug use and strive towards a healthier and more informed future.""","757"

These systems use solar thermal collectors to absorb sunlight and convert it into heat, which is then transferred to water stored in a tank for later use. Understanding the performance of these systems is crucial in determining their efficiency, reliability, and overall benefits to homeowners.  One of the key factors that influence the performance of a domestic solar water heating system is the design and size of the system. The size of the system should be adequate to meet the hot water demand of the household while taking into consideration factors such as the climate, available sunlight, and the number of occupants in the home. An appropriately sized system will ensure that enough hot water is generated when needed, maximizing the system's efficiency.  The type of solar thermal collectors used in the system also plays a significant role in its performance. There are various types of collectors available, including flat-plate collectors and evacuated tube collectors. Flat-plate collectors are more commonly used in domestic systems and are suitable for moderate climates, while evacuated tube collectors are more efficient in colder climates or areas with less sunshine. The choice of collector will impact the system's ability to harness solar energy effectively.  The orientation and tilt of the solar collectors can affect their performance. Ideally, collectors should be positioned facing south in the northern hemisphere or north in the southern hemisphere to receive maximum sunlight exposure throughout the day. The tilt angle of the collectors should also be optimized based on the system's location to ensure optimal energy absorption. Proper installation and positioning of the collectors are critical for maximizing the system's performance.  The efficiency of the solar water heating system is another crucial aspect to consider. Efficiency is a measure of how effectively the system converts solar energy into usable heat. Higher efficiency systems will require less sunlight to heat the water to the desired temperature, resulting in lower energy costs. Factors that can impact efficiency include the quality of the collectors, the insulation of the storage tank, and the overall design of the system.  Regular maintenance and monitoring are essential for ensuring the continued performance of a domestic solar water heating system. Components such as pumps, valves, and controllers should be inspected periodically to detect any issues that may affect the system's operation. Cleaning the collectors and ensuring that they are free from obstructions such as dirt or debris will also help maintain optimal performance.  Seasonal variations and weather conditions can impact the performance of solar water heating systems. During periods of reduced sunlight or colder temperatures, the system may require a backup source of energy, such as an electric or gas water heater, to ensure a constant supply of hot water. Integrating a backup system can help maintain comfort levels in the home and provide peace of mind during unfavorable weather conditions.  In conclusion, domestic solar water heating systems offer a sustainable and efficient way to meet hot water needs in residential settings. Understanding the factors that influence their performance, such as system design, collector type, efficiency, maintenance, and weather conditions, is essential for maximizing their benefits. By investing in a well-designed and properly maintained solar water heating system, homeowners can enjoy the advantages of lower energy costs, reduced environmental impact, and greater energy independence for their household.""","643"
"6192","""Virgil uses the Aeneid to showcase an exemplary Roman character, whose qualities and characteristics were inherently considered ideal for a Roman citizen, and so act as a role model for both citizen and leader alike. Williams sums this up in his precis of the heroic character in his book Aeneas and the Roman Hero: 'Virgil had to create in his hero a prototype of the Roman character, a person who showed by his behaviour the kind of qualities which had made Rome great and would make her greater still. He had to be an ideal Roman'. (Williams 999:8) Virgil takes the story of the founding of Rome and writes it using the popular media of epic poetry, both embracing and modernising Homeric technique in order to create a new type of hero relevant to a Roman society. This Roman hero would have to adhere to Roman virtues and reflect the Roman ideal; being pious and aspire to. Comparing it to Greek models of heroism can help to enhance our view of Aeneas' Roman characteristics, but can also show similarities between them, occasionally bringing to the surface some of Aeneas' more Homeric tendencies. On the whole, Aeneas can be regarded as a predominantly Roman hero, however I believe Virgil highlights certain elements of Aeneas' character that are more Homeric and as such, unsavoury to a Roman audience. It could be that Virgil is trying to illustrate human weakness, and although maintains an ideal to aspire to, realises that we can never completely achieve it. (Williams 999:5/8) We can also examine what would define Roman heroism and compare it to that of although his main enemies are mortals, fights a mythical being as well. He is presented as a rather more selfless leader than that of Greek epic, devoted to his quest for the greater good of the future of Rome. Although in regards to traditional Roman heroes he shares characteristics with the presentation of Greek heroes, observing Aeneas' Roman characteristics within his heroism is rather more successful. Virgil's Roman heroism is at odds with the Homeric heroism of the Odyssey and Iliad. The ideals of Rome are reflected in the heroism that Virgil depicts in the Aeneid, emphasising family, piety and duty. As a result Aeneas is a rather different hero to Odysseus; Virgil intends to reflect Roman ideals to portray a model Roman citizen and encourage national pride, whereas the Homeric heroes are rather less human, and are self-serving and glory-seeking, portraying supremacy. Gransden summarises his heroism in describing him as 'willing and ready to subordinate his individual will to that of destiny, the commonwealth and the future, reluctant to fight and not really interested in victory.' Aeneas has some instincts of a Greek upon killing Turnus when he should have showed mercy) but he has to countermand these in favour of Roman values and a selfless duty to the future state of Rome. Aeneas has to consider the future of an entire race of people and retain his devotion to his quest to found Rome, a far less selfish hero than that of the Homeric kind, where victory is motivated by personal glory. (Gransden 004:9) Aeneas cannot be an individualistic and selfish hero. Williams explains that he has to be 'the social man', always concerned with the good of his people in order to achieve the destiny of Rome. He has to be aware of his responsibility to his duty which includes looking out for the welfare of others without submitting to his own desires or becoming selfish and self-important. Aeneas is often described as being 'pius', (pietas is the noun) a Latin word encompassing the qualities aforementioned. It is a concept that was a vital Roman virtue, and is probably Aeneas' most treasured quality from an Augustan perspective. Pietas incorporates an immovable devotion to the gods, ones family, ones friends and one's major aspect of Virgil's heroism is to show Aeneas as both heroic and human. Aeneas is a good, strong leader, as is the case for Greek heroes, but also suffers from moments of self-doubt and depression: 'But the disaster had made him despondent and uncertain, and he reaches here his lowest ebb, actually wondering whether to 'forget the fates'.'Williams 999:4) He exhibits characteristics which humanise him, enabling Virgil to communicate to a contemporary audience the accessibility of Aeneas as a role model. Homeric heroes are typically semi-divine, self-assured and single-mindedly determined to succeed. In order to be perceived as great beings they need little human weakness, and this sets them apart from the general public. In contrast, Virgil's Roman hero is shown to be inherently human, despite Aeneas having a divine parent, and as such can act as a vehicle for Augustus and the Roman government to portray the model Roman citizen. The model Roman citizen however, requires Aeneas to become detached and prohibits emotional involvement, which could be said to dehumanise him. During his visit to the underworld he exhibits a newfound stoicism: 'Suffering cannot come to me in any new or unseen form. I have already known it. I have lived it all before'. (Book, p118)His subsequent self control and total devotion to his destiny are characteristically Roman; this is juxtaposed, however, with his human weaknesses early on and at the end of the poem, exemplifying how someone who is intrinsically human should master his emotions in order to fulfil the will of the gods and his destiny. It is Aeneas' destiny to found Rome. He is unable to follow his own will if he is to follow his destiny. This is exemplified in book where he has to leave Dido in order to pursue his destiny in Italy and explains that 'it is not by my own will that I search for Italy.' (Book, p79) It seems to be a characteristic Roman feature - to put duty to Rome above personal desires and to follow a supreme destiny as opposed to a personal quest. Despite Aeneas' seeming desire to stay with Dido, he still proves his dedication to his greater cause by suggesting to her that he had no intention of lingering in Carthage and that his love lies with the future of his Trojan people. He also backs his argument with the simple fact that leaving Carthage is beyond his control; the gods had demanded his devotion to the future of Rome. Despite his claims, he has the choice as to whether or not he follows his destiny, and it is by his own will that he pursues it; it is the content of his destiny he has no control over: 'Though Aeneas is commanded by a higher power, he is not compelled, and it is precisely the circumstance that his will is free and his decisions that distinguish his situation.'(Camps 969:3) The gods come to his assistance throughout the epic and help him to achieve settlement of the Trojan people in Rome, and always encourage him when the quest is neglected or being threatened with abandonment. Aeneas' devotion to the gods is a Roman ideal and divine intervention is key to his success. Turnus' furor juxtaposed against Aeneas' pietas exemplifies the different ideals of Homeric and Roman heroism. Turnus represents the Greek mould of hero, exhibiting obvious physical prowess, energy and violence, a merciless individualist who fights for his own personal glory and gain. Aeneas, on the other hand, is controlled, previously self-doubting but by the climax of the poem in possession of a quiet and assured strength, and fights in fulfilment of duty and destiny. Aeneas does not choose to fight, but Turnus is more than willing to resort to violence to obtain grandeur. Virgil engages the use of stock epithets to attribute particular characteristics to individuals and these can be used to identify the heroic differences between Aeneas and Turnus. Aeneas is frequently referred to as 'just' and 'good', and of course 'pius', the Latin word which encapsulates his pietas - his devotion to duty. The epithets prescribed to Turnus reflect the Homeric heroic model: 'proud', 'bold', 'violent', 'frenzied', and 'burning', with particular reference to his 'furor' - wild and passionate heroic anger. (Williams 999:6-) Aeneas' moment of heroic furor in which he savagely kills Turnus is among his most Homeric action in the poem. Virgil appears to attempt to depict Aeneas as displaying Roman ideals, but in places, such as Turnus's death, Aeneas shows signs of Greek heroism. Although he becomes more of a Roman hero throughout the Aeneid, Turnus' death at the end of the work exhibits Aeneas at his most Homeric in terms of heroism. When Aeneas gives in to his anger and kills Turnus, the fact that it has lead to the completion of his destiny can be seen as an event where the end justifies the means: '.this aggressive quality in Aeneas, which in another character be evidence of primitive, anachronistic emotions, seems to be redeemed by the end it serves.'(Van Nortwick 992:70) Aeneas is able to express emotion and take revenge upon Turnus because he knows it will not interfere with his destiny and the good of the future Rome, and so can submit to his humanity. This is not to say however, that Aeneas' moment of emotional weakness can be excused, as it is so important for Aeneas as a reflection of a Roman ideal to control the passions of his emotions. If he is to give in to his fury, as he does here, then he jeopardises the vision of a Roman future where the civilisation Aeneas brings will stamp out the archaic need to give in to violent emotion and chaos. Perhaps Virgil intends to present this dilemma to a contemporary audience to reflect the nature of the human condition, and to illustrate that we can only suppress our impulses so far. The Romans can bring civilisation, but not to a full and all-encompassing degree. In conclusion, Aeneas is very much Roman hero, encapsulating Roman ideals of pietas, being presented as accessibly human and as a result subject to weakness and lapses into Homeric characteristics. He remains dedicated to his destiny no matter what the cost, however, his attempts to check his emotions and control his furor are often compromised, and the vision of Rome as a civilising force where emotional control is key to peace is proved impossible to achieve completely. Aeneas may be characteristically Roman by majority, but Virgil seems to prove it impossible to completely adhere to Augustan ideals, perhaps a reflection of his view of Augustus' visions for the future Roman Empire, or indeed human nature in general.""","""Roman heroism in Virgil's Aeneid""","2265","""Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid, stands as a timeless testament to Roman heroism, valor, and the founding myth of Rome itself. Through the character of Aeneas, Virgil portrays the ideal Roman hero - one who embodies piety, duty, and resilience in the face of adversity. Aeneas's journey from Troy to Italy, guided by fate and the gods, encapsulates the virtues and values that the Romans held dear. The heroism depicted in the Aeneid is multifaceted, encompassing not just physical strength in battle, but also moral courage, leadership, and devotion to family and homeland.  At the core of Aeneas's heroism is his unwavering sense of duty and obligation. As a pious hero, he follows the will of the gods and accepts his destiny as a founder of Rome, despite the trials and hardships he must endure. Aeneas's commitment to his mission is exemplified when he carries his elderly father, Anchises, on his shoulders out of burning Troy, ensuring the survival of his family and the continuation of his lineage. This act of filial piety underscores the Roman value of honoring one's ancestors and upholding familial responsibilities.  Throughout his journey, Aeneas faces numerous challenges that test his resolve and leadership skills. From battling monsters like the Harpies and the Cyclops to navigating the treacherous seas, Aeneas demonstrates his prowess as a warrior and a strategist. His courage in the face of danger, his ability to rally his comrades in times of crisis, and his willingness to sacrifice personal desires for the greater good showcase his exemplary qualities as a hero. Aeneas's leadership is further highlighted in his role as the founder of the new Trojan settlement in Italy, where he establishes a community based on justice, order, and respect for the gods.  Virgil also emphasizes Aeneas's humanity and vulnerability, portraying him as a hero who experiences fear, doubt, and sorrow like any mortal. In his poignant encounter with Dido, the queen of Carthage, Aeneas grapples with conflicting emotions between his love for her and his duty to fulfill his destiny. Despite his own inner turmoil, Aeneas ultimately chooses to prioritize his mission over personal happiness, embodying the Roman ideal of sacrificing individual desires for the collective welfare of the community.  The Aeneid also delves into the concept of divine intervention and fate, underscoring the idea that true heroism lies in accepting one's role within a larger cosmic order. Aeneas's interactions with the gods, particularly his mother Venus and the god of war, Mars, highlight the intricate relationship between mortals and immortals in shaping the course of events. The divine guidance and protection that Aeneas receives serve to elevate his status as a hero chosen by destiny to fulfill a grander purpose.  In addition to Aeneas, the Aeneid features other notable characters who embody different facets of heroism. Characters like Pallas, Nisus, and Euryalus exemplify bravery in battle, loyalty to their comrades, and self-sacrifice for the greater good. These secondary heroes complement Aeneas's journey, illustrating that heroism is not limited to one individual but can be found in the collective actions of a community united by a common cause.  Virgil's depiction of heroism in the Aeneid extends beyond martial valor to encompass moral virtues such as integrity, compassion, and humility. Aeneas's interactions with the Trojan women, his respect for the fallen warriors, and his efforts to establish a harmonious society in Italy underscore the importance of ethical conduct and civic duty in shaping a true hero. By portraying heroism in a holistic manner, Virgil conveys the message that courage and nobility of character are essential components of a genuine hero.  The legacy of Roman heroism portrayed in the Aeneid continues to resonate in contemporary culture and serves as a source of inspiration for literature, art, and politics. The enduring appeal of Aeneas as a symbol of Roman virtue and resilience speaks to the universal themes of sacrifice, duty, and the quest for a higher purpose that transcend time and place. Through the character of Aeneas, Virgil not only celebrates the heroic ethos of ancient Rome but also offers a timeless reflection on the nature of heroism and its enduring relevance to the human experience.  In conclusion, the Aeneid stands as a seminal work that celebrates the ideals of Roman heroism through the character of Aeneas. By embodying virtues such as duty, courage, leadership, and moral integrity, Aeneas emerges as a paragon of heroism whose journey from Troy to Italy epitomizes the values that the Romans held dear. Through Virgil's masterful storytelling, readers are immersed in a world where divine providence, human agency, and the interplay between fate and free will converge to shape the destiny of a hero and the foundation of an empire. The Aeneid's exploration of heroism serves as a timeless reminder of the enduring power of myth, the complexities of human nature, and the eternal quest for excellence that defines the essence of heroism in its purest form.""","1050"
"374","""Georges' case indicates two separate grounds for judicial review. The first is substantive: this in itself raises the important issue of what standard of review should be applied and how this affects the constitutional role of the judiciary. This essay will argue that the courts have been too hesitant in applying intensive standards of review, and subsequently litigants are unable to predict the outcome of their cases. Secondly, is on the basis of a violation of the rules of natural justice, namely the rule against bias. These will now be considered respectively. Substantive Judicial Review S. of the HRA 998 provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right. George may contend that the regulations breach the right to private life, under article of the Convention, on the grounds that the searches demean his physical integrity Human Rights Act 998 European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Section the Supreme Court Act 981 provides a person has standing to initiate judicial review where he establishes sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates. Section the HRA 998 provides that a person has sufficient interest where he is or would be a victim of the act of the public authority, contrary to s. See X and Y v. Netherlands EHRR 35/8 for a useful definition of what constitutes privacy. X and Y v. Netherlands EHRR 35/8, also Joint Committee on Human Rights: Tenth Report Article Interference with article may be justifiable only where it is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security, public safety or prevention of disorder or crime. The standard of review to be implemented in cases concerning convention rights has been the subject of much confusion. Article the decision of the Court of Appeal in Smith it was thought that decisions which infringe upon convention rights should be assessed an enhanced wednesbury grounds in the context of human rights; that is the court will only set aside the decision of a body where it goes beyond the sphere of reasonable options available, and where there is a human right involved a greater justification of the reasonableness is required. However, when that reasoning was rebuked by the ECtHR on appeal, for failing to recognise poorly and often subjectively justified decisions which contravened human rights, but were not wholly unreasonable as to be unlawful, a proportionality based test was advocated. As decisions of the ECtHR are binding against the member state one should think George should be able to legitimately expect the test of proportionality to be applied. However, recent cases have shown this is not so. R v Ministry of Defence, Ex p Smith QB 17 Smith and Grady v, The United Kingdom EHHR 3985/8/6 and 3986/6 The basic facts of the present case are similar to Daly. Both involve long-term prisoners in a high security prison objecting to regulations on convention grounds. However, the appeal in Daly was confined to the argument that a blanket policy permitting examination of legally privileged correspondence in the prisoners' absence infringed rights recognised under both common law and article. Thus it will not possible to ascertain the outcome of the current case based on Daly. However, it will be useful to consider the reasoning of the court, who applied both an enhanced wednesburytest, in conjunction with proportionality in reaching the conclusion that Dalys' rights had in fact been infringed to an unnecessary and impermissible extent. Closing his argument Lord Steyn stated that the intensity of review in public law cases shall depend on the subject matter at hand, even in cases concerning Convention rights. Thus, intensive review which the ECtHR felt was necessary for protecting convention rights is by no means guaranteed domestically. Before we can discuss the possible reasons behind the reluctance to follow European jurisprudence, it will be necessary Georges' position under the different standards of review, R v. the Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Daly UKHL 6 HMP Whitemoor Daly, OpCit. Para See Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v. Wednesbury Corporation K.B. 33 at 34 and R v Ministry of Defence, Ex p Smith QB 17 Para 8, see also See Secretary of State for the Home Department WLR and R v Ministry of Defence, Ex p Smith QB 17 Was there a breach? It may be argued that the regulations were necessary in the prevention of crime and disorder or the protection of public safety in a democratic society. This is a convincing argument. Searches are now routine in many areas of life in the interest of public safety, for example when boarding an aeroplane or entering many high security buildings. One could argue that they are an expected and legitimate aspect of prison punishment. Nonetheless, the regulations must be either reasonable or proportionate to those aims. Since it is not possible to predict which test will be applied, we must prepare for both eventualities. ReasonablenessWas a blanket policy requiring searching of all prisoners before they are returned to their cells so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever come to it, given consideration interference with article? One could argue that it is not beyond the sphere of reasonable options available, as a maximum security prison in the interests of public safety and prevention of crime and disorder to require searches of all prisoners for, example, drugs and lethal weapons or other illicit material. It is stressed that the suffering should go beyond the legitimate form of punishment. Whereas Daly did succeed under reasonableness, the illicit contents which may be hid in correspondence is small whereas illicit contents which may be hid on the body is much greater and so is not wholly unreasonable. On the other hand one may speculate, that on the basis of Daly, in general blanket policies ought to be very strongly justified, more so where a human right is involved. Upon weighing up the evidence I am inclined to argue that Daly would be distinguished on the grounds that a greater level of interference existed, thus the regulations are not unreasonable or incompatible with article.. Secretary of State for the Home Department UKHL 6 Proportionality The contours of proportionality, as considered in Daly, are that in determining whether an interference of human rights is so excessive as to constitute a breach the court shall consider: Whether a legislative objective of sufficient importance to justify limiting a fundamental right be identified: There is insufficient information available as to the motives of the prison in enforcing these regulations. However, using the same argument as above, it may be argued that the searches are justified by the need to keep drugs out of prison or ensure inmates do not have access to lethal weapons, in the interest of preventing crime and disorder. Whether the measures designed to meet the legislative objective are rationally connected to it: Using the example above, this is a suitable method to ensuring those goals. Whether the means used to impair the right of freedom are no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective: There may be less intrusive means of meeting those goals available, for example using metal detectors or doing random spot checks. Thus the regulation may be declared incompatible under the latter, but not the first test. The effect of such a declaration is not so wide that it substitutes the regulation but effectively narrows the substantive choices available. s. - s. Human Rights Act 998 Whilst we do not have enough information to ascertain positively the outcome of proportionality, the above demonstrates the difference between the two standards. Greater scrutiny of decisions is required, balancing the pros and cons rather than merely what is in the sphere of reasonable options available. Proportionality places the burden of responsibility firmly on the public body, and by return increasing the protection of the citizen. See further, Gale, S. Unreasonableness and Proportionality: Recent Developments in Judicial Review, Scots Law Times The problem with proportionality Where there is no consistency of review, citizens inevitably receive differing standards of justice. The difference, as Elliot notes, is one of degree rather than type. Proportionality scrutinises the same behaviour as the former, only applying a greater degree of scrutiny and contextual awareness. Both standards recognise the need to balance the litigants' rights against competing policy and matters of public interest, but vary in the magnitude of discretion accorded to the court. Elliot writes that the move towards proportionality signifies shifting role of judiciary in constitutional order. Such intrusive reviewing of policy has not been within the traditional jurisdiction of the English judge. The introduction of proportionality demonstrates the impact of European jurisprudence on the role of the domestic judge in ways more subtle and unexpected than expressed in the human rights legislation itself. Elliot, M. The Human Rights Act 998 and The Standard of Substantive Review, Cambridge Law Journal - 06 And perhaps, this is the root of the problem. The test of proportionality has been developed in a European context, in the ECJ and in the ECtHR, not in consideration of the constitutional role of domestic courts. British courts have long rejected proportionality as an independent grounds for review, regarding it as being both supplementary to their constitutional role and unnecessary. Lord Diplocks' famously espoused dictum that one should not use a 'steam hammer to crack a nut if a nut cracker would do' represents the sentiment that the court should intervene no more than is necessary to fulfil their judiciary duties. In fact to do so may be to supercede their powers and to go against the will of Parliament and thus act undemocratically. This was certainly the view of the Attorney-general in the Belmarsh case stating that: R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind AC 96 UKHL R v. Goldstein W.L.R 5/81 at 5/85/8, see further: Wong, G., Towards the Nutcracker Principle: Reconsidering the Objections to Proportionality, Public Law, 'a wide margin of discretion should be accorded at each stage in the analysis to the executive and to Parliament'.. Secretary of State for the Home Department UKHL 6, Para 00 This submission, based upon the assertion that those elected bodies are the only ones qualified to consider matters of policy in a Democratic society must be countered by the need for the courts to intervene, where appropriate, in the protection of human rights and freedoms. This too, according to Lord Hope, is in the interests of a democratic society. This is undoubtedly true. If the Judiciary cannot be entrusted with the task of ensuring elected officials do not use their power inappropriately against civil and human rights, then who can? Lever argues that the Judicial review has an important function in democratic society, not because Judicial decision are necessarily better than legislative decisions, but because it is publicly accessible in a way that Parliament is not and provides a means for holding Government directly accountable. Ibid. Lever, A., Is Judicial Review Undemocratic?, Public Law, 80 -98 Numerous cases have been faced with the same question following Daly, with no clear pattern emerging. The Belmarsh case provides the greatest affirmation of the proportionality test yet. It should however be noted that the requirement of such a stringent standard of review was required implicitly by the terms of the order and Convention article under review and sadly such enthusiasm cannot be applied freely too all human rights cases. Whereas the court in the immigration and human rights case Ahzal decided an enhanced wednesbury test was most appropriate, the court in Baiai, another immigration and human rights case, utilised proportionality. However, as immigration is 'a broad social and political area and the judiciary were not policymakers' substantial deference was allowed to Parliament when restricting rights. This shows that whereas the judiciary are becoming more confident in their application of intensive review, progress is painstakingly slow and apprehensive, but necessary. The judiciary cannot properly perform its role of review where it is constrained by too feeble tools. As Lord Cooke in Daly stated, the time is imminent when the courts must accept that: CSOH 9 R. (on the application of Baiai) v Secretary of State for the Home Department, R. (on the application of Bigoku) v Secretary of State for the Home Department, R. (on the application of Tilki) v Secretary of State for the Home Department, R. (on the application of Trzcinska) v Secretary of State for the Home Department. April 006 Article 2 'The law can never be satisfied in any administrative field merely by a finding that the decision under review is not capricious or absurd'Judicial review: Natural Justice Natural justice, sometimes referred to as a duty to act fairly, has two governing principles: Firstly is the right to fair hearing and, secondly the rule against bias. This is notwithstanding the right to a fair trial under article of the Convention. The role of the Deputy Governor as responsible for hearing George's case, as responsible for searches, and the fact he was present during Georges search compromises' his impartiality. This appears to contravene the fundamental maxim of natural justice: 'No man is permitted to be a judge in his own cause'. 'Nemo debet esse judex in properial sua Causa' It has long been established that public bodies exercising a statutory duty are obliged to observe the rules of natural justice.Thus, George should seek leave for judicial review, within three months, under Order 3 based on his legitimate expectation that the rules of natural justice would be adhered to. To avoid confusion, it will be appropriate to talk about procedural impropriety: In CCSU v. Minister for the Civil Service it was held that procedural impropriety includes both a breach of statutory procedural requirements, such as the human rights act, and the common law rules governing natural justice. Ridge v. Baldwin AC 0 As amended by s.1 of the Supreme Court Act 981 CPR 4 See CCSU v Minster for the Civil Service AC 74, HL This is important as we shall see there is considerable overlap between the right to a fair hearing under article of the convention and the principles of natural justice. What is the test of bias? In Re: Medicaments the bias test was held to be: Re: Medicaments and Related WLR 2 whether the judge has been shown to have been influenced by any actual bias, or; whether, if on objective appraisal, applying the reasonable man test, the material facts give rise to a legitimate fear that the judge is not. Secretary of State for the Home Department;. Secretary of State for the Home Department UKHL W.L.R search order The facts are almost identical to the present case, so much so that it would be expected that a judge apply similar reasoning. That is: the fact that the deputy governor was responsible for implementing searches explicitly endorses their use, and his presence when George refused the search which may be said to tacitly condemn his refusal so much so that a fair minded observer could legitimately think that he was predisposed to find the refusal of the searches unlawful, as to do otherwise would be to admit that the searches were wrong and he was wrong to endorse them. Thus, there exists the appearance of bias and the decision should be quashed. See further, Porter v Magill UKHL 7 Article George may also apply for a declaration that the proceeding were in breach on article: right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. The rule against bias, above, and the right to a fair trial under article overlap in many ways as where a judge is biased, then the tribunal cannot be said to be independent and impartial. This is so true that in both Alconbury and the court considered the right to fair trial under article six under the same ambit as bias, concluding that the right added nothing more than was already contained in the test for actual bias: R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet, as we concluded the deputy governor violated the rule against bias he also violated the right to a fair trial. ConclusionsRather disappointingly, the first thing one can conclude is the answer to Georges' substantive review is inconclusive. We cannot say which standard of review will be applied, although the case law would suggest the higher the interference with the human right, the more likely it is the courts will review more stringently. This raises important constitutional issues which transcend the difficulties of the current case. Where the courts are so afraid of violating their constitutional roles they shy away from more rigorous review, they, paradoxically, fail to fulfil that role fully. Secondly, the role and conduct of the Deputy Governor violates the rule against bias. Consequently the decision shall be quashed and in the long term the hearing functions of the Governor shall have to be transferred. See, A v. Secretary of State for the Home Department and Daly OpCit""","""Judicial Review Standards and Human Rights""","3400","""Judicial review plays a pivotal role in upholding human rights and ensuring that laws and governmental actions adhere to constitutional principles. This process allows courts to review legislative and executive actions to determine their constitutionality, ensuring that the rights of individuals are protected. Judicial review standards serve as guidelines for judges to evaluate laws and government actions, balancing the need for government authority with the protection of individual rights. In this discussion, we delve into the significance of judicial review standards in safeguarding human rights, exploring the fundamental principles that underpin this process.  One of the key aspects of judicial review standards is the principle of constitutional supremacy. This principle establishes that the constitution is the supreme law of the land, and all other laws, including those enacted by the legislature or actions taken by the executive branch, must conform to its provisions. By enforcing constitutional supremacy through judicial review, courts ensure that the government operates within the limits set by the constitution, thereby protecting individual rights from arbitrary or unjust governmental actions.  In the context of human rights, judicial review standards serve as a crucial mechanism for preventing abuses of power and safeguarding the fundamental freedoms of individuals. Courts play a vital role in interpreting and applying human rights provisions enshrined in constitutions or international treaties, ensuring that these rights are not violated by governmental actions. Through judicial review, courts hold governments accountable for their actions, providing a check on potential abuses of power and preserving the rule of law.  The concept of proportionality is another fundamental aspect of judicial review standards in the context of human rights. Proportionality requires that any limitation on individual rights by the government must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. This principle ensures that government actions do not unduly infringe on the rights of individuals and that any restrictions imposed on rights are justified in pursuit of a legitimate public interest. Courts apply the proportionality test to assess the necessity, suitability, and proportionality of government actions, striking a balance between the state's interests and individual rights.  Furthermore, the principle of legality is integral to judicial review standards concerning human rights. This principle mandates that government actions must be based on clear legal authority and must comply with the law. Courts scrutinize government actions to ensure that they are grounded in law and do not exceed the powers granted to the government by the constitution or legislation. By upholding the principle of legality, courts prevent government overreach and protect individuals from arbitrary exercises of power.  Another significant consideration in judicial review standards related to human rights is deference to the expertise and discretion of government bodies. Courts recognize that certain policy decisions and administrative actions require specialized knowledge and expertise, and they exercise deference to the decisions of these bodies within their areas of expertise. However, courts maintain the authority to intervene when government actions violate constitutional rights or principles, ensuring that human rights are upheld even in cases involving administrative discretion.  Moreover, the concept of dialogue between branches of government is essential in the context of judicial review standards and human rights protection. Judicial review fosters a dialogue between the judiciary, legislature, and executive branches, allowing for checks and balances to operate effectively. Courts interpret the law and ensure that governmental actions comply with constitutional standards, while the other branches retain the authority to enact laws and implement policies. This dialogue ensures that the protection of human rights is a collaborative effort among branches of government, maintaining the balance of power and accountability.  In conclusion, judicial review standards play a vital role in safeguarding human rights by ensuring that governmental actions adhere to constitutional principles and respect individual freedoms. Through principles such as constitutional supremacy, proportionality, legality, deference, and dialogue, courts uphold the rule of law and prevent abuses of power. By maintaining a balance between governmental authority and individual rights, judicial review standards contribute to a just and rights-respecting society where the rights and dignity of every individual are protected.""","760"

Rules Specifically Relating to Child SoldiersThe GCs or APs do not explicitly state that children can never become combatants. Instead, certain provisions place limits on the authorities in control of recruitment, as follows: Additional Protocol Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, relation to child soldiers, articles of AP I state that: 'The Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces. In recruiting among those persons who have attained the age of fifteen years but who have not attained the age of eighteen years, the Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to give priority to those who are oldest.' Additional Protocol I, above no, article Protocol Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-international Armed Conflict, 977 In relation to child soldiers, article AP II states that: 'children who have not attained the age of fifteen years shall neither be recruited in the armed forces or groups nor allowed to take part in hostilities.'Additional Protocol II, above no, article that the special protections to be afforded to children in non-international armed conflict under AP II remain applicable to children under the age of 5/8 even if they take direct part in hostilities despite article are captured.

A review of the original negotiation in relation to the drafting of the APs reveals a desire by governments not to enter into absolute prohibitions regarding the voluntary participation of children in armed conflict. The protection and status of child soldiers involved in conflict deemed to be below a; minimal protection and regulation of child soldiers during actual conflict. Focus of ReportThe issues surrounding child soldiers are complex and it is beyond the scope of this report to consider each of the above issues comprehensively. Instead, this report focuses primarily on the fifth issue, namely the protection and regulation of children once they actually become child been a significant milestone in the reflection of, and contribution to, a growing consensus by the international community for adoption of 8 as the minimum age for recruitment. Wells, above no 9, 96. Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, opened for signature 5/8 May 000, (entered into force 2 February 002). For a discussion of this issue, see Udombana, above no 4, 1-01. However, whilst the current gap between the idealism of a complete exclusion of children and the realities of an ever increasing use of child soldiers persists, it is unrealistic not to consider the application of IHL to child soldiers, where they become involved in practice despite the the involvement of children in hostilities. In this regard, the restricted approach of IHL offer little express assistance to child soldiers or acknowledgement of their particular position. Effect of Combatant Status on Child Soldiers Once children participate actively or directly in non-international armed conflict, their status under the present IHL framework is recognised as that of combatants and consequently they lose the more substantive humanitarian protections afforded to civilians under the framework of IHL. This is the case whether such involvement is voluntary or forced. Wells, above no 9, 97. Whilst child soldiers maintain the special protections afforded to children under IHL, these are arguably inadequate to recognise their involvement in combat. AP II does not establish minimum humanitarian standards of treatment that ought to apply to children who do participate in conflicts. Further, from the perspective of child soldiers, the protections guaranteed to civilians may appear more important than the special protections afforded to children as the former more expressly provide for their humane treatment at all times. Additional Protocol II, above no, article measures are required to be taken 'to remove children temporarily from the area in which hostilities are taking place to a safer area within the country', action that surely contradicts the intentions of the armed groups towards their own child soldiers. Even if this is not the intention, it is unlikely that the general protections afforded to children will realistically be guaranteed in circumstances where children have been forcibly recruited into armed forces by commanders with little concern for their welfare, or indeed the legality of their participation generally. Additional Protocol II, above no, article to fend for themselves if they leave dissident army forces, due to the same factors that prompted their involvement in the first place, such as poverty, hunger, displacement from family and home, and a lack of regular structure due to also have implications for child soldiers post-conflict, both in terms of their own potential prosecution and the prosecution of persons committing offences against them during and after recruitment. See generally, Wells, above no 9. Failure to Obtain Even the 'Special Protection' Under IHLIn certain circumstances, child soldiers may not even be guaranteed the special protections guaranteed to children under IHL, primarily for the following reasons: Difficulties in Invoking AP IIEven where the relevant conflict can be categorised objectively as that in relation to which AP II would ordinarily apply, it may be the case that the requirements of its article are not technically met, the relevant state has not ratified AP II, and/or the dissident armed force or other organised armed group has not made a unilateral declaration confirming its acceptance of AP II. Additional Protocol II, above no, article. That is, where the non-state party to the conflict does not 'exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement. See Cohn and Goodwin-Gill, above no 5/8, 6-7, for examples of non-international conflict where states have not ratified AP II, and examples of non-international conflict where states and non-state parties have been prepared to be bound by AP II. Conflict CategorisationChild soldiers are often involved in conflict which does not appear to reach the threshold required by AP II and therefore will not be subject to the special protection provisions of IHL. Ibid 0. In such cases, domestic law and pertinent human rights applicable even in the absence of the special protections offered to children generally under IHL. Further, the minimal conditions of Common Article to the GCs will continue to govern this type of internal conflict, although they place no limits on the recruitment or participation of children. Conclusion and RecommendationsConclusionThis report has sought to demonstrate that the current framework of IHL is not effective in relation to the protection and regulation of child soldiers in their status as combatants. The nature of the underlying causes for child soldier participation, their treatment during and following recruitment, and the roles that they perform demonstrate that children are both combatants and victims of serious human rights violations in armed conflicts. Wells, above no 9, 02 A number of preliminary recommendations are set out below, for the purpose of provoking further discussion and a consideration of potential revision to IHL to facilitate its enhanced applicability to modern conflict. of Underlying ConditionsFurther research and discussions ought to be conducted in order to reach a better understanding of and to address the underlying causes of the participation and use of children as child soldiers. Udombana, above no 4, 06. IHL applies only during conflict. For child soldiers to be protected adequately from participation, during and post conflict, in their capacity as children, it is important to take a more holistic approach and 'acknowledge and address the entire context of conflict - the social, cultural, geopolitical, economic, geographical, development and equity considerations - in which children become weapons of war'. Radio National, above no 3. Complementary Branches of International LawFurther consideration of and strengthening of the relationship between IHL and international human rights, international criminal law and international labour law ought to be pursued for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a minimal standard of humanitarian relation to child soldiers in non-international conflict and in situations short of the relevant threshold, where IHL fails to fulfil its protective objective. Allan Rosas and Monika Sandvik-Nylund, 'Armed Conflicts' in Asbjrn Eide, Catarina Krause and Allan. Of particular relevance is article 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the accepted and promoted widely.""","""Child Soldiers and International Law""","2109","""Child soldiers represent a harrowing intersection of human rights abuses and the horrors of armed conflict. These underage combatants, often forced or coerced into military service, are a clear violation of international law and a tragic consequence of conflict-ridden regions around the world. Efforts to address this grave issue have been ongoing for decades, with significant progress made in establishing legal frameworks and mechanisms to protect and rehabilitate child soldiers.  The use of child soldiers perpetuates a cycle of violence and exploitation that not only robs children of their childhood but also violates their fundamental rights as outlined in various international conventions and treaties. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) defines a child as anyone under the age of 18 and explicitly prohibits the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts. Additionally, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC) sets a minimum age of 18 for direct participation in hostilities and prohibits the recruitment and use of children under the age of 15.  Despite these clear legal provisions, child soldiers continue to be recruited and exploited in conflicts around the world. Factors such as poverty, lack of access to education, societal instability, and the breakdown of family structures contribute to the vulnerability of children to recruitment by armed groups. These children are often subject to indoctrination, violence, and abuse, depriving them of their rights to education, healthcare, and a safe environment.  International law plays a crucial role in addressing the issue of child soldiers by establishing norms, standards, and mechanisms for accountability. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) includes the conscription, enlistment, and use of child soldiers under the war crime of conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 into the armed forces or using them to participate actively in hostilities. This recognition of child soldiering as a war crime underscores the seriousness of the issue and the need for justice for the victims.  Moreover, the Security Council of the United Nations has taken steps to address the issue of child soldiers through its resolutions, such as Resolution 1612 (2005) on Children and Armed Conflict. This resolution establishes a monitoring and reporting mechanism to document and prevent violations against children affected by armed conflict, including the recruitment and use of child soldiers. By holding parties to conflicts accountable for such violations, the international community aims to deter the use of child soldiers and promote the protection of children's rights in conflict-affected areas.  In addition to legal frameworks, efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate child soldiers into their communities are essential for breaking the cycle of violence and addressing the long-term impacts of their exploitation. Rehabilitation programs focus on providing psychological support, education, vocational training, and other services to help former child soldiers heal from their traumatic experiences and rebuild their lives. These programs also aim to address the root causes of child recruitment, such as poverty and lack of educational opportunities, to prevent future generations from being drawn into armed conflict.  Civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations play a vital role in advocating for the rights of child soldiers and supporting their rehabilitation and reintegration efforts. These organizations work on the ground to provide direct assistance to affected children, raise awareness about the issue, and hold governments and armed groups accountable for their actions. By mobilizing public opinion and pressuring stakeholders to uphold their obligations under international law, these groups contribute to the global effort to end the use of child soldiers and protect children from the ravages of war.  Despite progress in addressing the issue of child soldiers, significant challenges remain. Conflict zones continue to see the recruitment and use of child soldiers, and more needs to be done to prevent such violations, hold perpetrators accountable, and support the rehabilitation of affected children. Strengthening legal frameworks, increasing resources for prevention and protection efforts, and addressing the root causes of child recruitment are key priorities for the international community in combatting this egregious violation of children's rights.  In conclusion, the use of child soldiers represents a grave violation of international law and an affront to the rights and dignity of children caught in armed conflicts. Legal frameworks and mechanisms have been established to address this issue, but more concerted efforts are needed to protect children from recruitment, support their recovery and reintegration, and prevent future generations from suffering the same fate. By upholding the principles of human rights, justice, and accountability, the international community can work together to end the scourge of child soldiering and create a safer and more secure world for all children.""","908"

Women may also have a romanticized view of the men in the country of destination, due in part largely to stereotypes that are fostered by the mail order industry. 'The purpose behind the perpetuation of these stereotypes is to convince clients that they are getting a higher quality of mate than they could find in their home country.' Ibid. The way potential MOB are portrayed by the mail order industry is fairly universal. The industry caters to what is perceived as the antithesis to Western women. MOB are characterized as docile, subservient and eager to assume the role of the traditional 'housewife'. Men have claimed that the feminist movement is one of the main reasons for seeking an international bride. Using the U.S. as an example, 'there is displeasure among American men that American women are not content as wives and mothers, but rather seek personal fulfillment through their own careers and interests. Foreign women are thought to be happy as homemakers and mothers serving the interests of their husbands.' Ibid. at 43. The Consumer: Western MenA pre-Internet survey 'by David Jedlicka found that the men participating in these relationships were generally white, highly educated, politically and ideologically conservative, and generally economically and professionally successful.' There is a tendency for consumers to be significantly older then the MOB and for them to have had previous marriages. The concern for many human rights groups is that with the presumption that consumers will be obtaining a woman that is subordinate and docile, there is an equated presumption that they are seeking a woman to dominate. Many of the consumers 'feel empowered by the number of women they have to choose from when using mail-order bride agencies. The man usually has his pick of extremely young and beautiful women that he might not were he trying to court women in his native country.' Given the proven psychological link between male domestic violence abusers and insecurity and low self-esteem, there is obvious reason for the concern that consumers attracted to the MOB industry are those that fall into the category of potential abusers. 'While no national figures exist on abuse of alien wives, there is every reason to believe that the incidence is higher in this population than for the nation as a whole. Authorities agree that abuse in these marriages can be expected based on the men's desire for a submissive wife.' Ibid. at 42. Ibid. at 43. Robert J. Scholes, Appendix A: The 'Mail-Order Bride' Industry and its Impact on U.S. Immigration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, online: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services < URL > Accessed on April 5/8, 007 The Distributor/Marketer: The International Marriage AgenciesThere is limited information about International Marriage enacted under Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization act of 005/8. It was drafted as one of the only attempts made so far to regulate International Marriage Agencies. The main focus of IMBRA is controlling the information that is disseminated by the IMA. IMBRA seeks to control underage marriages by prohibiting the transfer of personal information of females under the age of 8 to a potential consumer by an IMA. The IMA is obligated to collect a consumer's personal information, disseminate it to the MOB, provide the MOB with information about her legal rights as a US immigrant, and obtain the consent of a MOB to release of her personal information to the consumer. One interesting aspect of IMBRA is that it compels the US Office of Homeland Security to develop a database that tracks multiple applications for a K-.6 JPSC prove to the visa officer that he or she is free to marry, that he or she is over the minimum age to be married in Canada and that marriage is not solely for the purpose of immigration. He or she is then given the permanent resident status on the understanding that the marriage will take place within 0 days of arrival.' Once the couple is married, the foreign spouse's permanent residency is independent of her relationship with the Canadian spouse. While this is obviously better than the pre-IRPA legislation, which tied a foreign spouse to their sponsoring partner for 0 years, it still presents difficulties for women. For example, if women are abused within the 0-day period before the marriage, they will be deported if they leave their future spouse. This can pose incredible difficulties for women who are culturally limited in terms of their reputation if they end the engagement and return to their home country. Additionally, there have been grave difficulties for immigrant spouses who have been socially isolated by their Canadian spouse and are not aware that their immigration status is no longer tied to their Canadian spouse's after the marriage.

Hell is a Chinese salary, an English chef, a Japanese home and an American wife.'Nicole Constable, Romance on a Global Stage: Pen Pals, Virtual Ethnography, and 'Mail Order' Marriages, (London: University of California Press, Ltd., 003) at 45/8. Feminist Discourse on Mail Order BridesWithin feminist discourse on the issue, there are diametrically opposing views on why women become mail order brides and how mail order brides should be 'classified'. There are those who take the view that 'sex tourism, mail-order-brides and prostitution are variations on the theme of sexual exploitation.' A report by the Coalition Against Trafficking Against Women states that 'the trade in mail-order-brides is a form of trafficking in women. Bride trafficking enables men from wealthier countries to seek and acquire women from impoverished countries or those in economic crisis.' However, there are many feminists who take the opposing view. They believe that while it cannot be denied that women who become MOB originate from developing countries with weakened and gendered economic and social structures, it is an economic decision made choice on the part of the women who participate in the MOB industry. This view recognizes that many MOB face risks of personal violence as a result of gendered power structures, but believes that to class MOB as 'victims' or worse, 'prostitutes' disempowers them. Donna M. Hughes, Pimps and Predators on the Internet-Globalizing the Sexual Exploitation of Women and Children, University of Rhode Island, online: < URL > Accessed on April 5/8, 007 Ibid. The concern with the 'exploitation' view is that it undermines the power of the women as individuals to make choices and have their choices respected. As stated by Nicole Constable in her critique of the exploitation view, 'assuming that Asian women are objects who are bought and sold, that their culture is traditional and unchanging. women of their ability to express intelligence, resistance, creativity, independence, dignity and strength.' However, the assumption that all women participating in the mail order bride industry make their choice freely and unhampered by gendered constructs is naive. The fact remains that some women are trafficked into prostitution after agreeing to a mail order bride transaction. Likewise, a number of mail order brides experience personal violence as a result of their marital transaction. These facts cannot be denied. There is a need for a new understanding of mail order brides: one that respects the mail order bride's personal decisions, but also recognizes the need for support for mail order brides and an awareness of the personal dangers they face. The solution lies in policing the risks women face, rather than the women's decisions. Supra note 5/8 at 0. The Economic and Social Context for the Filipino Mail Order Bride IndustryOne of the most commonly accepted reasons that women become MOB that is because of the economic and social situations in their country of origin. 'Economic considerations and obtaining permanent residency in the United States are often important factors in influencing a woman to become involved in the mail-order industry.' This is particularly the case with the Philippines, where there is a long-history with the United States. However, it cannot be denied that Filipinas MOB are also destined for Japan, and for Canada which is a growing destination for MOB and is likely to increase in the near future. Supra note at 42. The Philippines has limited industries and has not been successful in marketing itself to foreign investment and development in the same way many other Asian countries have been. 'As a developing country, the gap between the rich and the poor in the Philippines continues to worsen. Seventy percent of the population lives below the poverty line, mostly peasants and workers.' As in much of the developing world, Filipina women comprise the majority of those living in poverty in the Philippines. Philippine Women Centre of B.C., Canada: The New Frontier for Filipino Mail-Order Brides, online: Status of Women Canada < URL > at 1. Access on April 5/8, 007 One of the main economic sectors for the Philippines is tourism. 'Under the policy of tourism development, Filipinas are also used as prime selling points to attract foreigners to the Philippines. Filipinas are thus pushed into the informal sectors of the Philippine economy, most tragically into prostitution. Despite the fact that 'sex for a component of the indigenous culture of the Philippines', the Philippines now has the highest number of prostitutes in Southeast Asia - 00,00 - according to the International Labour Organization.' Ibid. at 2. However, the primary economic resource of the Philippines lies in exporting its citizens. The government actually encourages emigration through its Labour Export by the International Monetary the World Bank as conditions for borrowing.' However, despite pushing its nationals towards emigrating, the government has done little to make Filipinos aware of the risks involved, including the potential for violence, discrimination and exploitation. The fact that their country of origin happens to be 'the top labour exporter in the entire world, described as the world's largest migrant nation', certainly influences the MOB decision to emigrate. Ibid. at 1. Ibid. at 0. The economic migration sector that has experienced the greatest growth in the last decade is the export of workers for informal employment - domestic work, entertainment, and prostitution. Now the category of mail order bride must also be added to this category of informal employment. '. On the one hand, women who are considered as poor, low-earning and in that regard low value-adding individuals, often represented as a burden rather than a resource, and on the other hand, what are emerging as significant sources for profit making, especially in the shadow economy, and for government revenue enhancement.' Ed. Krielmild Saunders, Feminist Post-Development Thought, (London: Zed Books Ltd., 002) at 1. The Impact of the Chain on Gendered Structures It is clear from the discussion of the description of the characteristics and reasoning of the male suitors, that the social structure of society plays a critical role. As men search for a woman to fulfill the traditional role of wife - unpaid domestic labour and childcare included with love and devotion - they are inevitably participating in the global economic order, as they are paying into the system to find their bride. The MOB industry is flourishing in the new millennium - a time of globalization and unadulterated capitalism. Author Yu Kojima states in her article on cultural reproduction and MOB, that 'capitalism cannot function without patriarchy.' She clarifies this by stating that 'the key characteristics of capitalism is the social and sexual division of labor. involves two main dimensions - within paid work and between paid and unpaid work - and operates to value men's work more highly than women's work.' Yu Kojima, In the Business of Cultural Reproduction: Theoretical Implications of the Mail-Order Bride Phenomenon 4 Women's Studies International Forum 99 at 00. Ibid. at 01. One interesting aspect of the mail order bride phenomenon is the correlation between the stereotyping of women and the cause-and-effect dynamic it has had on Western women and Filipina women. As stated above, many men have claimed that Western women no longer make adequate wives. As women become more powerful, both economically and socially, their value has decreased in the view of a signification portion of the Western male population. The correlation between the commencement of the feminist movement in the 970s, and the upsurge in the mail order bride industry cannot be denied. However, one of the results of the shift in social structure in the West has been an alteration in social structure in the Philippines (and other countries of origin for mail order brides); women are shifting in the social structures as they become a valued economic resource, if only for exportation. CONCLUSIONAt every level of the chain, from the Mail Order Brides as the product, to Western men as consumers, to the direction of State policies regarding MOB, gendered relations and effects are present. Whether the actors in the chain act under duress or choice, the ramifications remain the same: gendered structures are affected the world over. The global sex chain of Filipina mail order brides and Western consumers is much like any other commodity chain - it creates both bridges of opportunity and vises of exploitation.""","""Mail Order Bride Industry Dynamics""","3040","""The mail-order bride industry has long been a subject of fascination and controversy, with its roots tracing back to the 19th century when lonely pioneers sought companionship in the form of women from distant lands. Today, the dynamics of this industry have evolved significantly, influenced by factors such as globalization, technology, and changing societal norms.  One of the key drivers of the mail-order bride industry is the disparity in gender ratios in certain countries. In regions where there is a surplus of men or where women face socioeconomic challenges, the opportunity to marry a foreign man through a matchmaking agency can be seen as a way to improve one's quality of life. This imbalance in gender ratios creates a demand for women who are willing to marry men from more affluent countries in exchange for a chance at a better future.  Globalization and the advent of the internet have revolutionized the way the mail-order bride industry operates. What was once a predominantly paper-based correspondence has now shifted to online platforms, allowing individuals from different corners of the world to connect and form relationships. Websites and agencies specializing in international matchmaking have proliferated, offering a wide range of services to facilitate cross-border marriages.  Critics of the mail-order bride industry point to concerns regarding exploitation and human trafficking. Stories of women being deceived or coerced into marriage with strangers in foreign lands have raised ethical questions about the validity of such arrangements. While reputable agencies strive to uphold ethical standards and ensure the well-being of their clients, instances of abuse and deception underscore the need for increased regulation and oversight in this industry.  On the other hand, proponents of the mail-order bride industry argue that it can provide a legitimate avenue for individuals to find love and companionship across borders. For some women, marrying a foreign man offers opportunities for personal growth, economic stability, and a chance to escape challenging circumstances in their home countries. Likewise, men seeking partners through international matchmaking services often cite cultural differences and a desire for traditional family values as motivating factors.  The dynamics of the mail-order bride industry are also shaped by cultural norms and expectations. In some societies, the practice of arranged or facilitated marriages is accepted and even encouraged as a means of strengthening familial and social ties. The concept of marriage as a contract between families, rather than just between individuals, plays a significant role in shaping the dynamics of international matchmaking.  As the mail-order bride industry continues to evolve, there is a growing emphasis on transparency, consent, and empowerment. Responsible agencies prioritize the safety and well-being of their clients, offering support services, background checks, and legal guidance to ensure that both parties enter into marriage agreements willingly and knowingly. Education and awareness campaigns aimed at dispelling myths and stereotypes surrounding mail-order brides also play a crucial role in shaping public perception.  Ultimately, the mail-order bride industry remains a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that reflects the intersection of love, economics, culture, and technology. While it offers opportunities for individuals to find companionship and build meaningful relationships across borders, it also raises important questions about power dynamics, agency, and ethical considerations. By examining the dynamics of this industry through a critical lens and advocating for ethical practices and regulations, we can work towards creating a more equitable and respectful environment for all individuals involved.""","641"
"6207","""-to determine, experimentally, the solubility product of Potassium Periodate and study the effects of salting in and salting out on the molar solubility. Background:- there exists a heterogeneous equilibrium between a saturated solution of a slightly soluble salt, MX, in contact with excess solid. The equilibrium constant for the equilibrium between the undissolved salt and its ions in a saturated solution is known as the solubility product, Ks, and like any equilibrium constant is the same at any one temperature. The concentration of the anion and cation are equal and are aknown as the molar solubility, s. Salting Out:- this refers to the common ion effect by which the solubility of the salt is reduced by the addition of a common ion of concentration, c, of M+ ions, for example. For the equilibrium constant to remain the same, must decrease and hence the molar solubility, which can now be called s': Salting In:- this refers to the inert ion effect by which the solubility of the salt increases by addition of other ions due to ionic interactions. For example, the removal of M- ions by a cation would lead to, according to Le Chatelier's Principle, the generation of more M- ions to oppose the change. The effects can be quantitatively described in terms of activity co-efficients for each ion. The true thermodynamics solubility, ksth, is the quantity which is truly constant at any one defined temperature: For dilute solutions, there are few interactions between ions and so the effects can be ignored to one, ksth tends to ks. However, for solutions between.1M and.M, the value of the activity co-efficients are more or less independent of the nature of the electrolyte be calculated from the Debye-Huckel limiting law equation: For concentrations above this, (a+ -) can be approximated by considering the mean value of the activity co-efficients for several similar electrolytes. Procedure:- Sodium made up to 5/80ml with distilled water and a trace amount of sodium carbonate added. A 5/8ml portion of this solution was then extracted and made up to 5/80ml. Three stoppered bottles were labelled A-C, and into each, potassium added with, in bottle A, distilled in C, potassium shaken vigorously for minutes before allowing to settle. At this point the temperatures were noted. each solution was then filtered and a 5/8ml portion taken for titration. This sample was then treated with potassium iodide and sulphuric acid to liberate the iodine. Solutions A and B were titrated against the more concentrated sodium solution C against the more dilute(.9910^-M). The iodine acted as an indicator, turning the solution from red-brown to colourless when it had all reacted. Each sample was repeatedly titrated until concordant results were achieved and a mean titre calculated. Results:- Calculations:- Errors:- Conclusion:- the true thermodynamic solubility product of potassium periodate at room temperature was found to be approximately.1810^- (this was the average value taken from our three solutions). It is this product which is said to be truly constant at any one temperature regardless of the environment as it takes into account the interactions between ions in solution. Our results strongly support this, deviating only very slightly from the mean, whereas the solubility product, ks, has a much greater standard deviation, varying for different solutions. It is important to note that our three solutions were filtered when at slightly different temperatures which may have led to the discrepancy in ksth. Our results also demonstrate very well the effects of both salting in and out as mentioned before. When other ions were introduced they reacted with the dissolved salt ions, removing them from the established equilibrium and hence forcing further generation (solubilization). This was illustrated by the rise in concentration of salt ions in solution B and demonstrates 'salting in'. Solution C introduced common ions which pushed the equilibrium towards the solid salt, lowering the concentration of iodate ions and hence the solubility decreased - an example of 'salting out'.""","""Solubility product of Potassium Periodate""","855","""Potassium periodate, with the chemical formula KIO4, is a fascinating compound that plays a significant role in chemistry due to its solubility product. Solubility product, often denoted as Ksp, is a constant that defines the equilibrium between a solid compound dissociating into its constituent ions in a solution. In the case of potassium periodate, understanding its solubility product is crucial for various applications in analytical chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and research.  When potassium periodate dissolves in water, it dissociates into its respective ions: potassium ions (K+) and periodate ions (IO4-). This dissociation leads to the equilibrium equation KIO4(s) ⇌ K+(aq) + IO4-(aq). The solubility product constant, Ksp, is the product of the concentrations of these ions in a saturated solution of potassium periodate. Mathematically, Ksp = [K+][IO4-].  Determining the solubility product of potassium periodate involves experimental methods to measure the concentrations of the ions in a saturated solution. By knowing these concentrations, one can calculate the Ksp value, which indicates the compound's solubility in water. The Ksp value is a crucial parameter as it helps predict the formation of precipitates when solutions are mixed.  The solubility product of potassium periodate can vary depending on factors such as temperature, pH, and presence of other ions in the solution. Changes in these conditions can affect the equilibrium between the solid compound and its ions in solution, consequently altering the Ksp value. For example, an increase in temperature can often lead to higher solubility of a compound, potentially changing its Ksp value.  In analytical chemistry, the solubility product of potassium periodate is utilized in various titration methods to determine the concentration of certain ions in a sample solution. By understanding the Ksp of potassium periodate and its behavior in solution, chemists can design precise and accurate analytical procedures for quantitative analysis.  The pharmaceutical industry also benefits from understanding the solubility product of compounds like potassium periodate. Knowledge of a compound's solubility characteristics is crucial in drug formulation and development, as it influences factors such as bioavailability and stability of pharmaceutical products.  Research applications of the solubility product of potassium periodate extend to fields like environmental chemistry, where it may be used in studies related to water quality, pollutant analysis, and understanding chemical reactions in aquatic systems. By studying the solubility behavior of potassium periodate, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of similar compounds and their interactions in solution.  In conclusion, the solubility product of potassium periodate is a fundamental concept in chemistry with practical implications in various industries and research fields. By investigating the equilibrium between the solid compound and its ions in solution, scientists can unravel the complex behavior of compounds like potassium periodate and apply this knowledge to enhance analytical techniques, pharmaceutical formulations, and environmental studies. Understanding the solubility product of potassium periodate opens up avenues for further exploration and innovation in the vast realm of chemistry.""","621"
"179","""From the late 9 th century and early 0 th century labour-capital relations began to undergo fundamental changes. In 911 Frederick Taylor published 'The Principles of Scientific Management' It was an attempt to document some of these changes, as well as spread these ideas more widely. It is from this book that the concept of Taylorism evolved. Key to the question is that Taylorism was different to what had come before, and that it came about for specific economic reasons. This essay will try to explain what Taylorism is, where it came from, and why it came into any kind of existence at all. When Taylor published his book he believed that the working man had a natural tendency to 'soldiering' This meant that workers did less work than they were physically able to means that the management takes away the conceptual thought process involved in Taylor sees workers as inherently should be broken down to their simplest possible components. These methods were clearly taken up by Ford in his new factories where various ready-made jigsaws and later machines meant that work was deskilled and mentally 'putting out system' and early factory work were all capitalist control methods. First controlling the product, then when the labour was done, and Taylorism was the final development of how work should be is a functional organisational change, the relationship within large corporations between workers and between labour and capital remains similar. Clearly Braverman disagrees with this, as he sees Taylorism creating a more systematically exploitative relationship, as the capitalist no longer has to rely on workers' prior skills and knowledge. As work practices become codified then the connection between employer and employee by becomes more bureaucratic. Traditional 'rule of thumb' practices are replaced with 'legal'-rational written instructions. Maybe the relationship has not in its nature changed so much as evolved to a higher form. It was not the shift from an idealistic craft scenario that Braverman envisaged being consumed by deskilling, but nevertheless skill was taken from the 'shop floor' labourers into the 'planning department' (Taylor:911:Chapter ). The rationalization of control of work that Littler writes of by its nature changes the relationship between worker and employer, to a more formal and depersonalised one. Having briefly dealt with the nature of the relationship between employer and employee, it still remains to discover why Taylorism was created. As has already been evidenced Taylorism positions itself neatly into a teleological view of the development of capitalism: it was only a matter of time before capitalists extended their hand to have more control over how work was done. This control was rational, and Weber sees society as rationalizing and 'abandoning god' for conclusion this essay agrees with the question. Taylorism was a new form of relationship, it was both exploitive, bureaucratized, deskilling and formalising. It was developed because of large corporations need for concentrated power in order to reduce costs and increase profit. Taylorism has developed since its conceptualisation, but such a discussion would require a different question.""","""Taylorism and labor-capital relations""","611","""Taylorism, named after Frederick Winslow Taylor, is a system of scientific management developed in the late 19th century that aimed to increase productivity and efficiency in the workplace. This approach revolutionized industrial manufacturing by breaking down tasks into small, repetitive motions, standardizing work processes, and measuring workers' performance to optimize output.  At its core, Taylorism emphasizes the division of labor and the separation of mental and manual tasks. Workers are expected to perform specific, repetitive actions with little autonomy, as the focus is on maximizing efficiency and output. This method became widely adopted during the Industrial Revolution, particularly in factories where mass production was essential.  While Taylorism succeeded in increasing productivity, it also sparked debates about its impact on labor-capital relations. Critics argue that this approach dehumanizes workers, treating them as mere cogs in a machine rather than valuing their skills and expertise. Taylorism's strict emphasis on efficiency often leads to workers feeling alienated and disengaged from their work, which can negatively impact job satisfaction and employee morale.  Moreover, Taylorism is criticized for its potential to exploit workers by prioritizing profits over their well-being. The piece-rate system, where workers are paid based on their output, can incentivize speed over quality and push employees to work at an unsustainable pace to earn a living wage. This exploitative aspect of Taylorism highlights the power dynamics between labor and capital, where workers may be at a disadvantage due to the emphasis on maximizing profits.  On the other hand, proponents of Taylorism argue that it leads to improved production methods, quality control, and overall efficiency in the workplace. By streamlining processes and optimizing workflows, businesses can achieve cost savings and competitive advantages in the market. This efficiency-driven approach can also benefit workers by potentially creating more job opportunities and increasing overall economic growth.  In modern times, Taylorism's principles have evolved to include concepts like lean manufacturing and continuous improvement, which focus on eliminating waste and empowering employees to contribute ideas for efficiency gains. Companies now strive to balance productivity goals with employee well-being and job satisfaction to foster a more harmonious labor-capital relationship.  Overall, the impact of Taylorism on labor-capital relations remains a complex and ongoing discussion. While it has undoubtedly reshaped the way we approach work and productivity, balancing the need for efficiency with respect for workers' rights and dignity is essential for sustainable and equitable labor practices in today's society.""","479"
"3015","""Many companies that have decided to follow the trend of business globalisation had to realise that their expatriates, who were responsible for starting the business, were not trained enough to perform in the assignments successfully. Yet, despite this, organisations have failed to recognise the importance of cross-cultural training. Which inevitably lead to the loss of business, customers and suppliers, because the expatriate was unable to adapt to the host countries culture. These issues will be discussed in more detail and examples will be shown of how organisations can overcome the failure of expatriate managers. Particular attention is paid to expatriates from international hotel organisations in China and what skills these managers need to have in order to be successful in this fast expanding business environment. Keywords: Cross-cultural training, China, Hospitality Industry, Culture shock MethodologyThis article is based on secondary research, which has several advantages over primary research as suggested by Stewart and Kamins who states: 'Secondary sources provide a useful starting point for additional research by suggesting problem formulations, research hypothesis, and research methods. Consultation of secondary sources provides a means for increasing the efficiency of the research dollar by targeting real gaps and oversights in knowledge' (Stewart and Kamins 993, p5/8). In this way, extensive secondary research from books, journals, the Internet and electronic databases have been obtained to get a good understanding and knowledge of the article topic.The importance of international human resource management has dramatically increased over the last 0 long been isolated from the outside world. It was only after 979 under the leadership of Hua Guo-Feng and later Deng Xiao-Ping that it opened it doors to foreign visitors, tourists and foreign companies, which planned to expand their business in this so far undiscovered part of the be a long gruelling process, which often results in the other hand, identify strategic awareness, customer focus, individual responsibility, communication skills and creativity as very important qualities. One of the most interesting approaches about the competencies for international managers in recent years was developed by Wills and Barham. The study was based on a survey, which involved 0 senior international executives from a range of different countries and industries. The study revealed that the overall competencies were composed of three inter-linking parts; cognitive complexity, emotional energy and psychological maturity (Figure ). The cognitive complexity competency includes features such as, cultural empathy, active listening and sense of humility. Emotional energy includes, emotional self-awareness, emotional resilience, risk acceptance and emotional support of the family. Psychological maturity includes, curiosity to learn, orientation to time and personal morality. These competencies identified by Wills and Barham differentiates totally from the other criteria's used to identify the actual selection decisions within organisations. Harris and Kumra argue that organisations rely on more traditional criteria's such as, technical expertise and knowledge of the company systems rather then 'soft' skills. The high risk factor companies face when sending expatriates on international assignments could explain this approach. Organisations want to get the job done competently by expatriates who have proven themselves through recorded measures of attainment. Ruben stresses that such an approach is the determinant for failure rather than the key to success. Expatriates need to able to built relationships and respect the traditions of the host country in order to be successful. One that thinks building relationships is a waste of time and who is more interested in getting the job done is determined to fail. Especially in country such as China with its long tradition and beliefs can such an approach be devastating for the business. Webb for example points out, 'Conducting business in a different culture requires adaptation to the value systems and norms of that country. Respecting another culture and its customs and etiquette is not only good manners but also good business' (Webb 996, p41). It is therefore important that international human resource managers recognise the need for more 'soft' skills when selecting the right expatriate candidate for the international assignments. Simply relying on technical skills or previous work experience cannot be the way to success. Cultural ImplicationsOne of the most influential writers in the area of national culture and what impact it has on the way people manage and work together in organisation is Geert Hofstede (Groeschl and Doherty 000). His book 'Cultural Consequences', first published in 980, was based on survey involving employees and managers from IBM in 0 countries (later extended to over 0 countries). Hofstede defines culture as 'the collective programming of the mind that distinguishes the members of one group or category of people from another' (Hofstede 001, p9). The survey found that 'national culture explained more of the differences in work-related values than did an individual's position within the organisation, profession, age or gender' (Barham and Oates 991, p45/8). Hofstede's findings suggest that national cultures can be divided in four dimensions: individualism versus collectivism; uncertainty avoidance; and masculinity versus femininity. These four dimensions provide a useful characterisation of Chinese culture (Table ). It is important for companies to understand these cultural influences in order to create an international spirit within the organisation. Kaye and Taylor for example argue that communication plays a significant role in the Chinese culture, and Western expatriates need to have basic knowledge of the Chinese language. This view is supported by Selmer who argues, 'Not being able to interact with the host country nationals in daily life makes expatriates ignorant about local thinking and character which influences their ability to assess work situations and make them develop wrong assumptions about people they are managing' (Selmer 000, p16). Culture shock Many factors can contribute to the feeling of homesickness and culture shock when starting an international assignment. Adler defines culture shock as 'the expatriates reaction to a new, unpredictable, and therefore uncertain environment'(Adler 997, p264). This is further developed by Kaye and Taylor who state, 'Differences in expectations, language, foods, ways to eat, the concept of personal space, etc., are often stress producing because they may seem neither understandable nor ethically 'correct'' (Kaye and Taylor 997, p497). Even the most effective experienced expatriate managers often suffer from severe culture shock (Adler 997). Adler argues that the adjustment of the expatriate to the new culture can be described in the form of a U-shaped curve (Figure ). It starts with the honeymoon stage were the expatriate manager experiences a great deal of excitement in the initial stage of the assignment, which is then followed, by a stage of disillusionment. This stage is characterised by starting to blame others for the expatriate's problems instead of understanding and recognising that this not useful no matter how tempting it is. The bottom of the curve is marked by the culture shock phase, which is the result from too many new and meaningless clues. Simons et.al. identifies three responses to culture shock; resistance: the rejection of the new culture and a powerful defence of one's own tradition; assimilation: the complete rejection of one's own values in order to embrace those for the new culture and; acculturation: learning to live with the new culture while remaining rooted in the traditions of one's own. After this phase has been overcome the expatriate starts to adapt to the new culture and feels more positive, works more effectively and lives his/her life more satisfactorily. The culture shock phase is the stage when expatriates decide not to continue their international assignments, because of differences between the home and host countries culture of the individual of which he/she is not able to deal with. Mendenhall et.al. states, '.many expatriates never get beyond the culture shock stage, and either return home early from their assignments or simply 'gut it out' and complete their assignments but are never completely effective in their assignments or happy about living in the host culture' (Mendenhall et.al. 995/8, p412). Expatriate managers from international hotel chains however; seem to experience fewer problems during their assignments then other expatriate managers. That does not mean there are no problems, but the expatriates are somehow more excited about their assignments. Gliatis and Guerrier for example state, '.hotel companies experience fewer problems in the management of international assignments than many other multinational companies. They attract managers who are enthusiastic about an international career and have developed ways of managing careers on a global basis' (Gliatis and Guerrier 994, p239). However, problems like cultural differences, local staff attitude, lack of local staff competence and government policy changes persist and were perceived the most difficult ones by expatriate managers who work for international hotel companies in China (Feng and Pearson 999). It is therefore necessary that expatriate managers receive adequate cross cultural training before starting their assignments in China in order to overcome these problems. Cross - Cultural TrainingThe literature on cross-cultural training and its contribution to the performance improvements of expatriate managers is extensive (Hodgetts and Luthans 000; Barham 989; Mendenhall et.al. 995/8; Harris and Kumra 000). Cross-cultural training is believed to have an impact on the expatriate's productivity and for generating greater satisfaction in their foreign assignments (Webb 996). The training is designed to help expatriates with the adaptation to the new culture and to teach appropriate behaviours that are necessary within the new culture. This includes for example, gradual development of familiarity, comfort and proficiency in dealing with the expected behaviour, values and assumptions inherent in the new culture (Webb 996, p41). It also seeks to provide information and guidance by using for instance, cultural specific trainings, assimilators, readings, films, role-plays, case studies and interactive language training (Harris and Kumra 000; Mendenhall et.al. 995/8). The culture assimilator for example, requires the trainee to respond to a number of given culture scenarios. The trainee learns here how to react in certain situations and to behave accordingly in the new culture. The assimilator gives also feedback on the trainee's performance (Mendenhall et.al. 995/8). However, in order to understand foreign cultural influences it is important first to understand one's own culture. Only than can the individual realise that that his/her culture or behaviour is not universal and starts to recognise other values and beliefs. There are three main theoretical frameworks for cross-cultural training, which are designed to test the expatriate's effectiveness. Each of these three models takes a slightly different approach. Tung's framework for example, identifies two main dimensions that should be used: the degree of interaction required in the host culture and also the similarities between the expatriates host home culture and the host culture. This framework was the first to outline the selection for cross-cultural training. Mendenhall and Oddon developed Tung's framework and included a more complex relationship between training method and the two variables. This framework assumed again a cultural specific orientation, but in addition indicated that a mix of experiential training might be appropriate for the expatriate depending on the level of rigour required. The last framework for the selection of cross-cultural training for expatriates was developed by Black and Mendenhall (Please see Figure ). This model is based on a social learning theory. It clearly links the variables of culture novelty, the required degree of contact with the host nationals, job novelty and the greater need for cross-cultural training. Mendenhall et.al. notes that, '.each of these three dimensions are not equal; research suggests that adjusting to the host culture and interacting with host nationals are more difficult tasks than adjusting to the overseas job'(Mendenhall et.al. 995/8, 5/81). While these models are well known amongst academics, few human resource managers actually use them, which can be the result of various reasons. Some managers may think that the training is a waste of time and ineffective, others can simple not afford the training expenses. One factor that needs considering however, is that the frameworks, developed by Tung and others, did not include any hospitality organisations. This aspect is critical as the hospitality industry requires more relation skills and expatriate managers must understand the host countries culture in order to deal with a diverse customer base. In a study conducted by Shay and Tracey only 5/8 percent of the expatriate managers working in the hospitality industry had received cross-cultural training upon their arrival, which shows that the use of these frameworks is not much used in practise. The authors suggest therefore, to apply a rather different approach for cross-cultural training programs, which delineates objective and subjective characteristics of culture. This would help managers to '. understand what to expect in their daily routine and the social dynamics they will encounter. The information should create an awareness of the general dimensions on which cultures differ and the likely effect of the differences on expatriates'(Shay and Tracey 997, p34). Feng and Pearson also stress the importance of cross-cultural training for hotel expatriates. From their point of view is the understanding of the Chinese culture as well as stress management the most important factors managers need to consider when selecting expatriates for international hotel assignments. Therefore, the failure to provide expatriates with cross-cultural training leads inevitably to the culture shock phase were the individuals is unable to cope with the cultural influences and behaviours of the host country. ConclusionThis research has shown that much of the reasons for the high percentage of expatriate failure in foreign assignments starts of with poor selection in the early stages of the recruitment process. Many international human resource managers rely on 'hard' technical skills and previous work experience, rather than selecting candidates who have skills in building long lasting business relationships and who are culturally aware. It is these skills however, that are needed when working in a country, such as China, which is totally influenced by its old traditions and beliefs. Expatriates that will not be able to adjust to the new host culture will be more likely to fail in their assignments than someone who has received cross-cultural training. Especially expatriates from international hotel companies need to be aware of the new culture and the way people behave and feel, as it is important to comprehend the needs of a diverse customer base. Unfortunately the use of cross-cultural training selection methods is not widely spread across the industry and many managers believe that the training is a waste of time and money. This belief being a misconception was shown in this research, which showed that the investment in cross-cultural training could have saved many companies millions of dollars. Therefore, managers from the hospitality and other industries, that consider expanding their business in China, need to recognise the need for adequate cross-cultural training for their expatriates. Its not only the responsibility of hospitality schools to contribute to the fair share of global hospitality managers, but also every company that acts globally (Kriegl 000). It will cost money, time and effort, but no company in this increasingly global environment can afford to fail to invest in the skills of their expatriates, because the next competitor is just around the corner, ready to live up to the challenge. RecommendationsAlthough the literature provides many examples on the cross-cultural training theory, statistics or case studies on how the training improves the performance of expatriates in the real life environment is almost non-existent. Therefore, more research is needed in this area.""","""Expatriate cross-cultural training challenges""","3154","""Expatriate Cross-Cultural Training Challenges  Expatriate cross-cultural training is a vital aspect of preparing employees for international assignments. As companies expand globally, the need for employees to work in different countries grows, making cross-cultural training an essential component of their preparation. Despite its importance, expatriate cross-cultural training comes with various challenges that organizations must address to ensure the success of their international assignments.  One significant challenge in expatriate cross-cultural training is the diversity of cultures that employees may encounter. Different countries have varying cultural norms, values, communication styles, and business practices. Therefore, training programs must cover a wide range of cultural aspects to provide expatriates with a comprehensive understanding of the new culture they will be working in. This requires extensive research and expertise to develop training programs that effectively address the nuances of each culture.  Language barriers also pose a significant challenge in expatriate cross-cultural training. Effective communication is crucial for building relationships, negotiating business deals, and understanding local customs. Expatriates who do not speak the local language may struggle to communicate effectively, leading to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Language training programs need to be tailored to the specific needs of each expatriate to help them develop the language skills required for their assignment.  Another challenge in expatriate cross-cultural training is the adjustment to a new work environment. Expatriates may face difficulties adapting to different work practices, organizational structures, and management styles. They may find it challenging to navigate hierarchical systems, decision-making processes, and expectations regarding work hours and work-life balance. Training programs should address these differences and provide expatriates with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in their new work environment.  Cultural differences in business etiquette and communication styles also present challenges in expatriate cross-cultural training. For example, some cultures value direct communication and assertiveness, while others prioritize indirect communication and harmony. Expatriates need to understand these cultural nuances to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts in the workplace. Training programs should include role-playing exercises, case studies, and simulations to help expatriates practice navigating cultural differences in business interactions.  Managing cultural shock and homesickness is another challenge that expatriates may face during their international assignments. Moving to a new country, away from family and familiar surroundings, can be emotionally challenging. Expatriates may experience feelings of isolation, loneliness, and cultural disorientation. Cross-cultural training programs should prepare expatriates for the psychological aspects of living and working abroad, provide strategies for coping with cultural shock, and offer support networks to help them adjust to their new environment.  Measuring the effectiveness of expatriate cross-cultural training is a significant challenge for organizations. It can be challenging to evaluate the impact of training programs on expatriates' performance, job satisfaction, and retention. Organizations need to develop metrics and assessment tools to track the outcomes of cross-cultural training and make adjustments based on feedback from expatriates. Continuous evaluation and improvement of training programs are essential to ensure that they meet the evolving needs of expatriates and the organization.  In conclusion, expatriate cross-cultural training poses various challenges that organizations must address to support the success of their international assignments. From cultural diversity and language barriers to work environment adjustment and business etiquette, expatriates face a multitude of obstacles when working in a foreign country. Effective training programs that are tailored to the specific needs of expatriates can help them navigate these challenges and adapt to their new cultural environment. By recognizing and addressing these challenges, organizations can enhance the effectiveness of their expatriate assignments and ultimately achieve their global business objectives.""","718"
"64","""Procedural IssuesBefore considering the substantive arguments for judicial review, there are a number of procedural issues to address. The Exclusivity Principle requires that claims for judicial review be brought by judicial review procedure rather than ordinary civil procedure. Although the special judicial review procedure has been criticised, and the Exclusivity Principle diluted, it is still considered an abuse of process to avoid the procedural protections afforded to public bodies under judicial review. Firstly, is the school disciplinary panel susceptible to review? Only 'public bodies' can be judicially reviewed. Statutory powers are presumptively public. A state school is a classic governmental body with statutory source and public functions. The decisions are suitable for judicial review as they adversely affect the individuals concerned. Secondly, permission to apply for judicial review requires: Standing: in order to avoid the courts becoming lobby grounds, judicial review is restricted to those with a 'sufficient interest' in challenging the decision. The decision must affect the applicant's rights or interests As being excluded from school directly affects the applicants, this requirement is met. Given their age, it may be more realistic to consider the standing of their parents. Parents would be 'surrogate' representatives, an uncontroversial means of protecting the rights of those who cannot easily access the forum of judicial review. The applicants would also satisfy the stricter 'victim' test for review under the Human Rights Act. Following Holub, their parents would also have standing to challenge the school under the Human Rights Act. No undue delay: In addition to the much-criticised month time limit for judicial review applications, applicants are faced with the added difficulty that any perceived 'undue delay' in bringing the action may lead to the claim being struck out even if it is made within months. This uncertainty means that the only clear advice that can be given to the applicants is to ensure that they apply as soon as possible. Arguable case: The merits of the case are considered at the permission stage as well as during the substantive hearing. Although justified to filter out frivolous claims, this can lead to a fusion of questions of standing with issues of merits, which might more appropriately be considered at a later stage. Again the discretionary nature of judicial decision-making makes it difficult to predict whether the applicants would be adjudged as having arguable cases, however, these are allegations of serious administrative errors based on well-structured grounds of review. The question of an arguable case is also central to an application for interim relief. This may be appropriate to the students, given that they would suffer a lack of schooling during the course of proceedings. The damage which may be caused in the interim is particularly significant to Y, who is approaching her GCSEs. Substantive IssuesIf the applicants overcome these procedural hurdles, their substantive arguments will be tested. From the start the court will take into account the remedy being sought, as this is relevant to the balancing of public and private interests which is central to judicial review. As the decisions in this case are easily reversible, the prerogative quashing order may be appropriate. Alternatively, they could seek a mandatory order of readmission, or, if X and Z have already found a new school, they may simply desire a declaration of unlawfulness. XOn automatic expulsion for a second positive test for cannabis, X argues: That it was unfair for the panel not to consider a medical report suggesting that the drug may have remained in his system since the first test. This raises issues of illegality and irrationality as well as procedural impropriety. In relation to procedural impropriety, 'fairness' is often used synonymously with 'natural justice' when the decisions are made in an everyday administrative context such as this. The term is flexible. In a broad sense it requires a balancing of the individual interests at stake, the benefits to be gained by following the correct procedure and the costs of complying. The protection applies to decision-making which affects the rights and interests of individuals, therefore the panel's power to expel X, impacting on a very important interest, is subject to these rules. It remains to be considered whether the rules of fairness have been breached. In refusing to consider the medical report, it is arguable that X was denied a fair hearing. A duty to provide a hearing applies whenever an individual may suffer detriment as a result of a decision, and is most stringently applied where the sanction imposed would deprive a person of his livelihood - a close analogy can be drawn with expulsion from school, which has long-term effects on education and career. As the requirements of a fair hearing vary according to the circumstances, an oral hearing and strict rules of evidence may not apply For reasons of time and cost, judicial review procedure places limits on the exploration of disputed factual matters. Therefore, X's broad entitlement to a hearing may not extend as far as the right to introduce the medical report. On the other hand, given that the school's policy specifically provides for a hearing, this may engender a legitimate expectation of a protection going beyond the minimal requirement. The statement of policy is clear, it is promised to only a few people, and compliance with it would not place too onerous a burden on the panel. There may be grey areas in the doctrine of legitimate expectations, however, in general procedural expectations such as this one are most likely to be upheld. The panel may, of course, argue that they did not fail to consider the medical report; rather, due to its apparent inconclusiveness, they simply decided not to attach such weight to it as to consider it in any detail. For the court to review the panel's discretionary judgment of the report would be to risk infringing the fundamental constitutional principle that 'judicial review is concerned with the decision-making process not the decision.' X needs to take care to steer his action away from merits review, framing it in terms of natural justice or error of law for wrongfully excluding evidence. There is no room for judicial review to admit new evidence. Finally, the panel may contend that consideration of the report would have made no difference. Case law suggests that this is not an excuse, as the reviewing court is not is a position to work out whether hearing the evidence would have made any difference; however, as remedies are discretionary, the court may refuse to grant one if the result would have been the same regardless of the breach of natural justice. That the policy of automatic expulsion for a second positive test is irrational/ disproportionate. This is effectively asking the court to substitute its own view on the merits the policy for that of the school, something which they are reluctant to do both due to a lack of institutional competence to deal with polycentric issues and concerns at the constitutional impropriety of interfering with political decision-making. However, reviewing courts will show limited deference to a subordinate decision, such as that of the school.. That the policy-maker in this case lacks direct democratic accountability further diminishes the degree of deference owed by the court. Administrative law increasingly considers substantive as well as procedural issues. In relation to irrationality, the Wednesbury unreasonableness test comes close to a merits review. The traditional Wednesbury test was set so high that it would be of little assistance to X. The school could provide a rational justification for the policy, for example sending out a strict message of no-tolerance on drugs. Yet aside from the more stringent proportionality test, irrationality has evolved since Wednesbury: ex parte Smith emphasises the need for a stricter standard of review when individual rights are concerned. X's right to attend school is an important one; therefore the panel may find it difficult to justify a policy which automatically disregards this. In a human rights context, proportionality rather than Wednesbury unreasonableness is the applicable test. As a public body, the state school must act compatibly with Convention rights. X's right to education is presumptively protected. Proportionality considers whether the means used to achieve a legitimate goal infringe the individual's rights more than is necessary. As in this case, clashing protective rights must be balanced against each other. Arguably it would be difficult to protect other pupils by a lesser measure, however, proportionality jurisprudence does not look favourably on blanket policies. Even if it is not deemed irrational, X may object to the policy under the overlapping ground of illegality. It is unlawful for an authority to fetter its discretion, which is the result of a rigid policy which allows no exceptions and precludes the decision-maker from taking relevant considerations into account. On a second positive test, the school's policy of automatic expulsion is absolutely rigid, allowing for no exceptions to the sanction. YSuspended for a term after a positive test for cannabis, Y alleges that the panel was biased because: Y had previously made a complaint about the behaviour of one of the teachers. Y can argue that this teacher would not provide her with a fair and impartial hearing. There is no need to show actual victimisation; appearance of bias is enough. Porter v Magill requires the reviewing court to consider whether, having regard to relevant circumstances, the fair-minded and impartial observer would consider that there was a 'real possibility' of bias. We would need to know more about the circumstances of the complaint and Y's relationship with this teacher. For example, how long ago was the complaint made? How serious a complaint was it? The fact that the complaint was dismissed is not necessarily relevant as the very fact that Y complained may be perceived as giving rise to animosity on the part of the teacher. Personal animosity may result in disqualification for bias, however, the courts are less strict in their approach to non-financial connections. It has been held that mere personal prejudice arising from a previous dispute is not enough to set aside a decision for bias, therefore Y would have to show that the animosity resulting from the complaint was particularly strong. Y could argue that having a panel of teachers is prima facie unfair. It may raise questions of personal and institutional bias as well as the problem of the same person playing the role of policy-maker, prosecutor and adjudicator. One panel member is a well-known anti-drugs campaigner. This raises issues of predetermination and having an interest in the outcome. Again, Porter v Magill applies: would an independent observer would perceive bias? The Pinochet case provides an analogy, however, judges are not precluded from sitting on cases unless they have an active role in a body closely allied to the proceedings. The anti-drugs group would no doubt disapprove of Y's conduct, and the fact that the teacher is a well-known campaigner indicates that he plays an active role in the group, however, there is no evidence that this group was involved in Y's hearing or that they promote a policy of exclusion of students with drug problems. Pinochet may therefore be distinguished. A third panel member fell asleep during the hearing. Procedural unfairness would arise even if the teacher only appeared to be asleep or was simply not paying attention. This breaches the right to be heard. It is linked to the issue of bias and keeping an open mind. Finally, it should be noted that a finding of bias on the part of just one panel member will usually invalidate the whole panel, as it cannot be known how this member would have influenced the others. This means that there is a strong chance of the decision being overturned. Furthermore, the courts are receptive to procedural arguments as there is less risk of them overstepping their constitutional role of supervising rather than making policy. Y could, however, object to the panel's decision on more substantive grounds. The decision to suspend her for a whole term may be irrational/disproportionate. Given the seriousness of the impact on Y so close to her GCSEs, and the fact that cannabis is not a serious drug, we might question whether a fair balance was struck. We would need to know more about Y's circumstances, for example whether she was a dealer. However, if the panel failed to take relevant considerations into account or attached unreasonable weight to irrelevant considerations, this is an unlawful abuse of discretion. It is in circumstances such as this that a duty to give reasons would be helpful. ZZ objects to being given the maximum sanction of expulsion for a first positive test. This engages the overlapping grounds of irrationality and illegality. In terms of irrationality, cocaine is a serious drug, but was expulsion a reasonable, proportionate response? The panel's rigid commitment to the policy guidance may have caused them to attach disproportionate weight to the single factor of the seriousness of the drug. Z frames his action in illegality, arguing that the panel's decision was based on irrelevant considerations and improper purposes. The courts are now quite activist in relation to abuse of discretionary powers, however, the onus of proof is on the applicant, and, without the giving of reasons, this could be a difficult task. Even if Z can show that the panel took his grades into account, this is not necessarily an irrelevant consideration. Although not mentioned in the policy guidance, the school may consider that Z's poor grades are a result of his drug problem. A reviewing court would be reluctant to substitute its own view on the merits of this consideration. In relation to Z's second argument, bad faith is difficult to prove. If it can be shown that dismissing Z was merely a sham in order to close down the course, or even that this was a material influence, then such fraudulent bad faith makes the decision unlawful. However, the tenuous and speculative nature of this allegation makes it difficult to prove. Although the safety of other students is a weighty interest, depending on his other circumstances, Z may have a better chance if he grounds his action in irrationality/proportionality. AppealIf an appeal process is available, an application for judicial review will usually, although not always, only be granted if this avenue has been exhausted. If there is an appeal, lower standards may be expected of the original decision-maker. Procedural defects may be considered 'cured' by an appeal. In Y's case, a hearing before an impartial Local Authority board may 'cure' any initial bias. In X's case, a full rehearing may be necessary in order for the procedure as a whole to be considered fair. For Z, the Local Authority may present the same problem of financial bias. In all cases, the existence of an appeal presents a powerful argument to impose a duty to give reasons for the decisions as it would be difficult to frame an effective appeal without reasons. RemediesDue to the discretionary nature of judicial review remedies a predictable outcome cannot be guaranteed. A quashing order may not be granted if the panel would have come to the same decision even if it had acted properly. The court may also take extraneous factors such as the applicant's behaviour into account. It may consider the applicant to have waived his right to a remedy: this may be of relevance to Y if she knew of the alleged bias at the time of her hearing but only objected when the decision went against her. A source of both flexibility and uncertainty, public law remedies capture the essence of judicial review as a whole.

When schools enforce disciplinary actions against students, it is essential that the decisions made are reasonable, unbiased, and adhere to the principles of the law. Judicial review serves as a mechanism to scrutinize school disciplinary actions, assess whether the procedures followed were fair, and determine if the punishments imposed were appropriate. In this comprehensive exploration, we will delve into the significance of judicial review in school settings, the legal principles underlying it, the impact on students' rights, and the overall implications for the educational system.  Judicial review serves as a check and balance mechanism to oversee the decisions made by educational institutions when disciplining students. This process involves having a court review the administrative actions of schools to ensure that they comply with procedural fairness and adhere to the law. Through judicial review, courts can intervene in disciplinary cases to rectify any instances of procedural irregularities, arbitrariness, or bias that may have occurred during the disciplinary process. By subjecting school disciplinary actions to judicial scrutiny, the legal system upholds the rights of students to a fair and impartial hearing, thus protecting them from unjust or disproportionate punishments.  One of the key legal principles that underpin judicial review in school disciplinary actions is the concept of procedural due process. Procedural due process requires that individuals facing disciplinary actions are entitled to certain fundamental rights, such as the right to notice of the charges against them, the right to a hearing, the right to present evidence and witnesses, and the right to a decision based on the evidence presented. These procedural safeguards are essential for ensuring that students are treated fairly and that disciplinary decisions are made based on reliable information and proper legal standards.  When schools fail to adhere to procedural due process requirements in their disciplinary proceedings, the affected students can seek redress through judicial review. Courts have the authority to review the actions of schools, assess whether procedural safeguards were followed, and determine if any violations of due process occurred. If a court finds that a student's rights were infringed or that the disciplinary action was unfair, it may overturn the decision, order a new hearing, or provide other forms of relief to protect the student's rights. This demonstrates the critical role that judicial review plays in upholding the principles of due process and ensuring justice in school disciplinary matters.  In addition to procedural fairness, judicial review also safeguards students' substantive rights in school disciplinary actions. Substantive due process protections require that disciplinary decisions are based on legitimate reasons, are not arbitrary or capricious, and do not infringe on fundamental rights without a valid justification. When schools impose disciplinary sanctions, they must ensure that the punishments are proportionate to the misconduct, consider any mitigating circumstances, and do not violate students' constitutional rights. Through judicial review, courts can evaluate the substantive fairness of disciplinary actions and intervene if they find that the school's decision was unjust or violated the student's substantive rights.  The impact of judicial review in school disciplinary actions extends beyond individual cases and has broader implications for the educational system as a whole. By subjecting school discipline to legal scrutiny, judicial review encourages schools to act in accordance with the law, follow established procedures, and respect students' rights. This oversight helps to promote accountability, transparency, and consistency in the disciplinary process, ultimately enhancing the integrity of the educational institution. Moreover, judicial review serves as a deterrent against arbitrary or unjust disciplinary actions, as schools are aware that their decisions can be challenged in court if they fail to uphold the principles of due process and fairness.  Furthermore, judicial review in school disciplinary matters promotes a culture of respect for the rule of law and constitutional rights within educational institutions. By holding schools accountable for their disciplinary actions and ensuring that students are afforded their due process rights, judicial review reinforces the principles of fairness, equality, and justice within the school environment. This can have a positive impact on students' perceptions of the legal system, their understanding of their rights, and their confidence in seeking redress when their rights are violated.  In practice, judicial review in school disciplinary actions involves students or their parents filing a legal challenge against the school's decision in a court of law. The court then reviews the case, examines the evidence, and assesses whether the school followed proper procedures and respected the student's rights. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the court may uphold the school's decision, remand the case for further review, or overturn the disciplinary action if it finds violations of due process or substantive rights. This process ensures that school disciplinary actions are subject to legal oversight and that students have a means of recourse if they believe their rights have been infringed.  It is important to note that while judicial review serves as a crucial safeguard against unfair or arbitrary disciplinary actions, courts generally defer to schools on matters of educational policy and discipline. Courts recognize the expertise of educators in maintaining discipline and order within schools and are hesitant to intervene in matters of academic judgment or school policy. However, when disciplinary actions implicate fundamental rights or the principles of due process, courts are empowered to review the decisions of schools and ensure that students are afforded their constitutional protections.  In conclusion, judicial review in school disciplinary actions is a fundamental mechanism for upholding the principles of due process, fairness, and justice in the educational setting. By subjecting school disciplinary decisions to legal scrutiny, judicial review protects students' rights, promotes accountability in educational institutions, and fosters a culture of respect for the rule of law. Through procedural and substantive oversight, courts play a critical role in ensuring that disciplinary actions are reasonable, lawful, and respectful of students' rights. As schools navigate the complexities of disciplining students, the presence of judicial review serves as a crucial safeguard to ensure that the rights and interests of students are upheld and protected in the pursuit of a safe and conducive learning environment.""","1184"

RESULTS - CALCULATIONSSteam DistillationWeight of the sample: 0.069 g Liquid-liquid extraction and isolation: Initial weight of the 5/80 ml round bottomed flask: 6.25/8 g Final weight of the 5/80 ml round bottomed flask: 8.76 g Difference in weight:.5/81 g in 0.069 g of sample So in 00 g of sample, we have.5/8 g eugenol =.5/8% Confirmation of Eugenol structure and Assessment of Purity Chemical test:We added drop of product to ml ethanolic ferric chloride Index:c) Infrared Spectrum:Below there is a typical infrared spectrum of Eugenol. The infrared spectrums for the standard solution and for the sample are attached. You can clearly observe the peaks that are representative of the phenol structure. The characteristic features for the spectrum have been marked on the attached sheets. Gas ChromatographyThe results obtained when using the gas chromatography method are attached for both the standard solution and the sample. We only had one peak after the peak of the solvent so we can assume that the sample contains only Eugenol. We can also observe two peaks where the solvent peak should be and this can be contributed to the presence of another solvent such as water. The retention the Eugenol standard was.37 while for the sample was.06. They are almost similar so we assume that our sample contains only Eugenol. We have only one peak so we don't have to calculate the percentage of Eugenol in our sample as we assume this is 00%. DISCUSSIONAn error that has altered our results when determining the percentage of Eugenol in the cloves is that from the 0.069 g of sample that was weighed, a very small amount could not be transferred into the distillation flask. Therefore, the result lower than the real value for Eugenol in the sample. It is known that freshly dried cloves contain about 4% of Eugenol. Our result value was far smaller than that, and this can be contributed to the fact that the cloves were not freshly dried, and had probably lost some of their aromatic character (by exposure to air). As for the result for the Refractive Index, we have a decline from the result that was from the standard solution and this can be contributed to a possible uncompleted evaporation of solvent using the rotary evaporator. The index of refraction normally decreases as the temperature increases for a liquid. For many organic liquids the index of refraction decreases by approximately.005/8 for every C increase in temperature. Common errors with refractometer measurements include failing to calibrate with distilled water and not making the necessary temperature corrections. The chemical Test confirmed that our product is a phenol. This was obvious from the blue color that was formed. The infrared spectrum confirmed the phenol structure, and the results from the gas chromatography have also confirmed that our sample is composed only by Eugenol. Limitations due to the uncertainty of the instruments also exist but we consider them as not significant when doing our calculations.""","""Eugenol extraction and characterization""","753","""Eugenol Extraction and Characterization  Eugenol, a key compound found in clove oil, is known for its distinct aroma and various medicinal properties. Extraction of eugenol involves isolating this compound from natural sources like cloves through different methods to obtain high purity levels. One common technique is steam distillation, where steam is passed through the clove buds to extract eugenol without degrading its chemical structure. Solvent extraction is another method that involves using organic solvents like ethanol to separate eugenol from clove oil. Both techniques require careful optimization to ensure maximum yield and purity.  After extraction, characterization of eugenol is essential to determine its chemical composition and purity. Various analytical techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) are commonly used to analyze eugenol. GC-MS allows for the separation and identification of different compounds present in a sample, while IR spectroscopy provides information about the functional groups present in eugenol molecule. These techniques help verify the presence of eugenol and assess its quality for further applications.  In the characterization process, quantifying the purity of eugenol is crucial for its use in pharmaceuticals, food, and cosmetic industries. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a powerful tool for quantifying eugenol content in a sample with high precision and accuracy. By comparing the retention time and peak area of the sample with a standard reference, the concentration of eugenol can be accurately determined. This information is vital for quality control and ensuring the efficacy of products containing eugenol.  Additionally, spectroscopic techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can provide detailed structural information about eugenol molecule. NMR helps in elucidating the connectivity of atoms within eugenol, confirming its chemical structure and purity. By analyzing the NMR spectra, chemists can verify the presence of eugenol and detect any impurities that may affect its quality.  Furthermore, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can be employed to study the thermal properties of eugenol, including its melting point and heat capacity. These thermal characteristics are essential for understanding the behavior of eugenol at different temperatures and can be crucial for its application in formulation development. By analyzing the DSC curves, researchers can determine the purity and stability of eugenol, ensuring its suitability for various industrial processes.  In conclusion, the extraction and characterization of eugenol play a vital role in ensuring the quality and efficacy of this important compound. Through techniques like steam distillation, solvent extraction, and analytical methods such as GC-MS, IR, HPLC, NMR, and DSC, scientists can isolate, identify, and quantify eugenol with high accuracy and precision. By understanding the chemical composition and properties of eugenol, researchers can harness its medicinal and aromatic benefits across a wide range of industries, from pharmaceuticals to food and cosmetics.""","600"
"3020","""The issue whether recruitment and selection techniques applied in the hospitality and tourism industry are appropriate and effective enough has triggered ongoing discussions. According to Korczynski, in a highly competitive market like this, competitive advantage can often only be achieved by providing excellent service through employees. This should reveal the importance the workforce, and thus logically also recruitment and selection, have to play in hospitality businesses. However, due to the large number of young people being employed as well as factors like low pay, missing career structures and incentives, the industry suffers from a high a similarity to employees' and employers' attitudes in the hospitality industry. These characteristics of the market might also be a reason for the abovementioned high turnover in the industry. Gold states that organisations should have a strategic plan in place which can be used as a guideline throughout the recruitment process and beyond. At the beginning of this process stands the decision if the vacated job needs to be replaced at methods should be able to 'measure' differences and 'predict' performance of the candidate. He also points out the importance of reliability; for example having two interviews with two different interviewers, and validity; being assessed against designed objectives, of selection techniques which enhance the more sophisticated techniques compared to the informal practices. Structuring an interview, for example asking the same questions to all a connection between the size of a company and the degree of implemented guidelines for recruitment and selection; larger companies displace the smaller ones to a considerable degree. With the majority of businesses in the industry being small ones, an appliance of good practise of recruitment and selection models seems very difficult. A significant number of companies ignore composing a 'job description' and 'person specification' and apply word of mouth as favourite technique for recruiting low skilled and casual staff which confirms the assumption of informal practises being widespread in the, one of the reasons for constant high turnover is the 'transient nature or part of the workforce' which leads to a continuous recruiting and selecting; a vicious circle. Businesses, especially small ones, have to be convinced that through improving their selection and recruitment methods and thus improving the culture of the work environment, this circle can be broken. It has to be demonstrated that more money is lost by working with informal methods than by investing in better techniques suggested within the literature. Small companies with low budgets could start improvement by using one of the cheaper methods like the abovementioned two interviews per candidate by two different people which would already enhance reliability. Employees are the 'human assets' of hospitality businesses. In today's highly competitive market their true value and consequently the importance of choosing the right employees should be acknowledged. If the hospitality industry, especially the small companies who tend to fall short of good recruitment and selection practises, continues to disregard suggestions made by theorists, movement towards achieving employee fit will not be possible. Even though sophisticated methods might be seen as too costly and unnecessary by some managers, the overall benefits explained above would suggest adopting some of the techniques described to improve quality of staff and thus service and competitive advantage.""","""Recruitment and selection in hospitality.""","605","""Recruitment and selection processes are pivotal in the hospitality industry, where finding the right talent can make a significant difference in the quality of service provided to guests. Hospitality businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, and resorts, rely heavily on their staff to create memorable experiences for customers. A well-thought-out recruitment and selection strategy ensures that the right candidates are hired, contributing to the overall success of the business.  Recruitment in the hospitality industry involves attracting qualified candidates to apply for available positions. This can be done through various channels, including online job boards, social media platforms, job fairs, and referrals. Employers in hospitality look for individuals with a customer-centric mindset, excellent communication skills, a strong work ethic, and the ability to work well under pressure. The recruitment process may also involve partnerships with hospitality schools or training programs to identify potential talent early on.  Once a pool of candidates is generated, the selection process begins. In hospitality, the selection criteria may include assessing candidates based on their experience, qualifications, attitude, and cultural fit. Practical assessments, such as role-playing scenarios or on-the-job observations, can also be part of the selection process to evaluate how candidates perform in real-life hospitality situations.  For front-line roles in the hospitality industry, such as front desk agents, servers, or housekeeping staff, employers often look for candidates who possess a combination of technical skills and soft skills. Technical skills may include knowledge of point-of-sale systems, housekeeping procedures, or food safety regulations, depending on the specific role. Soft skills, on the other hand, encompass traits like empathy, teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities - all crucial for delivering exceptional customer service.  Cultural fit is another key aspect of the selection process in hospitality. Employers seek candidates who align with the company's values, vision, and service standards. Cultural fit ensures that employees are more likely to be engaged, motivated, and committed to upholding the organization's reputation and brand image.  Diversity and inclusion are also important considerations in recruitment and selection in hospitality. A diverse workforce can bring fresh perspectives, enhance creativity, and cater to a wide range of guest needs. Employers in the hospitality industry strive to create inclusive environments where employees feel respected, valued, and empowered to contribute their unique talents and experiences.

"3059","""The following paper is a critical review of two research papers, in order to carry this out effectively I will be discussing the strengths and limitations of the research papers with the help of the Critical Appraisal Skills. Paper One - Effectiveness of Out-of-home Day Care For Disadvantaged Families: Randomised Controlled TrialAim of the study and Research HypothesisThe main aim of this study was to establish whether providing high quality out-of-home day care has an effect on the health of children from disadvantaged families. This was clearly focused due to: Researchers only assessing the effects of providing day care facilities for young children on the health and welfare of disadvantaged families Population studied consisted of 20 mothers and 43 a catchment area The outcomes remained the same for each family and remained relevant to the above aim The day care that was offered was clearly stated however; the researchers didn't clearly state how they measured the outcomes of the intervention. This is discussed within the critique of the research report. Critique of the Research DesignDue to the demand for day care places greatly exceeding the number of places available, following a request from the trial team, the borough's education department agreed to use random allocation as a method of rationing places. All the available places were randomly allocated to all the families on the waiting list for the day care centre. The families who previously agreed to take part in the study and were offered a place were then followed up. This enabled allocation of places to all families on the waiting list, not just those taking part in the research. Bowling, states that with a Randomised Controlled to two or more groups receiving different interventions' Bowling It was evident that this particular study was carried out as an RCT because there was random allocation of participants to an intervention a control the same process was carried order to investigate the same phenomenon. By using triangulation in this study, (interviews, questionnaires and previous studies) they were able to provide more support for their findings. Chava Frankfort-Nachmias and David Nachmias suggests this method helps minimise the degree of specificity of certain methods to particular bodies of knowledge and the hypotheses could be tested in future studies. All the findings are clearly discussed in relation to the original research question, yet only one side of the researcher's argument is discussed; the fact that greater acknowledgement needs to be given to the link between domestic violence and serious emotional distress. This could be due to this being the only side of the argument that was brought about, but by being unaware of the questions asked in both the questionnaires and interviews we cannot be 00% certain that the researchers didn't produce the questions to enable them to define the outcome they wanted to help resolve the above issue. Practice ImplicationsFrom the findings the researchers have clearly linked them to current practice or policies and previous literature. Ways that the research may be used to help women in the future has also been clearly discussed. Yet changing practice or policies due to these findings could be unethical until the researchers have made it clear of the process of obtaining these findings. ConclusionLooking back at the first paper it is reasonably clear that providing day care to disadvantaged families would create benefits for the family however, basing changes on this study and this study alone would be insignificant due to the overall results being imprecise. Another study would be needed in order to obtain results that can be trusted. In order to create a better study showing the relevant findings more effort would need to be used to ensure observer bias doesn't take place. It would also be necessary to have a more participants in order to develop a sufficient hypothesis as stated above. As for the second paper it isn't clear that the results could prove strong enough to warrant what the researchers say are the implications for practice, mainly due to the results not being clearly shown and also how these results came about due to the reasons stated earlier. Therefore, this wasn't a very trustworthy study and in order for practice to be changed accordingly it is important that the results are trustworthy. This could be easily overcome by the researches explaining more about how the research was carried out and why.""","""Critical Review of Research Papers""","823","""When conducting a critical review of research papers, it is essential to approach the task with a meticulous eye and an analytical mindset.

"251","""Five experiments were carried out to investigate the properties and uses of ultrasound waves in solids. Longitudinal waves were passed through two metal blocks to determine their longitudinal moduli, M, and Poisson's ratios,. For the aluminium block, M, and was.3. For the mild steel block, M and was.4. The echoes of longitudinal waves were also used to detect and size defects in an aluminium block, which proved successful as four defects were found. Shear waves were then produced from reflected longitudinal waves and were measured to have a velocity -, just fitting the expected value of 100ms -. Their angle of reflection and velocity were then tested against a version of Snell's Law, which proved inconclusive. Longitudinal waves were totally internally reflected to produce surface waves, the velocity of which was measured to be 860ms -, matching the theoretical value within experimental error. The wavelength of a surface wave is proportional to energy, which is related to the depth of the wave, so by passing the waves through a slot of varying depths, its wavelength was found, with a value.1. Ultrasound wavesSound with a frequency greater than 0kHz is known as ultrasound. This experiment investigated the properties and some uses of the three types of ultrasound waves that travel in solids: longitudinal waves, shear waves and Rayleigh made by the Piezoelectric effect. More about this effect, regarding transducers, can be found in reference. Liquid couplant coupled the ultrasound from the transducers into the solid samples. Although all three types of waves travel through solids, only longitudinal waves can travel through liquids. Therefore longitudinal pulses are the only ones that were generated by transducers in this experiment. Ultrasound Physics and Instrumentation, Hedrick, Hykes and Starchman, Mosby. Longitudinal and shear bulk ultrasound wavesA longitudinal pulse can be converted into shear waves can be produced by means of reflection and refraction, as figure shows.. Rayleigh ultrasound bulk wavesAs Rayleigh waves only travel on the surface of a solid, they are also known as Surface Acoustic Waves, or SAWs. They are produced by setting i in figure at the critical angle for total internal reflection for either the reflected shear or longitudinal wave, giving an angle of reflection of 0 o, leading to a surface wave. SAWs travel with a retrograde elliptical The density of material is easy to measure, so if a longitudinal wave were passed through a material, its Young's modulus can be calculated. Notice however that equation is only effective for a D object, so for this experiment, where D solids were used, the equation gives the longitudinal modulus, M, instead of E. Poisson's ratio,, is another property that can be calculated. Poisson's ratio is defined to be 'the ratio of the contraction strain normal to the applied load divided by the extension strain in the direction of the applied load'iii and is given by equation. Due to the sign is important to know that is positive for all materials that get thinner when stretched. Poisson's ratio website can be solved by using M from the previous part of the experiment and the theoretical value of E.. Mode conversionThe second part of the experiment investigated the conversion of longitudinal waves into shear testing their properties against two given equations. Firstly, an equation was given linking the distance the pulse has travelled as a longitudinal wave, dl; the distance the pulse has travelled as a shear wave, ds; the time taken, ts, for the shear wave to travel it's distance; the velocity of the longitudinal wave, vl; and the velocity of the shear wave, vs: second equation is an arrangement of Snell's Law: is the angle of reflection of the shear wave and i is the angle of incidence of the longitudinal wave. Equation can be used to calculate vs and if the value is correct and a shear wave has been located, equation should apply.. Detecting and sizing defectsThe third aim was to use 'sonar' properties of longitudinal ultrasound to detect, locate and size defects within an aluminium block. Detection can be achieved quite simply by knowing the velocity of a wave and the time it takes for the wave to reach the defect.. Calculating the velocity of a Rayleigh a SAW has been velocity, cr, can be calculated by making time and distance measurements. Theoretical value of cr is given by:. Crack DetectionFinally, by measuring the energy of the wave at different depths in a block, an estimate of the wavelength of the SAW can be a transducer. For many of the experiments an additional 'receiver' transducer was connected to another channel of the oscilloscope, which picked up the pulse once it had travelled through the sample. The transducers and the samples were assembled as shown in figure The delay-time facility on the oscilloscope enables the time between wave transmission and reflection to be determined. The pulse was set at slowest rate so that the subsequent transmitted pulse wasn't shown on the oscilloscope before the first reflection. All time errors in this investigation are due to the pulse having multiple measured to enable the velocity of the pulse, vl, to be calculated. The metal samples were also weighed, using digital scales, and measured so that their density could be calculated and thus the longitudinal moduli and then the Poisson's ratios could be obtained.. Results and discussionThe graphs shows vl, to -through aluminium - through mild steel. The actual value of be 400ms - so the gradient of figure be steeper. Since the time measurements all seemed quite accurate, increasing by sensibly even amounts, then the problem must lie in the distance measurement. A possible reason for this is that the thickness of the liquid couplant wasn't taken into account, so the distances should all be slightly greater, which would give a steeper graph. Fundamentals of Ultrasonics, Blitz The actual value of be 5/800-000ms -v, therefore the value obtained experimentally was within the expected range. The density of the aluminium was calculated to - and the density of the mild steel to - Substituting these values into:, M aluminium=10.GPa vi and M steel=78.GPa vi. Both values are larger than the experimental ones, which should be expected from the fact that vl for aluminium is too low and vl for mild steel could be too low. Also, it shows that the above errors have been underestimated. The theoretical value for Young's modulus is 0.GPa vi for aluminium and 11.GPa vi for mild steel. Putting this and the experimental value for M into equation gives Due to the small errors in M, these both have negligible errors, despite them not quite matching their theoretical values of.45/8 vi for aluminium and.91 vi for mild steel. Mode Conversion3. Experimental DetailsThe longitudinal wave hits the metal-air interface at i = 5/8 o then a shear wave is reflected at angle. In this case, a distance was measured by means other than vernier callipers as distance dl was measured using trigonometry. Sin was also measured using trigonometry by using distance ds and the height. Both the reflected longitudinal and the reflected shear waves were detected, but were far enough apart to be distinguishable. All the waves are actually divergent beams, so it was important to ensure that the peak of the shear wave had been located.. Results and discussionReferring back to equation, on insertion of the measured values of dl and ds, the observed value of ts and the known value of vl iv the velocity of the reflected shear wave turned out to be Error was calculated using standard error formulae. The actual value for vs for aluminium is 100ms - so the experimental value was just accurate within error. Testing equation, sin was found to equal.1. Looking at the right hand side of the equation, substituting in 5/800ms - for v s and known values of sin45/8 and vl gives.9. The fact that the two sides are not equal might well be due to vs being too big. This experiment could be improved by using the oscilloscope to test if some of the longitudinal wave was picked up as well, and repeating readings at different points to find if the equation does hold at any point.. Locating and sizing defects3. Experimental Details In this experiment the dB drop-technique method was used: Ultrasonic Methods of NDT, Blitz and Simpson The MHz transducer is moved around the block until a defect is. Surface wave generation3. Experimental DetailTo find the critical angle of a Rayleigh wave in mild steel the following arrangements of Snell's Law were used: Values used: From Tables of Physical and Chemical Constants, Kaye and Laby To produce surface waves l and s must = 0 o i is set to 3 o, which is fairly close to i for the shear wave so this will be the one to turn into a Rayleigh wave.. ResultsThe graph shows that the experimental value of v - The theoretical value for a Rayleigh out as 900ms -. Therefore the experimental result is correct within experimental error. It might be useful to see if using a combination of materials where the critical angles of the samples match exactly would give an even better result.. Crack Detection3. Experimental DetailsThe depth at each point could be measured by knowing the gradient of the slot and the distance the transducers were along the block.Four amplitude measurements were made for each depth. The average value of the amplitude was then taken, with its corresponding error being the standard deviation of all the amplitude values at that point.. Results When energy = E/ equation becomes and rearranging this gives, mm. Summary and conclusion4. Bulk Wave GenerationMethods for finding the velocity of longitudinal waves were tested and found to be fundamentally correct; however the value for aluminium was slightly lower than the theoretical value. This could be due to too small distance measurements, which could have been because the distance of the liquid couplant wasn't taken into account. The longitudinal moduli and Poisson's ratios were all slightly lower than the expected values, which reflects the possible low values of both the velocities.. Mode ConversionLongitudinal and shear reflected waves were detected, with the shear wave having the smaller angle of reflection, as expected. The velocity of the reflected shear wave vs in aluminium was found to - so was fairly accurate considering it should have been 110ms Snell's law was tested for the shear waves. From the experimental results the equation did not seem to hold. This could have been due to not finding the correct position of the shear wave, which could be why slightly too large. Therefore, testing to see whether the equation was true proved inconclusive.. Detecting and sizing defectsThe size, shape and depth of defects were found using ultrasound waves and their reflections through an aluminium block. As all four defects were found, the dB drop technique method proved to be useful, however the sizing of the defects was probably incorrect due to the fact that relative to the transducer the defects were small.. Surface Wave GenerationSurface waves were generated using total internal reflection of shear waves. The angle of incidence was set by the wedge transducers used and was close to the angle calculated using Snell's law for Perspex/ mild steel. The velocity of the Rayleigh waves was calculated to be. Equations were used to find the theoretical the results matched within error. Distance between transducers had error due to it being tricky to ensure that they were exactly in position, as they slid easily on the liquid couplant. There is a systematic error, as time for waves to travel through Perspex hadn't been subtracted from final times, however, this will not affect the gradient, which is all that is of interest.. Crack DetectionThe amplitude of Rayleigh waves were measured as the passed through an aluminium slot of varying depths. The square of the amplitude is proportional to the wave energy. It is known that at /e times max energy the depth of slot there will equal the wavelength of the Rayleigh wave. From the graph, was found to The graph was a fairly good straight line ln graph, showing that the energy did decrease exponentially with slot depth. Difficulties here were firstly with the block: anomalous results in a first attempt suggest that the slot was not smooth and the couplant might be filling it. Overall points to note The PC oscilloscope was used throughout the experiment to make time and distance measurements. Often peaks jumped with amplitudes varying significantly from one frame to the next, so affecting distance measurements. Also it was hard to measure the time due to multiple the PC oscilloscope seemed as if it would be a better instrument than the traditional oscilloscope as it has cursors, which avoids human measurement error. Also, values for time, volts/div etc. can be shown on the monitor so reading them off by eye is no longer a problem. Its one disadvantage is hat the PC and cables introduce noise into the system, which the other one wouldn't.""","""Ultrasound Waves in Solids Experiment""","2628","""Ultrasound Waves in Solids Experiment  Ultrasound waves have found versatile applications in the field of science and technology, ranging from medical diagnostics to industrial inspections. One fascinating aspect of ultrasound waves is their ability to propagate through solids, providing valuable insights into the material's properties and internal structures. Conducting experiments to study ultrasound waves in solids offers a unique opportunity to understand wave behavior, explore the characteristics of different materials, and enhance our knowledge of wave mechanics. In this discussion, we will delve into the principles behind ultrasound waves in solids experiments, explore the methodology involved, and highlight the significance of such experiments in various sectors.  Exploring the Principles of Ultrasound Waves in Solids  Ultrasound waves are mechanical waves with frequencies higher than the human audible range, typically above 20 kHz.

The aim is to progress through the earlier levels, completing tasks, improving your development team and making important choices about the development process, until eventually, you reach the release - the maintenance level. He who has amassed the greatest number of points then wins the game. The points came from a range of things which are calculated when you finish - the amount of cash you have, the quality of your development team and the speed with which you completed the game. Competition comes in from other development houses, seeking to gather the best programmers for their own projects, rushing to get out competing software and fighting tooth and nail for stakeholder's money. FeaturesIn total there will be eleven different types of tile upon the board, three types of card - programmer, chance and backup, up to six player pieces, six sets of coloured pins, one die and many wads of cash. Following this is a brief description of each of these that need explaining, their purpose in the game, alongside any necessary details and available images. The Board:As stated above, the board will be split into five different levels; each tiered above the earlier one. The board will be constructed of the hard board as stated as available by Rachael. People will navigate the board in a clockwise manner, moving up and down between levels using the up and down tiles. Each level shall be split into a number of tiles. Here is shown the manner in which they shall be laid out: Tiles:Start Square:At the beginning of the game, all players should lay their pieces inside the start square. The highest roller will then initiate a clockwise rotation around the board based on their second roll. Following this it has no further significance and can be considered a 'safe' square. Move Up Square:When you land on this square you have the choice of moving up a level. Each one of these tiles will have six holes drilled into the top of it. The first time you move up each level having completed all compulsory tasks for that level, you must collect an amount of the bank and place one of your coloured pegs inside one of the holes. Move Down Square:When you move on this square you can move down to the same square on the level below. Bug Square:When you land on a bug square, you must wait in that square for three turns, or roll a double to escape. Crash Square:When you land on a crash square you must go down to the Move Down tile on the level below, or forsake a backup card. Chance Square:When you land on a chance square you can either choose not to do anything, or pick up a chance card. See Chance Cards. Trade Square:Unless you wish to obtain a new programmer or backup card, you can just ignore this tile. If you wish to get a new backup card then you must swap one of your programmer cards for one with the management. If you wish to get a programmer card then you must specify whether you wish to buy it from the management or from a particular player. You then have the choice of buying a random card from either, or buying a particular card. If the purchase is from the management, then the employment cost of each programmer is specified for direct purchases. The cost for purchasing a random programmer from the management though is thus quite a gamble. The same kind of rules exist for trade with other players, just the player you are going to purchase of specifies the amount for both individual purchases and random ones. For random purchases, all available programmer cards should be well shuffled before being sold. Compulsory Task Square:Task squares will vary, all of them will have six holes drilled into them though. They will specify on their tiles what you will have to do to complete the tasks - some will require that you have already completed a prior task. Some will simply require rolls of the dice, some will require payments to complete, some will have requirements on the number, skill and type of programmers that you have. The completion of all compulsory task squares is obligatory though - not necessarily the first time you land on them, but to finish the game. You should use your pegs to mark of the completion of a task square. Here are some examples of tasks: Optional Task Square:These are essentially the same as compulsory task squares but without being compulsory. Higher level optional tasks may require that you have completed other optional tasks, but it won't be required to complete the game.The benefit of completing them is that they will confer some advantage - but not without some counterbalancing disadvantage or risk. Some of these may only be completable by one player, but most will be completable by anyone that wishes to and thus can have up to six holes drilled into it. Here are some examples of optional tasks: Choice Square:When you land on a choice you there and then have to make a decision that will affect the rest of the game. There will be six holes drilled down each side of this tile. You will be presented with two options, and you must place your peg into the choice side you wish to go with. This choice will not be changeable, and will have consequences such as the availability of certain optional tasks. Here are some examples of choices: Tax square:When you land on one of these squares you must pay the amount specified by on the tile. This amount will vary between tiles. Finish Square:The finish square is located in the centre of the board. It is a form of task square, which requires that all prior compulsory tasks have been completed. A suitably cunning task has not yet been devised. Cards:Programmer Cards:You obtain programmer cards at the start of the game. All of your cards must be displayed clearly in front of you throughout the game. See the Trade Square for information on how cards are swapped and purchased throughout the game. Each programmer will have his speciality type of a programmer ranking score. It will generally be better for you to have high scoring programmers whose specialities match that of your company. INSERT PICTURE OF PROGRAMMER CARD Backup Cards:These will be brought while on trade squares by trading a programmer. They are used to avoid the effects of crash squares - something very important in the tenser parts of the game. Chance Cards:Chance cards will have a range of effects, both positive and negative. Many will have both good and bad sides, depending on the choices you made in the game so far, and the tasks you have thus far completed. Here are some examples of chance cards: If you have completed all optional tasks so far, Manager is pleased with current progress and grants extra funds to project If developing an Operating System: New version of competing system released - management steps up funding. Take a new programmer card. Programmers receive extra training - get 0 points for each programmer you have Backup server crashes - Unless you choose to have programmer pairs, loose all backup cards If you have a programmer with ranking over 0: 'Talent' scout offers your programmers higher salary, either loose your programmer or pay to keep them on INSERT EXAMPLE PICTURE OF CHANCE CARDS Player Pieces:These will be small circular pieces, capable of being placed into small plastic holders. They will have the name of a company on one side, and the logo of the company on the other. The player piece will be pulled out of a bag at the start of the game, this will have the effect of forcing the player to have a certain speciality, potentially pitting them against another player for programmer cards. Rules of the GameOne player should be elected as 'manager', who will henceforth be in charge of dealing out cash and programmer cards. When you start the game you must select a company piece from the bag and slid the company's marker into your holder - this is now your playing piece. Each company comes with its own speciality which will have relevance throughout the game (read more under specialities). The manager should then deal each player a selection of five random programmer cards, X amount of cash and 0 coloured pegs. All playing pieces should then be placed on the start square, located on the first level. The dice should then be rolled by each player, and then who ever has the highest role starts the game. Each player takes their turn to roll the dice, progressing around the board in a clockwise direction. Their next action depends on which square they land on - unless the consequences of that square is that they should not move during the next turn, then they should pass the die on and wait till their next turn. To win the game you must complete the final task. Your score should then be calculated based on; amount of cash, number of programmers, programmer specialities and speed of development (in relation to other players). Two alternate ways of winning/playing the game are the 'last man standing' and 'poker' rules. The last man standing rules work by making it so you cannot go down a level and eliminating the last player to reach each level. This way only one player is actually able to reach the top and automatically wins. The poker rules are a modification on the last man standing rules, whereby, someone that got kicked out earlier in the game could still beat the person who got to the top - if they had more points than them. This would only work on the basis that the risk occurred by going up each level increased greatly. JustificationI feel that we are well justified in developing this game on the grounds that we have covered many different facets of software engineering. In the most obvious sense we have gone for a waterfall model based design, but within that there is much more. It will be possible to have the iteration between levels of the waterfall, which was added to the model later on, due to the ability to choose to move up and down between levels. On each level there will be things to do with software engineering practises relevant to that stage, coming through in the form of tasks and choice squares. For instance, an example of a choice square for the design level would be whether to use a structured design methodology, which may require you to complete all the optional tasks, or use a RAD methodology which might require greater programmer skill but less tasks needing doing. Because there will be things such as chance cards which might pop up and make life a lot easier if you had made a certain choice or performed a certain task, players will get a better concept of whether they like taking that kind of risk in real projects. We will be trying to set the game up so this facet of play really does come through. On top of all that we have also tried to take a side-swipe at the business and management side of software engineering in the form of having the programming teams, trading of workers, resource management etc. By having competing teams, some maybe racing to get there first, others maybe taking it slow and steady, building up cash supplies and taking on every optional task, we hope to highlight that there is not right or wrong way to go about software engineering but only possible ways. Design HistoryThe game started off as a monopoly based game, where tasks would be bought and everything done in very much a monopoly style way. We discovered that many people were going about a similar style project and decided to be more ambitious and original Considered changing it into a form of drinking game where you drink when you land on someone else's 'property' Were told not to make a drinking game We decided tasks should require actually doing something, instead of just being brought. The original idea that arose was using questions. We decided against questions, as there weren't that many you could really ask. The idea of having pseudo-random tasks being performed came up, along with the idea of having choices. We decided that we wouldn't have money in the game as it would unnecessarily complicate things and there wasn't much point for it. Programmer cards were brought up as a way to add some element of having to prepare for harder tasks. The idea of a D board came up Backup cards were originally suggested but with little purpose but got accepted in Reaching the centre first was decided as the method of winning the game Having programmer specialities was decided on as a way to enhance competitiveness between players Decision to create lots of new tiles as the game was quite dull only having tasks and choices Trade squares were added as a way to formalize buying/selling cards Backup cards were phased out as pointless Cash came back, as we needed to buy/sell programmer cards, pay for tasks and choices etc - it now had a purpose Chance cards were brought in as a way to add random fun Two alternative methods of winning, being the last man standing and poker rules were suggested It was decided that last man standing and poker rules would be best of kept as alternate rules and that winning should instead be based on calculating points A combo of Crash Bug squares was thought up as a way to add penalties to the game Crash and Bug squares were separated to make each square less complicated Backup cards were brought back in as a solution to crash cards Tax squares were thought up as a way to dispose of cash Up/Down squares were formalized as the way to move between levels Minor rules filled out when rule book was written The number of tiles on each level and the layout of the board was decided Decision to make D models to test out board textures made The idea of a D triangular board was brought up, and voted against due to the large amount of work already gone into square board, and the waste of material that would result from use of the triangle""","""Game design based on software engineering""","2791","""Game design, at its core, combines creativity and technical expertise to create interactive experiences that engage and entertain players. Software engineering plays a pivotal role in shaping the structure, functionality, and performance of a game. From designing game mechanics to developing graphics and coding AI behaviors, every aspect of game design relies on software engineering principles to bring the virtual worlds to life. Let's delve deeper into how game design is intricately intertwined with software engineering principles.  One of the fundamental aspects of game design is creating engaging gameplay mechanics. Game designers conceptualize how players will interact with the game world, including movement, combat, puzzles, and more. These mechanics serve as the building blocks of the gameplay experience, defining the rules and systems that govern player actions. Software engineers work closely with game designers to implement these mechanics using programming languages like C++, Java, or Python. By writing clean and efficient code, engineers ensure that the gameplay mechanics function smoothly and respond to player input in real-time.  Moreover, game design involves the creation of captivating visuals and immersive environments. Artists and graphic designers collaborate to craft stunning visuals, encompassing landscapes, characters, animations, and special effects. Software engineering comes into play to optimize these visuals for different platforms and hardware configurations. Engineers use rendering techniques, shaders, and graphics libraries to ensure that the visuals are displayed correctly and run smoothly on a wide range of devices, from high-end gaming PCs to mobile phones.  In addition to graphics, sound and music are essential components of game design that enhance the overall player experience. Sound designers create audio assets such as background music, sound effects, and voiceovers to complement the gameplay. Software engineers integrate these audio elements into the game engine, synchronizing them with in-game events and actions. By implementing audio processing techniques and frameworks, engineers ensure that the sound enhances immersion and engagement, adding another layer of depth to the gaming experience.  Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) is crucial in developing realistic and dynamic non-player characters (NPCs) and enemy behaviors in games. Game designers define the behavior patterns and decision-making processes of NPCs to provide challenging and responsive gameplay. Software engineers implement AI algorithms and logic to bring these characters to life, making them adapt to changing situations, learn from player interactions, and provide a realistic and engaging experience. Through machine learning and data-driven approaches, engineers can create sophisticated AI systems that enhance the game's replay value and immersion.  Multiplayer functionality is another aspect of game design that relies heavily on software engineering expertise. Designing multiplayer games involves implementing networking protocols, server architecture, and synchronization mechanisms to enable real-time interactions between players in different locations. Software engineers design scalable and robust networking systems that can handle thousands of simultaneous connections, ensuring a seamless and lag-free multiplayer experience. By optimizing server-client communication, managing game state synchronization, and addressing latency issues, engineers create multiplayer games that are both competitive and cooperative.  Moreover, game optimization is a critical aspect of both game design and software engineering. Optimizing a game involves improving performance, reducing load times, and ensuring stability across different platforms. Software engineers employ profiling tools, debugging techniques, and performance optimizations to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the game code. By analyzing and refactoring code, engineers enhance the game's frame rate, memory usage, and overall responsiveness, providing players with a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.  Quality assurance and testing are integral parts of the game development process that rely on both game design principles and software engineering practices. QA testers evaluate the game's functionality, stability, and user experience to identify bugs, glitches, and other issues that could detract from the gameplay. Software engineers work closely with QA teams to troubleshoot and fix bugs, ensuring that the game meets quality standards and delivers a polished and error-free experience to players. By conducting thorough testing procedures, developers can address issues early in the development cycle and prevent potential pitfalls in the final release.  In conclusion, game design based on software engineering is a collaborative and iterative process that blends creativity and technical proficiency to create immersive and engaging game experiences. From designing gameplay mechanics to implementing graphics, AI, multiplayer functionality, and optimization techniques, game designers and software engineers work hand in hand to bring virtual worlds to life. By leveraging advanced technologies, programming languages, and development tools, game developers can push the boundaries of interactive entertainment, delivering innovative and captivating games that resonate with players worldwide. The fusion of game design and software engineering continues to drive the evolution of the gaming industry, shaping the future of digital entertainment and immersive storytelling.""","897"
"3091","""Pumps are used to impart energy in to a fluid, there are two main varieties of pump, axial flow, centrifugal. The Tesla pump is a form of centrifugal pump and was developed by a famous scientist & Inventor called Nikola Tesla. Tesla patented a new principle which utilised the properties of adhesion and viscous shear as a means to pump a fluid. With this principle he was able to design a new type of pump that used the same principles of a centrifugal pump without employing the typical impeller. This design of pump is still relatively unknown and is used little in industry. It is the purpose of this Project to investigate the properties of the Tesla pump to develop an in depth understanding of the pumps operating characteristics. AimThe aim of this project is to design, build and test a Tesla pump. The goal is to prototype the design, and gain quantitive data of the pumps performance through practical testing and theoretical analysis. The pumps performance will be compared to published practical and theoretical data. ObjectivesThe main objectives of the project are:Design of a Tesla PumpConstruct a prototype of the pump designEvaluate characteristics of the pumps design, investigate the following parameters:Rotor disk spacingFluids of varying viscositiesDisk angular velocityCritically compare test data with published dataBackgroundNikola Tesla was a famous scientists and inventor who was regarded as one of the leading innovative engineers of the 9 th and 0 th Centuries. He is best known for discovering alternating current electric power, polyphase power distribution and the A.C motor. He was Born 0 th July 85/86 in Croatia and studied electrical engineering at an Austrian Polytechnic. In 881 he worked for the American Telephone Company in Budapest where he was the chief electrician to the company. In 882 he moved to France to work as an electrical engineer, it is during this time that Tesla first conceived the idea of creating electrical currents using rotating magnetic fields, later patented in 888. In 884 Tesla moved to the US, where he started working for the Edison Machine Works, he progressed from simple electrical engineering work to completely redesigning the companies continuous current dynamos. Much of Tesla's work during the late 9 th century was spent pioneering modern electrical engineering. In 888 Tesla demonstrated his brushless alternate-current induction motor to the Institute of Electrical Equation. - Kinematic Viscosity Pump Operating PrinciplesWhether the design is termed a pump or a blower simply depends on the fluid that is being used. The common term for air pumps being blower. Which ever fluid is being transported, the principles of operation are exactly the same. The disks are spun via and external energy source at a constant angular velocity. The layer of fluid in contact with the surface of the disks is carried by it due to friction, and thrown outwards by centrifugal forces. The fluid leaves the periphery of the disks and exits through the volute house, depicted red in Figure. The energy imparted into the layer nearest the disk is transferred into the layers of fluid in the spacing between the disks via viscous shear. This energy transfer method is the key principle of the design, the viscous properties of the fluid play a vital part in the pumps performance. In his states that to achieve maximum efficiency the energy transfer should be as gradual as possible. The volume of fluid leaving the pump is replaced by fluid entering through the central opening of the disks, depicted blue in Figure. Conventional pumps use impulse or reaction to achieve momentum transfer; the blades of the impeller operate on the same principles as a wing. As the fluid flows over the blade, a force is acts on the fluid owing to the lifting force due to the pressure difference. The pressure difference is cause by the fluid deflecting off the the change in velocity and direction produces the pressure Following the law of conservation, assuming no energy loss between two sections, then the energy at one equal the energy at another main questions when developing initial concepts were, what size disk to use, what thickness of disk and what should the spacing between the disks Table. shows some examples of existing designs, mostly turbines, collected from various sources. The data was gathered to see if there was any correlation between disk size, thickness and spacing. Much of the early small model development done by Tesla used disk spacing of /2' (.9mm) and 0 disks. The actual disk diameters and number of disks varied between less than inches diameter up to 0 inches diameter for large scale turbines. More recent analysis done by Brieter & Pohlhausen suggest that the disk gap is a critical parameter in the design. They use Equation. to define the gap size, D. This gap size ensures that only laminar flow is present in the space between the disks. BREITER, M.C & POHLHAUSEN, K 'Laminar flow between two parallel rotating disks' Aeronautical Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, March 962 Equation. - Critical Gap size to maintain boundary layer Since the Kinematic viscosity decreases with temperature, Equation. shows that a higher temperature fluid requires a larger disk spacing, but as the angular velocity increases the gap width reduces. In the case of the pump, pumping fluid at constant temperature, the disk spacing will vary with angular velocity. Table. shows the typical disk spacing for water at 0C with the pump operating at different angular velocities. An example calculation can be seen below: Discflo are a commercial company who specialise in pumps for extreme applications, such as pump non-Newtonian designs typically have very large disk spacing allowing solids to be pumped, which suggests that small disk spacing is not a necessity for effective pump design. The aim is to test these theories by varying the disk spacing and angular velocity on the prototype. For practical reasons the disk spacing on the prototype will be.mm minimum. During research into Tesla pump there were several designs of interest. One such design was that used by Tesla during his demonstrations early on in the pumps development stages. This pump design used several disks approximately inches in diameter. Although no quantative data was published for this demonstration model text suggests it generated modest flow rates for its size. Another design was for use in the automotive industry as a coolant pump for an engine. The design specification was for a four inch diameter water pump. 'Specifically designed to pump cooling water for internal combustion engines of all sizes and types. It has an inch and a quarter inlet and a one inch outlet. It will pump approximately,00 gallons of water per hour at 2 PSI. It is driven by a flat pancake type D. C. motor that is only /' thick. It's power requirement is 00 watts.' Automobile System Coolant Pump the Phoenix Turbine Builders Club there is a Turbine rotor kit commercially available, it is a. inch diameter rotor assembly, which consists of several disks made from stainless steel 04, the rotor assembly is quoted as weighing approximately achieving fractional HP output. Phoenix Turbine Builders Club Tesla turbine has been manufactured by John A. Davis which uses computer hard drive platters as the disks for the turbine. These disks are approximately.5/8 inches in diameter, with a disk spacing of. is standard disk spacing in hard drives. Building a Tesla Turbine from hard drive platters, Author JOHN A. DAVIS. shows an image of his final design. Acrylic has been employed as the casing to allow visual insight into the turbines operation. The turbine is run off of a 0psi compressed air supply. Also of interest was a paper written by G. Wiseman which details the design process of a Tesla pump offering the authors findings on various parameters of the pumps design. WISEMAN, G. 'Tesla Pump Comments - Implementation of Innovation', Eagle-Research archive, 996 For the purpose of this project the pump design was chosen to be based around the automobile coolant pump described earlier, this allowed some initial design requirements to be specified to which the pump could be designed. The pump requirements will be: Flow rate of 000 Gal/Hr Operating pressure to be 2 PSIUsing data and formulae from Wiseman, the power required to meet these pump requirements can be determined. For pumping water the general pump formula is: Equation. - General Pump Formula Head is a measure of the unit mass of fluid, and can be defined as the height to which a column of fluid must rise to contain the same energy as the fluid in a given set of conditions. This can be thought of as the energy a pump puts into a fluid in order to raise the fluid to a desired height. GLENN A. BARIS 'A Quantitive Analysis of the Tesla Turbo Machine', 001 Flow can be seen that for a non-compressible fluid the density remains constant and the velocity of a fluid decreases with increasing area. Equation.0. - Continuity Equation Wiseman recommends making the area of the volute at least equal to the volume within the disk pack. The volute profile was created using a standard script file, called a LISP file in AutoCAD2002, this enabled the area of the volute profile to be calculated. The taper between the volute profile to circular outlet was kept a smooth transition in order to minimise turbulence and hence losses. Final Pump DesignThe final pump design can be seen in Appendix, which contains the relevant manufacturing drawings of all the pumps components. The software used to generate the D model and associated D manufacturing drawings was SolidWorks 005/8. As discussed earlier of the two concept options developed the volute scroll the preferred option. Discussion with the mechanical workshop on suitable ways to manufacture the pump were discussed, and changes were made to the concept to simplify the manufacturing process. The overall concept of the design was kept the same, the biggest change was to make the casing out of two halves rather than the piece design. The two parts would be located by dowels to ensure accurate alignment necessary to obtain the tight clearances to the seals between the casing walls and the disks. These seals are there to prevent back flow between the disks periphery and the inlet. The two casings would be held together using M4 bolts situated around the outside of the volute profile. Sealing of the two casings was also discussed, and various ways of achieving a good hydraulic seal were investigated. 'O'-Ring Seal - This would have to follow the volute profile, which would necessitate machining an O-ring groove around the profile. This was deemed to introduce unnecessary complexity into the manufacturing process considering that the design would only get to the prototype stage. Gasket Seal - This would simply consists of a thin layer of material, (rubber, paper, or similar suitable material) that would be sandwiched between the two casing faces. The main draw back of this option was it meant in could introduce larger than desirable clearances between the disks and the casing seals. The gasket would have to be compressed down to over a large surface area which would necessitate high clamping loads on the bolts securing the two casing together. The option chosen for sealing the two casings for prototype purposes was to simply produce a good surface finish between the two mating faces. The use of gasket sealant would also be an option should the mating faces not prove effective. However for a design intended for industrial applications, sufficient sealing would be required, where the extra cost of machining for example an O-ring groove would be minimal at high production volumes. The machining out of the volute scroll was another point for discussion. In the original concept design the volute scroll went all the way through the material and the sides were bolted onto this. This was to enable simple manufacturing due to the scroll only needing D CNC operation. This allowed the possibility of producing a CNC program that consisted to multiple curves on multiple centres, allowing the program to be hand written, a simple if somewhat laborious process. However the change to a two piece casing introduces some manufacturing complexities. The profile for the volute scroll could be produced from the D model using CAD/CAM software, which allowed the use of complex lofts between the volute pocket and the pump outlet. The main material could be rough machined away, and final cuts done using a bull-nose cutter to produce the final radiused volute profile as shown in Figure.1. Difficulties in machining of this profile can be due to the swarf being pulled into the path of the cutter which throws out achievable tolerance accuracy, this is particularly a problem when climb and 1' (5/8.mm) outlet diameter. These values were later reduced during the final design stages in order to use standard size tubing. Standard reinforced PVC tubing was specified with 25/8mm & 32mm for outlet and inlet respectively found from the RS website. RS stores Shaft SpeedThe critical shaft speed can be determined from the following equation for the loading condition shown in Figure.1. The load acting on the shaft is the mass of the disks and spacers. The length 'l' is the distance from the centre of the nearest bearing to the centre of the disks. Mass of single disk:Disk outer Total the actual the inlet holes from 2.mm to 3mm, which gave the head of the retaining bolts a little more clearance from the neck of the inlet. Prototype ManufactureThe actual manufacture of the pump components started early on in the design the workshop working from preliminary drawings showing basic component dimensions. Detailed drawings were passed to the workshop on completion. This was not an ideal design process but working to the tight time schedule meant compromises were necessary. All final design manufacturing drawings were in the workshop by week of semester Test SetupWork still needs to be carried out on the design of the test equipment, mountings for the drive motor in order to measure the torque required to drive the pump need to be designed and fabricated. Toothed pulley's and belt need to be source which will be used to drive the pump, and final decisions on testing procedures needs to be worked out. The testing is planned to take place during week or semester, and as discussed is reliant on the pump being manufactured in time. The components required for the test rig are: Electric motor to drive the pump A motor has been sourced which is complete with electronic speed control. The motor its self is an A.C induction motor rated at.5/8Kw @ 800 Rev/min. This will be coupled to the pump drive shaft via a toothed belt drive. A toothed belt was chosen in order to prevent slip in the drive system and eliminated the need for correct belt tension to ensure maximum torque is transmitted as is the case for Vee belts. The Final operating speed of the pump is yet to be determined, although it was envisaged to run the pump up to speeds of 000 Rev/min, this would require running the pump on a: ratio, so that pump would be running at 25/80 Rev/min. Pressure gauges Pressure tapings will be required on the inlet and outlet of the pump in order to calculate the head produced by the pump in all configurations. Flow non-scientific approach to measuring the flow rate of the pump will be utilised. This simply consists of timing how long the pump takes to transfer a known quantity of fluid. Containers to hold the fluid being pumped tachometer to measure pump speed Instrument to measure torque ScheduleTo date the project is running approximately on schedule. The pump design has been completed and has been transferred to the workshop for manufacture. Some of the components have been completed and nearly all of the components are in some stage of production. As outlined in the project plan submitted at the beginning of the project, the important mile stones for the first semester were: Semester MilestonesProject Plan Submission Wk3 0 th October 005/8Pump Design Completed Wk6 rd November 005/8Interim Report Submission Wk10 8 th November 005/8Pump Manufacture Complete Wk12 2 th December 005/8All of these milestones should be met within the time requirements. Unfortunately the manufacturing of the pump is reliant on the workshop being able to allocated the necessary time to complete the project. There are however many different resources using the mechanical workshop and as such the date for the pumps completions is a little uncertain. The workshop has been made aware of the overall aim of having a completed pump design and test equipment ready for testing during week of semester, during meetings this was deemed to be a reasonable deadline considering efforts were made to get working drawings into the workshop as early as week of semester. Semester MilestonesPump Evaluation Tests start Wk1 0 th Jan 006Final Report Submission Wk10 rd November 006Project presentation Wk12 7 th April 006The main milestones for semester are generally regarding the completion of the project, however there are many small milestones that must be completed in order to achieve the objectives set out in the initial project plan. As discussed the ability to start testing of the pump during the first few weeks of semester is a key milestone that should be met to ensure that the project remains on schedule. This should allow time to compile the results and compile a conclusive pump analysis. An additional milestones that can be added to the time plan. Pump Evaluation Test Completion Wk4 0 th February 006A revised version of the original project schedule can be seen in Appendix. Completed TasksBelow is a summarised list of completed tasks:Project plan written and submittedIn-depth literature study of published papersCollection of data for comparative analysis with practical test resultsDetailed prototype Tesla pump designComplete set of manufacturing drawingsManufactured prototype pump for evaluation purposesInterim report detailing project progressEnvisaged Project scheduleThe initial project plan required a detailed plan of what tasks needed to be completed and when in order to achieve the projects objectives. Although accurate in the initial brief, there are some details that under estimated the time and resource requirements. Completing and analytical evaluation of the pump design has proven to be a much more complex process than first envisaged. Technical papers detailing the analytical process of evaluating the pump performance indicate that a feasible solution involves mathematical solutions of great complexity. Calculating the velocity profile of the fluid across the disks has been found to be an involved mathematical process. This requires exact solutions of the Navier-Strokes equations for the boundary layer on the surface of the disks in order to describe the velocity profiles across the disk. Some of the technical papers obtained have side stepped this particular problem by assuming a parabolic velocity profile, and 'friction factor' used as a parameter descriptive of the frictional properties of the flow passage. RICE, W. 'An Analytical and Experimental Investigation of Multiple-Disk Turbines' Journal of Engineering for Power, to be an achievable goal. Sincere thanks must go to the technicians in the Mechanical workshop, Namely Chris Boram for help during the initial design stages and sourcing of components, and Warwick Major for help on the design and manufacturing or the pump components to very high standards. On going work has been discussed, and a revised time plan has been issued. Testing of the design is scheduled for early 006, theoretical analysis of the design will be done in parallel with testing. Results for testing are planned to be completed by week, and all data analysed by week semester. The overall progress of the project appears to be following the envisaged plan, with the pump prototype very close to completion. Analytical work has been more complex than envisaged, and will required more attention. Gaining performance data of the prototype is the key requirement of the project and will hopefully be completed as planned.""","""Tesla Pump Development and Analysis""","3962","""Tesla pump development has gained significant attention in the realm of fluid dynamics, offering a revolutionary approach to fluid transportation and circulation. This innovative technology, inspired by Nikola Tesla's work, utilizes principles of electromagnetic fields to propel and control the movement of fluids efficiently. In this comprehensive analysis, we will delve into the evolution of Tesla pump technology, its underlying concepts, potential applications across various industries, advantages, challenges, and future prospects.  The Tesla pump operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where the interaction between a magnetic field and a conductive fluid induces motion. By applying alternating current to coils surrounding a conduit filled with fluid, a rotating magnetic field is generated. This field imparts kinetic energy to the fluid, causing it to move through the conduit without the need for any physical parts or components. This fundamental concept enables the pump to operate without mechanical seals or moving parts, reducing maintenance requirements and eliminating the risk of mechanical failure.  One of the key advantages of Tesla pumps is their ability to handle a wide range of fluid viscosities, temperatures, and chemical compositions. Traditional pumps may struggle with highly viscous or corrosive fluids, leading to inefficiencies or premature wear. Tesla pumps, on the other hand, can handle such challenging fluids with ease due to their non-contact operation and lack of moving parts. This versatility makes them suitable for diverse applications in industries such as chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, and wastewater treatment.  Furthermore, Tesla pumps are known for their energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. Unlike conventional pumps that rely on mechanical components to create flow, Tesla pumps leverage electromagnetic principles to drive fluid movement, resulting in lower energy consumption and operating costs. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in industries where fluid handling processes account for a significant portion of overall energy usage.  In addition to their efficiency, Tesla pumps offer improved controllability and precision in fluid handling. By modulating the frequency and intensity of the electromagnetic field, operators can adjust the flow rate and pressure of the pumped fluid with high precision. This level of control is crucial in applications where precise dosing or metering is required, such as in chemical manufacturing or laboratory environments.  Despite these advantages, Tesla pump technology faces certain challenges that need to be addressed for wider adoption. One primary concern is the scalability of these pumps for industrial applications. While Tesla pumps have demonstrated exceptional performance in laboratory settings and small-scale applications, scaling up to handle large flow rates and pressures presents engineering challenges. Designing robust and efficient Tesla pumps for industrial-scale operations requires careful optimization of electromagnetic coils, fluid dynamics, and heat dissipation.  Another challenge is the integration of Tesla pumps into existing fluid handling systems. Retrofitting traditional pumps with Tesla technology or designing new systems around Tesla pumps requires thorough planning and expertise. Compatibility with existing control systems, reliability under varying operating conditions, and seamless integration into process workflows are key considerations for successful implementation.  Looking ahead, the future of Tesla pump development holds promise for further innovation and advancements. Research efforts are focused on optimizing pump designs, exploring novel materials for enhanced performance, and investigating new applications in emerging fields such as microfluidics and biotechnology. Collaborations between academia, industry, and research institutions are essential to drive progress in Tesla pump technology and unlock its full potential across diverse sectors.  In conclusion, Tesla pump development represents a groundbreaking approach to fluid dynamics with implications for diverse industries and applications. By harnessing electromagnetic principles to propel and control fluid flow, Tesla pumps offer efficiency, precision, and sustainability advantages over traditional pump technologies. While challenges exist in scaling up and integrating Tesla pumps into existing systems, ongoing research and collaboration are paving the way for further advancements. With continued innovation and investment, Tesla pumps have the potential to transform fluid handling processes and set new standards for efficiency and performance in the years to come.""","751"
"6040","""The society of fifth century Athens could be described as one of the few slave societies that have existed in the world. It was a society in which the use of slaves was an everyday occurrence and it can be said that the economy and stability of the society relied on the use of slaves. Slaves in Athens, like women in Athens, were not classed as citizens and it can be asserted that they were not treated as human beings. There are many aspects of slavery that shed light on how slaves were treated. These are the amount of slaves in Athens, how the slavery was justified, whether the Athenians were cruel to their slaves, whether the slaves were considered to be less human than the free people of Athens and whether the comic characterisations of the treatment of slaves in the plays of Aristophanes are at all true. As fifth century Athens was a slave society we can safely say that there was a large number of slaves in Athens. There were in fact such a large number of slaves that it can be said that the Greeks could not imagine life without any slaves. The speech Lysias 4 which is written on behalf of a cripple suggests that even poor Athenians would have looked to own slaves and would have seen them as an investment in terms of income. When Aristotle presents his argument in support of slavery he mentions the 'master and slave' as natural elements within the household. This suggests that slavery was thought of as an essential and ordinary element in the Athenian household. There were different kinds of slaves in Athens, and therefore different slaves would have had different experiences with different masters and types of work. The public slaves and the skilled craftsmen may have experienced a more pleasant life compared to that of the miners who were often worked to death in appalling conditions, and the domestics slaves may have been able to forge relationships with their masters while agricultural slaves faced had work on the fields. V. Ehrenberg, The People of. 66 Lysias 4: On behalf of a cripple. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman slavery Aristotle, Politics,. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery Joint Association of Classical Teachers, The world of.87 Overall slavery as was never really questioned in the classical period as many Greeks could see no alternatives to slaves, there was therefore often no need for it to be justified. At the height of the sophistic period however, slavery was said to be against nature as it was primarily based upon force and morally wrong, and this led to Aristotle writing his justifications of slavery. Aristotle came up with many arguments as to why slavery was justified. He commented on how people were born, stating that some people were born to 'rule or be ruled', and therefore slavery was just and an advantage for the slave. There are many references to slaves as being an 'animate piece of property' and therefore they are meant to be owned and follow the commands of their owners. Many Greeks saw slaves as being one of the 'essential requirements of life' and thus made for slavery. The Pseudo-Aristotelian mentions three things that slaves are meant for as being 'work, punishment and food', this presents the slave as being designed for slavery and therefore by being a slave is fulfilling some sort of life purpose. Many slave owners believed they were justified in owning slaves because they were born into slave families or they were won in wars which were fought fairly. Joint Association of Classical Teachers, The world of.85/8 Joint Association of Classical Teachers, The world of.85/8 Aristotle, Politics,. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery Aristotle, Politics,. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery G. De Ste Croix. The Class struggle in the Ancient Greek. 40 G. De Ste Croix, The Class struggle in the Ancient Greek. 42 T.E.J. Wiedemann,.2 Athenians were in some ways cruel to their slaves. Slave owners could punish their slaves without fear of the law, this would have sometimes included harsh treatment. The flogging of slaves was a common occurrence, and even the most privileged of slaves could not be completely free from the threat of physical punishment. In Xenophon's The Householder, 2 it states 'you must not be frightened to punish', showing that slave discipline was seen as an important aspect of owning slaves. The private life of a slave depended on the master, the master could prevent his slaves from forming relationships, or split up families without the slaves having any say. Most slave owners would not treat their slaves too badly. Slaves were considered valuable property as they worked for their master and contributed to the household or the income, and therefore many slaves were looked after, or at least kept in good physical condition. However, not all slave owners would have been interested in looking after their slaves. In the speech Lysias, a man 'proposed that his own slaves should be interrogated under torture', this is showing a disregard for the condition of the slave as tortured slaves could be returned to their owners less able than before. T.E.J. Wiedemann,.3 N.R.E. Fisher, Slavery in Classical.0 Xenophon, The householder 2. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery N.R.E. Fisher, Slavery in Classical.2 G. De Ste Croix. The Class struggle in the Ancient Greek.42 Lysias: Speech about a premeditated wounding. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery In terms of the law, the rights of slaves were protected in some ways. Slaves are protected from being murdered. In Antiphon, a slave is murdered because he is accused of killing his master and his murders are told 'a jury's vote applies just as much to the man who kills a slave as to the man who kills a free man'. The law also protects slaves against Hybris. In Demosthenes 1, it states 'if anyone humiliates anyone, whether they are free or slave, or commits any illegal act against any of these, let any Athenian who has the right to do so and wishes submit their names to the Thesmothetai'. Although slaves are protected in these ways according to the law, they themselves cannot file a lawsuit and so they rely on others who are free. It is therefore debatable whether these laws were actually effective in the protection of slaves. Other laws such as that stating 'persons other than the slaves owner is not allowed to strike him' do not completely protect slaves, first the owner can still beat the slave and it will only protect the slave if the owner takes action when others beat the slave. Antiphon: Death of herodes. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery Demosthenes 1: Against meidias. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery D.M. MacDowell, The Law in Classical Athens, (London 978) P.1 It could be argued that the slaves in Athens could not have been treated too badly because of the lack of revolts against the slave owners, even though slavery was so common. However there is a logical explanation for this. Most of the slaves in Athens were 'barbarians' after it became illegal for Athenians to be enslaved in Athens after solon's reforms. The 'barbarians' were from many different areas such as Thrace, South Russia, Egypt and Sicily, this meant they often shared no common language or culture and were thus unable to organise an uprising. N.R.E. Fisher, Slavery in Classical.2 G. De Ste Croix. The Class struggle in the Ancient Greek.42 In some ways slaves in fifth century Athens were considered less human than the free people. As Aristotle states ' the polarity between 'slave' and 'free' seemed as natural a way of dividing up the human race as those between men and women or young and old'. Aristotle sums up the attitude of fifth century Athens well as the opposite to free was considered to be slavery, rather than imprisonment as in our modern society. There were many ways in which slaves were dehumanised. They are referred to as 'property' and compared to 'wild beasts', suggesting that they are a lower life form than the free men. Slaves were also prevented from doing what is natural such as forming relationships and having children, this put them lower than the rest of society. Slaves were also not allowed to give evidence at a lawsuit unless it was extracted while under torture, and many dehumanising devices were used such as referring to adult male slaves a 'boy'. However, some Athenians would have seen slaves as human as shown in Xenophon 'Slaves have no less need of something good to hope for than do free men'. This shows an acknowledge meant that slaves have the same hopes as all other people rather than not being able to think like suggested by others such as Aristotle when he brands slaves as incapable of all independent reasoning. I believe that Demosthenes sums up the reality for slaves when he states that 'the greatest difference between the slave and the free man is that the former is answerable with his body for all offences'. Aristotle, Politics,. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery Xenophon, The householder 3. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery Xenophon, The householder. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery M.I. Finley, Ancient Slavery and modern.6 Xenophon, The householder. In T. Wiedemann, Greek and Roman Slavery P. Cartledge, The Greeks: A Portrait of Self and.25/8 M.I. Finley, Ancient Slavery and modern.3 Slaves are often presented in comedy, particularly by play writers such as Aristophanes who uses frequent comic characterisations of slaves. The slaves in the many plays set in fifth century Athens can hardly be said to give accurate descriptions of how slaves were treated at the time due to the fact that it is a comedy, designed to make an audience of the time laugh rather than a documentary. The slaves that Aristophanes presents are developed from the true slave of the time, but certain features have been exaggerated. The Aristophanic play 'frogs' gives us many situations with slaves such as when the slave offers his master, who he is changed clothes with, up for torture. This shows us that torture was probably not commonly used. There is another scene in 'frogs' in which two slaves talk about how they curse their master behind his back as well as pry and eavesdrop. Slaves probably did engage in these activities but it was probably more exaggerated in the play. V. Ehrenberg, The People of Aristophanes, (Blackwell 95/81) P.70 V. Ehrenberg, The People of Aristophanes, (Blackwell 95/81) P.87 V. Ehrenberg, The People of Aristophanes, (Blackwell 95/81) P.87 Aristophanes frogs Act two Overall I believe that slaves were not treated as humans. Although there were limited laws in place to protect the rights of slave, these were only useful if the slaves master or another citizen was willing to file a lawsuit, and slaves were often not deemed important enough to go to the trouble. The power the masters had over the slaves and the various methods of dehumanisation further took away the character and the personality of a slave so that they were barely human. Although some slaves may have been treated well by their masters, the masters had two much power over their slaves, and society too many restrictions to allow slaves to live as proper humans.""","""Athenian Slavery in Fifth Century""","2400","""Slavery in fifth-century Athens was a pervasive and essential element of Athenian society, shaping various aspects of life for both slaves and citizens. The institution of slavery was deeply ingrained in the fabric of Athenian culture, with slaves accounting for a significant portion of the population. This system of forced labor had profound implications for the economy, politics, and social structure of ancient Athens.  In fifth-century Athens, slaves were considered property, devoid of personal freedoms or rights. They were owned by individual citizens, wealthy households, or the state, and their primary function was to provide labor in various capacities. Slaves performed a wide range of tasks, including domestic work, agricultural labor, crafts, and even skilled professions such as teaching and medicine. They were a crucial workforce that contributed to the economic prosperity of Athens.  The legal status of slaves in Athens was starkly different from that of free citizens. Slaves had no legal standing and were entirely at the mercy of their owners. Masters held absolute power over their slaves, with the authority to dictate their daily activities, punish them physically, and even decide their life and death. The vulnerability of slaves to exploitation and abuse was a fundamental aspect of their existence in Athenian society.  Despite their subjugated status, slaves in Athens were not a homogenous group. There were variations in the treatment and conditions of slaves based on factors such as their skills, responsibilities, and the nature of their work. Some slaves enjoyed relatively better living conditions and privileges, especially those who served in skilled or trusted roles within a household. However, the overarching reality for most slaves was one of hardship, oppression, and limited prospects for a better life.  The role of slavery in the Athenian economy cannot be overstated. The labor provided by slaves was essential for the functioning of households, agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. Slaves were a valuable resource that enabled Athenian citizens to engage in intellectual pursuits, participate in democratic governance, and enjoy a leisurely lifestyle. The economic prosperity of Athens was sustained by the uncompensated labor of slaves, who formed the backbone of the workforce in various sectors of the city-state.  The prevalence of slavery also had implications for the social structure and dynamics of Athenian society. The institution of slavery created a hierarchical system that stratified the population based on status and power. Citizens, who were free and had political rights, occupied the highest position in this social hierarchy. Slaves, at the bottom of the hierarchy, were marginalized and disenfranchised, existing on the fringes of Athenian society.  Despite the pervasive nature of slavery in fifth-century Athens, there were instances of resistance and attempts to challenge the existing power dynamics. Some slaves engaged in acts of rebellion, disobedience, or escape, seeking to assert their agency and challenge the authority of their masters. These acts of resistance, though risky and often met with harsh consequences, highlight the innate human desire for freedom and dignity, even in the most oppressive circumstances.  The perception of slavery in Athenian society was complex and multifaceted. While some Athenians justified slavery on grounds of necessity, economic benefit, or even natural hierarchy, others expressed moral qualms and ethical concerns about the institution. Philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle debated the ethics of slavery, raising questions about the inherent worth and dignity of human beings, regardless of their status or circumstances.  In conclusion, slavery in fifth-century Athens was a foundational institution that fundamentally shaped the political, economic, and social landscape of the city-state. The system of forced labor provided the necessary workforce for the functioning of Athenian society, while also perpetuating inequality, exploitation, and injustice. The legacy of slavery in Athens serves as a reminder of the complexities of human history, the enduring struggle for freedom and equality, and the profound impact of systems of oppression on individuals and communities.""","766"
"252","""The first Africans to land on American soil were brought over in a Dutch frigate in 619. The tiny proportion of attention this event receives in contemporary sources suggests a total lack of awareness by North American settlers of the huge effect this people would come to have on the development of the American nation. Evidence about the status of such early arrivals remains sketchy and thus debate has continued to rage among historians as to what exactly caused Africans in the Americas to become an enslaved people. The main thrust of the debate focuses upon whether economic factors, largely the need for a reliable labour force, were really the key issue at hand in causing the enslavement of Africans. The alternate argument, brought closer to central stage by the attention paid to racial history in recent years, suggests that American settlers saw 'African' as meaning 'slave' because of the debasement they believed inherent in the African race. This argument entertains complex ideas of racial politics that frequently intertwine with economic considerations: to unravel such ideas in order to understand slavery's origins is the aim here. It has often been argued that the forced migration and enslavement of Africans in the New World was simply the direct result of a 'seemingly inexhaustible' demand for labour in developing colonial settlement areas like New England and Virginia. In all of those parts of North America settled upon by European migrants, land was readily available and cheap to buy, including to those who would have made up the labouring population back in their native countries. In addition, in order to survive colonialists needed to develop staple cash crops that could be exported back to Europe, crops that would require a large, non-migratory workforce to grow successfully. Klein suggests that the lack of accessible labour in colonial North America was a two-fold problem caused by the unwillingness of the European 'labouring classes' to migrate, and also by the nomadic nature of the native population. Unlike the Spanish who arrived in central and southern America, settlers in the North did not discover established agriculturalist societies but instead semi-migratory tribes who would thus be difficult to integrate into colonial society. Indentured servants brought over with European migrants offered one solution, albeit a rather unsatisfactory one. Although they could provide cheap labour over a given period, indentured servants became free men on the expiration of their contracted period of servitude. This not only meant that the labour force had to be continually replaced, but also exacerbated the shortages when freed servants became landowners themselves. It would appear then that there was 'no possibility that the supply would satisfy the demand' if no other solution were found. Klein, Herbert S., 'Patterns of Settlement of the Afro-American Population in the New World' in Nathan I. Huggins, Martin Kilson and Daniel M. Fox, Key Issues in the Afro-American have and enjoy all such rights liberties immunities priviledges and free customs within this Province as any naturall born subject of England.' The mention of slavery in such legal documentation suggests its growing establishment in colonial society. Ib id., p.5/8 Henretta, James A. and Nobles, Gregory H., Evolution and Revolution: American Society, 600- their difference in society, and other evidence confirms this distinction. For example, white female servants were rarely allowed to undertake fieldwork at this time, whereas black females were, something likely to explain the higher price paid for an African female servant. Similarly the language of horror and disgust used in contemporary pieces concerning the sexual union of black and white emphasises their innate separateness. For instance, a Virginia man was sentenced to whipping for 'abusing himself to the dishonour of God and shame of Chrisitians, by defiling his body in lying with a Negro.' It would appear then that at the same time as the key features of slavery were were notions surrounding the inferiority of the Negro race. This, in turn, means that racism can hardly have caused the emergence of slavery. In doing so such concepts of difference and inferiority would need to have been in place well before slavery developed in practice. Jordan, ''The Mutual Causation' of Racism and Slavery', p.7. Such complex interactions have led some historians, namely Winthrop D. Jordan to take on the idea that racism and slavery were mutually causal, constantly acting upon one another to increase the general debasement of the African in American colonial society. Economic factors such as the need for a stable labour force may have played a role, but the demarcation of the African as slave rather than servant is evidence enough that some form of discrimination was essential in the emergence of this institution. If this prejudice was not in its totality caused by inherent racism, as I have argued, then a further factor must be brought into the debate. This I believe is the importance of race as a culturally and historically specific concept. Berlin, Ira, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 998), pp.-. Even from the earliest European migrations the concept of 'whiteness' was culturally loaded, containing far more than simply a notion of colour. Particularly for the English settlers, to be white meant also to be Christian and to be civilised, something that equated itself to freedom through common law. This explains why the English were capable of viewing other European settlers with disdain, and as holding a lower status, without reducing them to slaves. Africans represented the exact opposite of what it meant to be 'white' and also therefore what it meant to be deserving of freedom. Such opposition was not achieved simply through race in the traditional sense as meaning colour, but also through something historians have called the 'heathen condition'. This incorporated the ideas Europeans had picked up through historical experience of religious wars, that to be Christian was the norm and therefore to define anything outside as an 'other'. Africans were 'others' in every sense of the word: heathen rather than Christian, black rather than white and, it seems in a context where to employ the concept in full would be beneficial such as this one, bonded rather than free. That the inauguration of slavery into colonial society is linked to religion ought hardly to be surprising given the extent to which European, particularly English, migration was the result of religious factors. As the importance of religion declined in these societies, so it would seem did religion as a justification for slavery, hence why eventually conversion of slaves to Christianity was allowed. I would argue that it is only after this point that racism become key as an independent cause, well after slavery had been established as an institution. Jordan, The White Man's Burden, pp.0-2. Wood, Peter H., Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 670 through the Stono Rebellion (New York; London: W.W. Norton and Company, 974), p.8. In summing up this debate on the causes of African enslavement in the New World colonies it seems one must split conclusions into three distinct categories. Firstly, were economic factors important in causing the emergence of slavery? The answer here is most certainly that yes they were important but probably not the crucial deciding factor. Without the demand for a labour force that had such distinct characteristics, to be non-migratory, cheap, stable, and in abundance, Africans may well have been an unnecessary addition to colonial society. However this need does not explain why it was only black Africans who were enslaved, and it is for this reason that race becomes important. Secondly then, to what extent is racism important? In the traditional sense as meaning purely colour I would argue that race alone cannot account for the enslavement of Africans. This is because historians have as yet been unable to guarantee that racism emerged before slavery, while some in fact even considering its opposite, that racism was its consequence. Evidence of an increasing society of 'difference' emerges during the 640s at the same time as slavery itself appears to have become established. Thus it appears that while the institution of slavery and the notion of race discrimination may have operated alongside one another to encourage the general debasement of the African, racism cannot account for slavery's initial growth. In order to find the real igniting factor then it seems one must consider race as a culture-specific term. Thus in the European sense, to deserve freedom was a feature of the 'white' race not in terms of colour exclusively but of being civilised and Christian. Only in this sense can one understand why the African was debased enough in the New World to allow for his freedom to be degraded in this manner. So in conclusion, were economic factors or those concerning race more important in causing African slavery? It would seem that while the need for labour was certainly a crucial factor in guiding the direction of debasement, its role was a supporting one. Race, but only when considered wholly as a culturally loaded term, was the key causal factor in the development of slavery because as an institution it was never an isolated economic phenomenon, instead part of a general debasement of the African in colonial society.""","""Origins of African Slavery in America""","1854","""The origins of African slavery in America trace back to the early colonial period when European settlers sought cheap labor for their agricultural enterprises. While the practice of slavery was not new, it took on a different dimension in the Americas due to the transatlantic slave trade.   European nations, primarily Portugal, Spain, France, and later England, established colonies in the Americas and quickly realized the need for a large workforce to cultivate cash crops such as sugar, tobacco, cotton, and indigo. These crops required extensive labor, leading to the systematic enslavement of Africans to meet the demand.   The transatlantic slave trade, also known as the Middle Passage, involved the forced migration of millions of Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas. European slave traders captured Africans from various regions of the continent, predominantly West and Central Africa, and transported them under horrific conditions to be sold as slaves in the colonies. This brutal practice forcibly displaced millions of Africans from their homelands and subjected them to inhumane treatment.  The enslaved Africans faced unimaginable hardships during the Middle Passage, enduring overcrowded and unsanitary conditions onboard slave ships. Many did not survive the voyage, succumbing to disease, malnutrition, and violence. Those who did arrive in the Americas were sold at auctions to plantation owners and subjected to a lifetime of servitude.  Slavery in America was codified through laws that stripped enslaved Africans of their basic human rights and treated them as property. The institution of slavery was deeply entrenched in the economic, social, and political fabric of the American colonies, shaping the development of the nation for centuries to come.  The enslaved Africans were subjected to backbreaking labor on plantations, enduring cruel treatment, physical abuse, and harsh living conditions. Families were torn apart as children were separated from parents, spouses from each other, highlighting the dehumanizing nature of slavery.  Resistance to slavery was present from the beginning, with enslaved Africans engaging in acts of defiance, sabotage, and rebellion to assert their humanity and fight for freedom. From individual acts of rebellion to organized revolts such as the Stono Rebellion in 1739 and the Haitian Revolution in 1791, enslaved Africans resisted their oppression in varied ways.  Despite the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in 1808 and the eventual end of slavery in the United States with the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, the legacy of African slavery continues to impact American society today. The trauma and injustices inflicted on enslaved Africans and their descendants have had lasting effects on issues of race, inequality, and social justice.  In conclusion, the origins of African slavery in America are rooted in the economic interests of European colonial powers and the dehumanization of African peoples for labor exploitation. The transatlantic slave trade and the brutal conditions endured by enslaved Africans shaped the course of American history and continue to resonate in contemporary discussions on race and social equity. Understanding this dark chapter in history is crucial for acknowledging the injustices of the past and working towards a more just and equitable future.""","610"

Certain job profiles can be differentiated. They best describe the nature and the scope of work that in most circumstances are undertaken by an individual working for either of the design ventures. Company Director In both cases the company founders had best fitted this job description. Usually, they had a managerial role overseeing all of the projects the business was working on, engaging in company finance and raising company profile. In terms of day to day activities this meant that directors would have frequent meetings with project leaders, a weekly meeting with the office accountant and would serve as a forefront of the business. The latter activity encompassed: creating company public relation work; such as public lectures and media exposure forging links with other professionals working in the field of built environment as a way of ensuring the company can develop knowledge and is able to offer innovative solutions before other market competitors forging links with the potential clients as a way of securing new commissions for sustaining the business and as a way to stir the company towards commissions that will help it to evolve in a wanted direction However, the directors both within White Design Associates and Thomas Heatherwick studio would occasionally engage in a particular project if: there had been a pressure to deliver certain outputs in a short time periodthere were any disputes between professional organisations there were any major financial issues that may have an impact on the future of a projectEven though there are a lot of similarities between the activities of company directors of both places where I had been working, there were some divergences too. Namely, within Thomas Heatherwick studio there were other job profiles that complemented and supported the activities of the director such as office administrator and company marketing assistant. On the other hand White Design Associates did not have these job positions and much of the administrative and marketing work has been done or overseen by one of the directors. Projects ManagerA person who has been working within the practice the longest would have taken up this role. usually manage a particular project himself. At the same time, he would also serve as a support for project architects giving them advise or providing them with help related to running a job. This is because a projects manager had the most insight into the way building industry operates and the way that company preferred to deliver projects. Apart from running a particular job himself, his role within White Design Associates or Thomas Heatherwick Studio was to: help out company directors particularly in tasks related to raising company profileconsult with company development strategyadvise project architects about design developmentnegotiate with project architects the distribution of work for different projectsThere were not major differences between the activities of people who fitted this job profile in White Design Associates and Thomas Heatherwick Studio. Project Architect/Project DesignerProject architect or project be the person in charge of running one or several projects from the early stages up to their completion. They would be engaged in usual activities that relate to the stages of development process from developing design options up to hand over of the finished project. Within White Design Associates, people undertaking this job had a high degree of independence in terms that the input of directors or projects manger would be limited to the very initial stages of the process. Only if the project was facing difficulties or if project architect felt that he or she needed advice or help from senior team members would they get involved. On the other hand, due to different approach to design process at Thomas Heatherwick Studio, project designers had, to an extent a lesser degree of independent decision making. Because company director had developed personal approach to design, the project could change or shift due to director's changing attitude towards the project. Within both practices, project architects and designers would also be involved in some administrative work, such as preparing bid submissions. Architectural Assistant/InternThis job description best fitted the work that I had been undertaking. Within the offices that I worked for the responsibilities and tasks varied significantly. Within White Design Associates, an architectural assistant would usually be allocated to one project architect. Together they would form a team and work on delivery of a single project, with project architect having a senior role. However, the assistant would be exposed to all stages of building development either directly as a participant in the workload, or indirectly by observing the tasks that project architect is undertaking. Coupled with that, this job position would usually include a responsibility for a smaller - scale development that the office is engaged with. In this situation the assistant would implement the knowledge gained through the collaboration with project architect and to an extent, act as a project architect himself. This process would be overseen and guided by company director. In personal case, I have been allocated a development of a 0m2 artist studio building. Architectural assistant would also act as a support member of staff carrying out administrative tasks and sharing the workload with other project architects. In the case of Thomas Heatherwick Studio, due to limited time that an intern spends at the investment in individual development cannot be carried out to such an extent. Usually, a person is also allocated to a project designer. However, because of a small time period that he or she is going to be spending with the office, an intern is rarely involved with a single project from beginning until its completion. Therefore, he or she is more likely to take up a general support role within the office. Office Administrator and Marketing AssistantThis job positions existed in Thomas Heatherwick Studio, whilst the crux of this type of work has been divided between one company director and most members of staff working for White Design Associates. The activities of these two job positions include: organising and managing director's diarymanaging invoicingmanaging company overheadsproviding technical support and organising events that would help raising company profileOffice management strategies of White Design Associates and Thomas Heatherwick StudioThis section of text focuses on the approach each of the offices had toward different activities that were undertaken by them. Crudely, they can be divided into the following segments: Design DevelopmentWork Acquirement and Client BaseMarketing StrategyCollaboration StrategyQuality Standards of Work OutputDesign DevelopmentDesign development process can be defined as a period of time spent between the moment a client appoints the office to undertake certain project until the point the preferred design solution has been submitted to Development Control. At this stage of process, the following items would be agreed with a client: size, appearance and arrangement of a structurestructural system that is likely to be usedbuilding programmepreliminary cost estimate of projectThe way in which the design options would have been developed within the practices that I had been working for was significantly different. White Design Associates tended to reduce this period to a minimum. In other words, the initial options would be developed within several weeks. This could have been achieved because the practice championed a limited number of construction were based in the city. Apart from having tangible resources to finance projects themselves, these organisations can serve as a platform for establishing link between design/art industry and potential clients. Also, company director had dedicated a lot of time for public promotions such as media exposure and lectures. The marketing assistant who was pro actively engaging with various media organisations and public forms supported these activities. Marketing Strategy Companies that I had been working for had an awareness of the need to pitch their services in a certain way. This meant that both offered a particular type of product. White Design Associates developed Re-Thinking Space as a product. Collaborating with developers Willmott Dixon and VELUX window manufacturing company, they were offering a 'building package' (named Re-Thinking Space); whereby client would be purchasing a system solution with pre determined building components and environmental systems. The solution would be adapted to particular needs and would be based on timber clad, glue laminated frame structure that is well insulated and naturally ventilated. In this way, White Design's architectural solution was set against standard development market. It was, in a way, subverting the methods used by major developers whereby the standardised solutions are marketed as a guarantee of financial viability and 'buildability' of a particular scheme. Hereby, White Design was instilling confidence in potential clients by showing that it can deliver design that has within itself integrated certain can be delivered without having an impact on the project budget. Whilst White Design concentrated on publicly promoting their innovation through building industry, Thomas Heatherwick Studio was keen to show its work in a different light. It was promoting the diversity of design. Also it ensured that each employee could be engaged in a piece of work at any stage of its development. On the other hand, Thomas Heatherwick Studio had developed an information storage system both in terms of hard copies and electronic was similar to the one of White Design Associates. However, they did not develop templates and the system of referencing/cross - referencing of information to the extent that the other practice did. Conclusions about an architectural practice as a business ventureI will try to draw out conclusions I have reached about the factors that contribute to successfully running an architectural or a design practice. These conclusions are by no means definite and comprehensive, because I have drawn them from personal and limited experience. Predominantly, I have reached them by observing the way the practices I worked for had been organised and by observing various strategies they had employed, which I had touched upon in the previous paragraphs. From this analysis I have tried to extract some issues and themes that I thought were important to bear in mind when thinking about architecture as business venture in current cultural context. Within next paragraphs, I hope to elaborate on the following themes I became aware of: understanding co - relation between design approach and client baseunderstanding the difference between private and public sector fundingprofitability of various design activitiespractice efficiency Understanding co - relation between design approach and client baseWhilst working at White Design Associates and Thomas Heatherwick studio, I gradually became aware of how design approach and client base are strongly related. In other words, the type of product or service that a company is offering is likely to be appealing to a certain sections of market. Therefore, it is likely that a company is going to get increasingly engaged with a specific type of demands. As the result, the company is going to adjust its activities and its strategies towards meeting that demand. Diagram shows how previously mentioned company strategies have resulted from this dialogue between design approach and client base, in the case of White Design Associates and Thomas Heatherwick Studio. Standardised solutions and strong environmental ethos of White Design particularly resonated with local authorities and organisations that themselves were involved in sustainable production or environmental protection. They would be more interested in buildings that were the example of practices than in other aspects of building design. As the result, the office concentrated on developing and researching building methods such as glue laminated structures or prefabricated straw bale panels. Equally, it was occupied with developing a database of environmentally friendly building products and materials. On the other hand, it meant it was less interested in other building technologies, particularly the ones related to steel frame systems or glazed envelopes. Similarly, other design themes such as physical context or the analysis of the locality of a development were having somewhat lesser importance. Thomas Heatherwick Studio's output seemed to attract either cultural or commercial establishments. As designs would usually have very strong formal qualities and uniqueness both in form and in materials, they would attract clients who wanted strong and. In my personal opinion, the studio's output was corresponding to the branding strategies of various organisations. Therefore the practice paid particular attention to formal research and the use of materials in an innovative way. However, this also meant that some practical design issues, such as accessibility or environmental and servicing solutions, would be sometimes overlooked. This is not to say that the practices were only having these types of commissions and these types of design responses. However, the crux of their workload corresponded to the above mentioned patterns. In any case, I believe that, in a sense, these practices were responding to and anticipating the client base successfully through their activities. I think that it is increasingly important to understand the practice - client base co-relation, particularly in the case of emerging businesses. Any new architectural company should from the outset offer service which is in a way specific and which will differentiate it from other market competitors. More importantly, the practice should also have a clear idea about who is their target audience, as well. Understanding the difference between private and public sector fundingBy observing relationship between resources put into bid submissions and their outcomes I became aware of this issue. Namely, at White Design Associates I have been involved in compiling a number of tender a period of one year. These bids would take usually several days to be produced by at least two members of staff. Statistically, the company was more often unsuccessful in terms of securing the jobs in this way. The limiting factors would be either: Relative inexperience of practice in the delivery of similar projects that a bid asks forRelatively small turnover/liability insurance Size of practiceIt became clear to me that the priority of public sector funding is the security of investment more than just the quality of design. Or to be more precise, public sector would choose a preferred design solution once it has narrowed down the applicants to the ones that have the proven track record of similar projects and that are big enough to deal with financial or workload implications if the project runs into problems. Even though one can argue that some of these choice criteria are not really a safeguard for public investment at all, the reality is that a practice has a slim chance of securing the job in this way unless it has a proven track record. As the result, understanding public sector funding can help a new practice not to waste its resources in certain types of tendering processes. On the other hand, Thomas Heatherwick Studio, was a practice in a similar situation, whereby it had a number of projects executed but that was comparatively small output in relation to large and well established design companies. However, it concentrated its resources into trying to acquire privately funded commissions. In a way, for a developing company this is probably more profitable strategy. As private clients can be more prone to risk taking and are likely to invite small number of practices they find suitable to bid for a job. Thus, the practice stands much higher chances of gaining new work. Profitability of various design activitiesDuring the period of a couple of months when White Design Associates were having work deficit, I became aware of the problem that a traditional architectural practice has when facing the lack of work. Namely, the time span a traditional practice can sustain itself without commissions cannot be more than a few months. In my opinion, the workload/profit ratio is much smaller in the field of architecture than in other design fields. That is why I believe Thomas Heatherwick Studio had better financial base, because apart from architecture it ventured into other design fields. As the result, it would have public art or product design commissions that had similar budgets to architectural projects. Yet the profit margin would have been much greater because the process of development of these projects involve less professionals that need to be paid from the budget. Also, it would take a project designer much less time and fewer resources to carry a project through to its final stages than it would take to complete a building development. Therefore I believe that by offering a variety of design services and being aware of their actual profitability is a key to sustaining a business, particularly through the rough patches. Practice Efficiency During the time spent in practice I became aware of the importance of this issue. Particularly this may be in the case of developing design businesses that have more limited resources that need to be utilised in the best way possible. As I have mentioned before, I was particularly stricken by clear and concise way the project tasks would be dealt with by White Design Associates. This is mainly due to their design development strategy, constant collaboration with other built environment professionals and partnership with a main contractor. As the result, projects would have consistency and yet they would not be churned out like on the production line conveyor belt. Therefore, the practice would spend much less time one a single project than it would usually take for a development of similar size. For example, the practice was able to deliver a primary school within nine months. Also, it was delivered by one project architect with a limited help from an architectural assistant. As a knock on effect of quick project delivery, the practice was able to increase its output in comparison to the offices of a similar size. These devised approaches to an integrated design development and construction management were equally beneficial to new members of staff. They could quickly learn the process that the office used to develop and deliver a building. This meant that it would take less time to integrate new employees into the team. This integration was also supported by the devised quality standards systems that have been mentioned. SECTION - Practical knowledge gained from working at White Design Associates and Thomas Heatherwick StudioApart from getting general insight into architecture and design as a from business venture, I have also gained or developed particular skills during the time spent in practice. These can be defined as tasks that I have been introduced to and that I have executed individually or as a part of an office team. The following section concentrates on these tasks. Rather than focusing on individual projects or on project stages as defined by RIBA Plan of Work, I will try to indicate how each of the mentioned skills developed through my involvement in various projects. The reasons for organising the section in this manner are twofold. Firstly, the small - scale project that I have managed did not go through the development stages as defined by Plan of Work due to its size. Therefore, trying to organise my experience according to this plan would be difficult, as the actual stages of project development in some instances have significantly parted from it. Secondly, as I have been doing similar tasks on various projects, organising the section according to projects would mean that many observations would be unnecessarily repeated. Hence, the following paragraphs elaborate on particular skills. Projects that are cited within the main body of the text are briefly described within the Appendix. The skills have been placed into three categories. These are: technical skillsmanagerial skillsknowledge of legal issues Technical skillsThese skills, for the purpose of the essay encompass activities undertaken by an architect or a team of architects in order to ensure that the design can be and that it is executed as it has been envisaged. They can be divided into activities such as: drawingproduction of information packages surveying DrawingFrom the very outset of my work experience I have been exposed to understanding the importance of drawing hierarchy. Whilst at the university level drawings are used as a device solely to communicate ideas, in practice they are more important as a guide or a manual to the construction process. Therefore, even though each drawing explains certain part of that process, together they represent one coherent totality. One of my first tasks upon arriving at White Design Associates was to develop reflected ceiling services layout and the layouts of toilet facilities on a Kingsmead primary school project. I have quickly learned the importance of a master drawing as a common denominator for all the others. By taking parts of it, I was able to scale them up and create new drawings by adding more detailed information, such as piping/ducting routes, types of light fittings, smoke detectors and sanitary components. Using the master drawing as a departure point meant that several people can share the workload and produce work that is complementary, most importantly in terms of measurements. At this point, I also became aware of four categories of positioning cladding boards around the outlined building shape and then to work inwards; drawing structural timber studs and dimensioning windows so that they are multiples of a cladding board. Another project has also taught me the importance of this activity. On Anns Grove primary school development the working sections of the building needed to be drawn, yet the project architect solely responsible for the development had to go on holiday. The rest of employees who had to engage in the project for the first time, divided the workload for these drawings. However, as the project architect has created templates with guidelines indicating crucial dimensions the tasks of drafting up these sections was not as onerous as it could have been. Compiling drawing schedules was another activity that I had been exposed to. Namely I had to compile several of them on various projects: window and door schedule on Yanley Lane studio development and on Kingsmead primary school project; ironmongery schedule on Kingsmead primary school and on Hengistbury Head classroom of the future project. Even though this activity seems pretty straight - forward I have realised the possible implications should a schedule have mistakes. Because windows and doors are one of the biggest expenses and the delivery times can be measured in months, the mistakes can both push back the completion date and turn to be very costly. For example, the cost of windows was the second most expensive item on the bill of quantities for Yanley Lane development and it took more than ten weeks for their delivery. Production of information packages Apart from drawing, architects have to communicate certain issues by compiling documents. I had to compile several information packages. On Yanley Lane studio building, I had to submit a written report to the client. It concentrated on resolving some critical issues before the project was to be started on site. Because of topography, it would turn too costly for the studio to be linked to the main sewerage system, as the building was planed to be downhill from it. As the result I have researched into several sewerage system options, citing in report the cost and the design implication of all of them. Also, the report has concentrated on the relation of window sizes to the overall cost of the project. It is important to make design process as transparent as possible. Drawings are good tool to explain a building, but I felt that they could not explain some issues, particularly to clients who may have not engaged in the process of development beforehand. Another instance when I had incorporated drawings in more comprehensive documents was when submitting a design for planning approval. I felt that, apart from filling in necessary forms and sending through the drawings showing the development, it is important to create a written explanation on certain design features and show how the development responds to development plans. By doing so on Yanley Lane studio and Stanpit Marsh visitor centre submissions, the planning approval came within statutory time period. Delays in planning approval can have a significant impact on the work schedule. This often may be due to misunderstanding between the architect and local authority. It is through these reports that some issues are clarified. Also, they can serve to open up a constructive discussion between these two parties, which helps in resolving problems. I have also been involved in creating documents such as tendering specifications, whereby I have learnt the importance of cross - referencing specification clauses and component drawings. For example, I have been given to do the NBS specification section on sanitary - ware for the Hengistbury Head Classroom of the Future project and relate it to specific drawings. By citing specification clause on drawings and vice versa, the information is much more legible to the contractor and subcontractors. This may fractionally speed up the construction process. SurveyingSurveying encompasses activities such as site surveying, site investigation and site inspection. To various degrees, I have been involved in all them. Namely, in terms of architectural survey I have conducted it with senior colleagues on Yanley Lane project and Friezecroft Avenue redevelopment. It thought me the importance of spending enough time on site doing a thorough measurement and investigation, as mistakes at this early stage could not be apparent straight way and are likely to surface much later in the project. For example, because of not fixing a datum point on site from which the relative building dimensions are measured, a problem has emerged during the construction of Yanley Lane studio. As steel shoes that supported the building were higher than as drawn, and because the floor construction change was not taken into account the building was higher by 00mm than allowed by the authorities. Unfortunately, as the datum point from which the heights were measured was not set, the problem had not been solved until the stud frame and rafters were up. This meant that the studs had to be shortened adding labour time and labour cost. I have witnessed the site investigation by structural engineer collaborating on Yanley Lane studio development. Even though the building used lightweight construction, six trial pits were dug to determine the strength of the subsoil. Implicitly and through the discussion with an engineer I became aware of issues related to this tasks. In many cases the strength of soil, which determines the foundation size and type is an unknown until the construction starts on site. The soil excavation can create serious problems as the trial pits may not always determine all the issues related to foundation design. Finally, I have participated on site inspections both on Yanley Lane project where I have conducted few on my own, and on Kingsmead primary school as an observer. Due to the small size of studio development and because of close collaboration with the main contractor, these visits would usually be of informative nature. I would agree small amendments with the contractor or I would just observe the construction progress. I think I would need more experience with projects on site to be able to draw informed conclusions. Managerial skillsApart from being involved in specific tasks, an architect also has to collaborate with other parties involved in process of development. He or she may be put in the position to oversee the overall output of a design team and contractors. Therefore, negotiation and organisational skills need to be acquired in order to be able to successfully run a project. During my time spent in practice I have been in position where I could have started developing some of them. However, this is probably the most difficult part of an architect's job and at the same time, the one that is based on significant experience. Therefore I am aware that I would probably need several more years spent in practice to fully develop them. In my case, I have had a chance to engage in managing the bill of quantities, manage design integration and to be involved in design team/client meetings. Managing bill of quantitiesAs mentioned before, Yanley Lane Studio Development was small in size. The parties involved in its development were a client, the architectural practice and a specialist timber construction contractor. The involved contractor would usually offer design and build services for small - scale timber structure developments. It was suggested to the client that White Design Associates could develop the design in collaboration with this company, utilising their knowledge of timber construction methods. Afterwards, the building contract would be awarded to this building firm. Clients were also encouraged to get another independent cost estimate for the agreed design as a safeguard for them. Therefore, the project did not go through more traditional procurement paths (Chappell and Willis, 000). As the result of the simplicity of the development set up, the professional boundaries were blurred to an extent. This meant that White Design Associates were responsible for obtaining final prices for several construction items that were outside the scope of services provided by the contractor. Namely, these were fixing the price of windows and the price of roof membrane. I have spent significant amount of time negotiating these items with the suppliers. However, I think I have learned a lot from the process. For example, the roof design featured timber boards as roof cladding material. These boards had to be fixed to the main roof structure comprising rafters, plywood sheet cover and EDPM roof membrane. The only way of connecting cladding boards to the roof structure was by using timber battens, yet the batten fixings would penetrate the rubber membrane. Another set of EPDM strips had to be added to cover battens and provide extra protection. This has resulted in getting price estimates for roof membrane up to five times higher than it was provisionally allowed for this item. This alone would mean increase in project cost by 0%, which was unacceptable. After several months spent negotiating with various EPDM manufacturers and installers, I have managed to negotiate a satisfactory solution with one company. The company was able to produce single sheet roof membrane with rubber flaps spaced to correspond to the spacing of battens. The battens could be tucked under the flaps, reducing the installation time, and more importantly reducing the cost. Hence, the EPDM membrane supply and fixing was returned to the original estimate. More than anything this has taught me the value of creative process. In order to achieve good design solution, an architect has to be inventive in every stage of the development process. Managing design integrationEven though it is an architect's technical skill to integrate information from various consultants into information packages, in personal opinion, this activity has an important managerial aspect too. During the time I spent working on Yanley Lane project, and by supporting project architect developing Kingsmead primary school, I have realised that an architect has to oversee the activities of the consultants. Particularly in the case of more complex designs that go through numerous changes, it is important to ensure that all of the design team is aware of all of them. On few occasions I have noticed that the delays would be created just because a team member has developed a solution that did not take into account latest agreed design changes. Knowledge of legal issuesFinally, I have implicitly became aware of the vast field of legal issues that an architect has to engage in. As I have not been in the position to sign the contracts I could only observe the work done by senior colleagues within this field. I have looked through the standard contract - RIBA small works to familiarise myself as it was used on Yanley Lane studio development. Also, I have learnt the appointment procedures that White Design Associates used when undertaking new work, which was in line with the explanations of this process that can be found in professional literature (Green, 001). Also, White Design Associates used mainly partnering arrangements and ventured into variations of design and build procurement paths with a major construction company. Because my knowledge within this file is limited in scope, I could only draw a simple conclusion. Namely, that the contractual arrangements have strong influence on the nature of process of development; different types of contract favour different agendas, such as quick construction, design quality or cost certainty. An architect has to have a clear picture of a client's needs and the office ethos in order to be able to negotiate the best possible contractual solution. Future aspirationsThis essay has helped me not just to organise my experience, but also to realise the strong points and the weaknesses of my knowledge and skills. I guess that when going back to the academic world, in my case doing the diploma course at Oxford Brookes University, one should not regard it as a 'cut off' point. Even tough the tasks performed at the university are not part of a 'real' project they should be dealt with as they would be in practice. Therefore, I am hoping to use the technical skills acquired in my years out within studio projects. In this way apart from thinking about conceptual design solutions, I hope to be able to engage in incorporating structures and servicing into proposed schemes. As managing Yanley Lane studio development has taught me a lot about construction process and various issues associated with timber construction, I hope to be able to examine other forms of building in the same level of detail. On the other hand by mapping out my experience, I became aware of my limited skills related to legal issues or project management. Obviously, I am hoping to develop these once I go back to work. Yet, in the meantime, I believe that seminars and reading about these subjects areas can help me to go back to practice more prepared. Similarly, I will try to concentrate on a strong CPD programme within my future workplace, as I think I did not emphasised enough in my years out. Most importantly, I hope that in future I will be able to creatively engage in professional work. I think the most important thing that I have learned is the value of creative thinking; I hope to be able to contribute to devising not just interesting design, but also to an innovative business model or to construction method.""","""Architecture Education and Professional Practice""","6614","""Architecture is a field that combines art, science, and technology to create spaces that inspire, support, and enhance the human experience. The education and professional practice of architecture play crucial roles in shaping the built environment and impacting society at large. From the initial stages of learning about design principles to the practical application of those principles in real-world projects, architecture education and professional practice are deeply interconnected and essential components of the architectural profession.  Education in architecture serves as the foundation for aspiring architects to develop the necessary skills, knowledge, and creativity to succeed in the field. Architecture programs typically encompass a diverse range of subjects, including architectural history, theory, technology, structures, sustainability, and design studio courses. These programs aim to instill a comprehensive understanding of the built environment and train students to think critically, solve complex problems, and communicate their ideas effectively.  Design studio courses are at the core of most architecture programs, providing students with hands-on experience in applying design principles to real-world projects. These courses focus on developing creativity, spatial awareness, technical skills, and design process management. Through studio projects, students learn how to conceptualize, develop, and present their design ideas while receiving feedback from instructors and peers to refine their designs further.  Apart from design studios, courses in architectural history and theory are instrumental in providing students with a holistic understanding of the context in which architectural expression occurs. By studying the evolution of architecture, students gain insights into various design movements, cultural influences, and historical precedents that shape contemporary architectural practice. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of architecture enriches students' design sensibilities and encourages them to critically reflect on their work in a broader cultural and historical context.  Technology and sustainability courses are also integral parts of architecture education, as they equip students with the knowledge and skills to leverage cutting-edge tools and practices in designing environmentally responsible buildings. With advancements in building materials, construction techniques, and digital tools, architects are now better positioned to create sustainable and resilient structures that minimize environmental impact and optimize energy efficiency. Courses in building technology and sustainable design principles enable students to integrate these considerations into their design process from the outset.  Structures courses delve into the engineering principles behind building construction, helping architects understand how buildings withstand various loads, forces, and environmental conditions. A solid understanding of structural systems is essential for architects to design safe, functional, and aesthetically pleasing buildings that meet building codes and regulatory requirements. By learning about different structural systems and materials, students can make informed design decisions that prioritize both structural integrity and architectural expression.  In addition to academic coursework, architecture education often includes opportunities for practical training through internships or co-op programs. These experiences expose students to the day-to-day operations of architectural firms, allowing them to apply their classroom knowledge in a professional setting. Internships provide valuable insights into the collaborative nature of architectural practice, the client-architect relationship, project management, and the integration of design with construction processes.  As students progress through their architecture education, they often have the opportunity to work on design competitions, research projects, and community engagement initiatives that enrich their learning experience and broaden their perspectives on the role of architects in society. Engaging in extracurricular activities and interdisciplinary collaborations can help students develop a well-rounded skill set and foster a sense of social responsibility in their design practice.  Upon completing their education, aspiring architects typically pursue licensure to practice professionally. Licensure requirements vary by jurisdiction but generally include a combination of education, experience, and examination components. Most jurisdictions require candidates to hold a professional degree in architecture from an accredited program, complete a period of supervised work experience under a licensed architect, and pass the Architect Registration Examination (ARE) administered by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB).  Obtaining a license is a significant milestone in an architect's career, as it signifies that the individual has met the rigorous standards of professional competence and ethical conduct set forth by regulatory bodies. Licensure enables architects to legally practice architecture, take on independent design projects, and stamp drawings for permitting and construction. Maintaining licensure often involves fulfilling continuing education requirements to stay abreast of advancements in the field and uphold standards of professional practice.  Professional practice in architecture encompasses a broad spectrum of activities, ranging from designing new buildings and renovating existing structures to providing consulting services, project management, and sustainable design solutions. Architects collaborate with clients, engineers, contractors, and other stakeholders to translate design concepts into built reality while navigating regulatory approvals, budget constraints, and project timelines.  Designing a building involves a series of iterative steps, starting from the initial client consultation and site analysis to schematic design, design development, construction documentation, and construction administration. Architects must balance artistic vision with technical proficiency to create innovative and functional spaces that meet the needs and aspirations of their clients while adhering to budgetary and regulatory constraints.  Project management is another critical aspect of professional practice, requiring architects to oversee multiple tasks simultaneously, coordinate with various consultants, and ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. Effective project management involves clear communication, meticulous planning, and the ability to resolve conflicts and challenges that may arise during the design and construction process.  Sustainability has become an increasingly important consideration in architectural practice, with architects seeking to design buildings that are energy-efficient, environmentally responsible, and socially equitable. Integrating sustainable design strategies such as passive solar design, natural ventilation, green roofs, and renewable materials can help minimize the environmental impact of buildings and promote occupant health and well-being.  In addition to design and project management, architects often engage in research and advocacy to advance the profession and address pressing societal issues. Research initiatives may focus on exploring new materials, construction techniques, or design methodologies that push the boundaries of architectural innovation. Advocacy efforts may involve promoting policies that support sustainable design practices, affordable housing solutions, and inclusive urban development.  Collaboration is a key aspect of professional practice in architecture, as architects frequently work in multidisciplinary teams to deliver complex projects that require diverse expertise. Collaborating with engineers, landscape architects, interior designers, and other professionals enriches the design process by incorporating a variety of perspectives and skills that enhance the overall quality of the built environment.  Continuing education is vital for architects to stay current with evolving trends, technologies, and regulations that impact the practice of architecture. Professional development opportunities such as workshops, seminars, conferences, and certifications enable architects to expand their knowledge base, refine their skills, and stay competitive in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry.  Architecture education and professional practice are intrinsically linked, with each informing and enriching the other to cultivate well-rounded architects who are equipped to address the challenges of contemporary society. By fostering a balance of creativity, technical expertise, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility, architecture education prepares professionals to design buildings that not only serve functional needs but also inspire, delight, and endure for generations to come. The journey from architectural education to professional practice is a fulfilling and rewarding path that offers architects the opportunity to make a lasting impact on the built environment and contribute meaningfully to the fabric of society.""","1411"
"38","""A Midsummer Night's Dream and Plato's Republic present dramatically differing views on the nature of truth. Plato's conception of truth runs in line with his metaphysics of The Theory of Forms, in which the objects of the sensory world we inhabit are mere shadows of their ideal form in the absolute realm. He sees poetry as a third degree copy of this absolute truth and so as an obstacle to enlightenment, and ultimately he denies it entry into the ideal state. In contrast to this essentialistic view, A Midsummer Night's Dream offers a more fluid definition of truth. Shakespeare attaches great significance to 'artificial theatricality' which acts as a metaphor for the eternally thwarted search for truth. Set out in the play is the Renaissance Neo Platonic commonplace of 'Harmonia est Discordia Concours', in which the world's creative force is set out in the union of apparent opposites, love and strife etc and without this union, the world would not exist. In the play, this conflict is developed into a discourse which touches upon both the nature of truth itself and the relationship between dramatic structure and the expression of truth. The rigidity of Aristotelian conception of drama is seen as restrictive of a play's ability to express identity which is shown as shifting and elusive. It is telling that the world turned upside down by the chaos of the night's events is the 'court of Athens'. The vigorous force of life with all of its contradictions and vagaries is posed against the equilibrium of the grave seen both in rigid dramatic structure and absolute views of truth. Plato's Republic emphasises the limitation of this gulf between poetry and reality. Poetic mimesis for him is only able to offer a nd order copy of the ideal form and so is a threat to the search for truth. In the Greek aristocratic educational system, HomerThe difference between a poetic character and the poet himself disturbs Plato profoundly. He realises that this entails that identity is susceptible to impersonation and so is not fixed. In mimesis, there is no way of subjecting a poetic character to scientific verification, its truth is unavailable to an external obsever and thus the search for truth. This concern with the implications mimesis has for the search for truth stems from Plato's hierarchical conception of society. In his ideal state, roles were distributed so that each person had only one task, a hierarchy which flowed down from the philosopher King at the top through the ranks of statespeople and artisans down to labourers. The actor, for him violates this unity due to their ability to don different masks and identities, dressing one moment as a king and the next as a beggar, violating this structure. Plato also objects in book III of the Republic to poetry's ability to stir up people's emotions distracting them from what is good and true. This stimulation of the emotions also represents the undermining of personal autonomy; poetry is a dangerous force which takes our sentiments prisoner. This concept of lack of autonomy is suggestive of Plato's fear that poetic artifice is able to subvert essentialist views on identity and ultimately of a fixed conception of truth. He suggests that a 'proper education' will enable someone to see when something is inelegant and will be offended by it. Poetry's value in using harmony, language and rhythm well all depend on its depiction of good charcters, in contrast to Shakespeare's association of the 'lunatic, the lover and the poet'. The poet is impelled, Plato believes to imbue his characters with 'grace, elegance' and goodness. Attacking many of the characters of the Odessey, he asserts that poetry must only show honourable qualities in its characters, depictions of 'luxuriosness' and dishonesty will have a bad influence on his audience. Notably, with reference to Shakespeare, poetry depicting eminent people laughing is also not permitted by Plato, perhaps due to laughter's ability to subvert order and hierarchy. He suggests that a work of art's beauty lies in its being loveable. However, excessive pleasure is incompatible with other virtues. Authentic love of knowledge is disciplined love of things that are restrained and attractive, thus poetry's ability to produce emotions in people is detrimental to the search for truth. Plato's most probing attack on poetry comes in Book X of the republic. He argues that the divine created the ideal forms of everything on earth. Artisans are able to produce a first order copy as they produce something ressembling the form in type. Poets however, are mere representors of others' creations. Theit work is two generations from reality or truth. For him they do not represent things as how they truly are but only how they appear. The poet's understanding of reality is nothing but artifice. If a poet was capable of producing both originals and representation, they would only produce originals so for him they are inferior in skill to the artisan in terms of adherance to truth. They have no actual knowledge of truth, only representative skill. Again referring to Homer, Plato suggests that whilst he is held up as an authority on war, politics, tactics, law etc in Greek education there are no communities which claim him as a reformer of their legal system. Homer did not have hoards of followers and his pupil, Creophylus disreguarded him. This suggests to Plato that Homer had no educational skill or ability to instruct so therefore his poetry is not conducive to enlightenment. Plato also accuses poets of appealing to what the ignorant masses want to hear rather than what is true. He believes that the human mind has the tendency for confusion, such as thinking a stick is bent in water etc. For him, 'illusory art' targets this affliction. The way of addressing this affiction for Plato is reason and what woud now be called empirical observation, measuring etc. Plato asserts, therefore that the 'best' part of a person's psyche is reason, thus poetry addresses the part of the mind which is inferior. The calm reasonable side of the mind is less popular with theatre audiences who cannot understand it. Thus, the poet's creations fall short of truth by appealing to the petulant emotional side of the mind and destroy the rational side by allowing the other to dominate. This for him is the equivalent of destroying a civilised society and allowing the ruffians to rule. If the muse of epic poetry were allowed to rule his ideal state, in place of rule and reason, pleasure and pain would rule. The action of A Midsummer Night's Dream, in contrast, is made intricate by the use of various levels of analogy, making more complex the concept of truth in poetry. The different groups of characters appear to be from different genres, suggesting a hierarchy of poetic reality, with the cosmic wisdom of the realm of the fairies at the top. Theseus and Hippolyta ressemble characters of the epic tradition whose relationship had emerged from the chaos of war to the concord of marriage; Theseus 'wooed' Hippolyta with his sword but he will 'wed thee in another key'. The metaphor of musical 'key' used to evoke their newly found harmony. The lovers, Hermia, Lysander, Helena and Demitrius in contrast, seem more like characters of the Greek Romances of writers such as Xenophon. Finally at the base level of experience we have 'Bottom' and the mechanicals who function on the level of farce. Despite Peter Quince's best efforts to direct the proceedings, Bottom shatters the harmony with his desire to play every part, 'And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too'. He is unwilling to be content in his place or accept the constraints of the dramatic structure of the play within a play. This produces numerous layers of mimetic alteration, and hints at the ability of theatre to question essentialist notions of a fixed human identity. The levels of experience presented in the play challenge Plato's of one objective truth as each set of characters' world is equally real with none offering us the final view on the matter. This suggests that poetry has the ability to produce a multiplicity of realities through use of language itself. Also significant to an exploration of truth in the play is the role of imagination seen in one of Theseus' speech. Though sceptical of the value of poets, Theseus' criticism is not forceful. He has sympathy with the young lovers whom he views as 'fortunately met'. Imagination for him 'bodies forth the forms of things unknown', the use of the word 'forms having heightened significance with reference to Plato. However, the poet's pen is able to 'turn them to shapes' and 'give to airy nothing/ A local habitation and a name'. The imagination creates a discord of shapes which the poet is able to reconcile and give identity to. For Hippolyta, the story of the night's revelries adds up to more, growing 'to something of great contstancy/But howsoever, strange and admirable'. This implies that poetic creation creates a reality in itself with its own internal logic. The play may then be seen as concerning poetry and its role in the discovery of truth. The best creations of poetry are described as being 'but shadows' whilst 'the worst are no worse if imagination amend them'. This use of the metaphor of shadows could be seen as a reference to Plato's cave although it appears that Shakespeare is cunningly suggesting that ultimately the shadows are the only thing available to human investigation. Theseus emphasises the power as well as the limitations of art and imagination. Another important element in the play's exploration of truth is the mechanicals' play within a play, which is for Schlegel 'an acute commentary on the nature of dramatic illusion' (qtd in Leon Guilhamet). The humorous deaths of Pyramus and Thisbe counters the effects of more serious threats in the play which could have culminated to produce a tragedy had Shakespeare's intentions been different. The play within a play could be seen as a parody of contemporary tragedy with its high born characters and attempts to conform to classical form. Instead however, the emotions of tragedy are banished from the play through ridicule. In opposition to the stillness and concord of death we have the discord of human experience and laughter. Shakespeare implies that life itself is inherantly contradictory and incomplete as humans are fragile non-absolute creatures but that this state of ignorance is something to be celebrated rather than struggled against. The reference to death seen within the mechanicals' play could also be a further challenge to Platonic metaphysics. Plato believed that in death, a person's immortal soul travelled to the realm of forms in which it gained absolute knowledge. In countering the sombre tone of tragedy with laughter, Shakespeare asserts the superiority of incomplete human existence over Platonic reverence to death and the subsequent Classical love of tragedy. The play's use of dreams also serves an important function its exploration of truth. All characters share in a transcendent dream in which they cannot distinguish between waking and sleeping. Like dreams plays can be seen as having a surface level, behind which lurks their latent meaning. Demetrius questions 'Are you sure/That we are awake?/It seems to me/That yet we sleep, we dream'. The irony of this phenomenon in the play is that there are very few actual dreams, the characters rather reject the validity of the sensory experience through attributing it to dreams. This skepticism is reflective of the views of another Renaissance figure, Descartes' and his project of doubt, an attempt to find truth. However, his groundbreaking discovery was that there is no answer to a skeptical challenge as to the existence of the external world. All Descartes' thinker can be certain of is his own existence, shifting the focus of truth from Classical absolutism to the human centred Renaissance view. This therefore gives the poet's reality more validity as they create through the centre of their own thoughts, the only thing which cannot be doubted. This link between dreams and truth is further displayed in Bottom's dream of which it is 'past the wit of man to say what dream it was'. The dream is reminiscent of St.Paul's promise, as Bottom recounts comically 'That eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen'. The profundity of Bottom's dream echoes the wisdom of divine order of St.Paul's original, suggesting that the suspension of the waking reality in dreams provides a link to higher knowledge. Shakespeare however puts this widom not in a high born character but in the mouth of his fool, further undermining Classical rigidity. Just as Bottom's dream is an inadequate representation of Paul's promise, so the imaginative conception of the play as a whole is an inadequate mirroring of divine order. However, Shakespeare implies that this parabolic representation is as close as humankind can get to truth, which is ultimately out of reach. This eternal struggle is wryly mocked, 'What fools these mortals be'. In conclusion, The Republic and A Midsummer Night's Dream present radically differing conceptions of truth. The former offers a truth which is out there in objective reality to be discovered, a truth that is unchanging and independent of human perception. Poetry is detrimental to the discovery of this truth as it subverts the constancy of human identity, stirs up the emotions undermining personal autonomy, and is able only to offer a second order copy of the absolute form. The latter, however, presents us with a truth that shifts from one person's perspective to another's. It is ambiguous whether Shakespeare actually believes in an objective truth but he certainly suggests that acquisition of such knowledge is beyond mortal grasp. Celebrated instead we find the full vigour of human life with all of its incompleteness and contradictions pulling against each other. At the close of Book X Plato observes that if poetry was to answer his criticisms in poetic form he would have no answer, the fact that his Dialogues themselves involve mimesis offers a telling fulfillment of this.""","""Nature of truth in literature.""","2834","""In the realm of literature, the nature of truth is a complex and multifaceted concept that transcends mere facts or empirical evidence. Truth in literature goes beyond the realm of objective reality; it delves into the realms of human experience, emotion, and perception. Authors use their unique voices, perspectives, and narratives to explore various truths about the world, human nature, and existence itself. Through the power of storytelling, literature delves into the intangible aspects of truth, offering insights, interpretations, and reflections that can resonate deeply with readers across cultures and generations.  Literature has the remarkable ability to convey truths that may not be easily articulated in other forms of communication. Through the artful use of language, symbolism, metaphor, and imagery, writers can capture the nuances and complexities of human emotions, relationships, and dilemmas. The truth in literature often lies in the subtle nuances, underlying themes, and intricate layers that invite readers to explore, interpret, and contemplate the deeper meanings embedded within the text.  At the heart of the nature of truth in literature lies the concept of subjective truth. Unlike scientific or mathematical truths that are based on objective evidence and logic, truths in literature are often subjective, open to interpretation, and influenced by personal experiences and beliefs. What may ring true for one reader may not hold the same resonance for another, highlighting the fluid and dynamic nature of truth in literature.  Literature serves as a mirror that reflects the complexities of the human experience, inviting readers to confront uncomfortable truths, challenging their perceptions, and expanding their understanding of the world. Through literature, authors can offer profound insights into human nature, societal issues, and philosophical inquiries that transcend time and place. The truths presented in literature are not always comfortable or reassuring; they can be disruptive, provocative, and challenging, forcing readers to confront their assumptions, biases, and preconceptions.  One of the most powerful aspects of truth in literature is its ability to evoke empathy and compassion in readers. By immersing themselves in the lives, thoughts, and emotions of characters, readers can experience diverse perspectives, cultures, and worldviews, fostering a greater understanding of the complexities of the human condition. Literature has the capacity to bridge cultural divides, foster dialogue, and cultivate empathy by showcasing the universal truths that connect individuals across different backgrounds and experiences.  Another essential aspect of the nature of truth in literature is the concept of authenticity. Authenticity in literature refers to the genuine expression of the author's voice, experiences, and emotions in their writing. Readers are drawn to authentic narratives that resonate with truthfulness, sincerity, and emotional depth. Authenticity in literature allows readers to connect with the text on a profound level, forging an intimate bond between the author and the audience.  Literature also grapples with the notion of universal truths—ideas, emotions, and experiences that resonate with all human beings regardless of cultural or historical context. By tapping into shared themes such as love, loss, identity, and morality, literature can transcend barriers of time and space, creating a timeless resonance that speaks to the core of the human experience. Through the exploration of universal truths, literature can inspire readers to reflect on their own lives, beliefs, and values, fostering a sense of common humanity and interconnectedness.  Metaphor and symbolism play a crucial role in conveying truths in literature. Authors often use metaphors and symbols to imbue their writing with deeper meanings and layers of interpretation. Metaphors can illuminate complex ideas, emotions, or concepts by drawing parallels with familiar objects or phenomena, inviting readers to delve beneath the surface of the text to uncover hidden truths. Symbols, on the other hand, can represent abstract ideas, themes, or values, adding richness and texture to the narrative and offering readers a gateway to explore the underlying truths embedded within the text.  The nature of truth in literature is also closely intertwined with the concept of narrative perspective. The choice of narrative perspective—whether first-person, third-person, omniscient, or unreliable narrator—shapes the way truth is presented and perceived in a literary work. Each narrative perspective offers a distinct vantage point through which readers can access the truths, biases, and motivations of the characters and the world they inhabit. By manipulating narrative perspective, authors can challenge readers' perceptions, subvert expectations, and blur the line between reality and fiction, complicating the notion of truth in literature.  Literature has the power to challenge conventional notions of truth and reality by pushing the boundaries of storytelling, language, and imagination. Authors often employ techniques such as magical realism, surrealism, or metafiction to disrupt linear narratives and conventional truths, inviting readers to question their assumptions and engage with the text on a deeper level. By defying expectations and embracing ambiguity, literature can create spaces for exploration, interpretation, and contemplation that transcend traditional notions of truth and meaning.  The nature of truth in literature is a dynamic and evolving concept that continues to be a source of fascination and inquiry for readers, writers, and scholars alike. Through its ability to capture the complexities of the human experience, literature offers a unique lens through which truths can be explored, questioned, and reimagined. Whether through timeless classics, contemporary novels, or experimental works, literature continues to push the boundaries of storytelling, language, and representation, inviting readers to embark on a journey of discovery, introspection, and transformation.  In conclusion, the nature of truth in literature is a rich and intricate tapestry woven from the threads of human experience, emotion, and imagination. Through the power of storytelling, language, and symbolism, literature explores diverse truths about the world, human nature, and existence, offering readers profound insights, reflections, and interpretations that resonate across cultures and generations. By engaging with the complexities of subjective truth, authenticity, universal themes, metaphor, symbolism, narrative perspective, and narrative experimentation, literature challenges readers to confront uncomfortable truths, expand their understanding of the human condition, and nurture empathy and compassion. The nature of truth in literature is a testament to the enduring power of storytelling to illuminate, provoke, and inspire, inviting audiences to explore the depths of truth and meaning embedded within the vast and wondrous world of literature.""","1233"
"6054","""In accordance with the title I am allowing Medea to be a figure of male nightmares and intend to argue the reasons why she both is, and is not, something more than that. I believe that, viewed as just a character in a tragedy, Medea is nothing more than figure of male nightmares. She has few of the qualities that we are led to believe Athenian women of her time had. She is not submissive or obedient to men, and she does not remain in the house to take care of its management and her children. Infact she is almost male. She is the aggressor, she takes the initiative and she exacts her revenge in a male way, through death. From the weeping, desolate woman at the beginning of the play grows an enraged monster who, by the end, rides away in a chariot of the gods with the blood of her own children on her hands. She becomes so outrageous, so huge and terrifying a monster, that she cannot be more than a nightmare because such a creature could only ever exist in dreams. However, when viewed as a piece of work, a literary creation, Medea is much more than just a nightmare. She is a statement on the roles and treatment of women in Athens in the th Century and a literary advancement in characterisation on the part of Euripides. Medea cannot be anything more than a figure of male nightmares as a character because she is too unrealistic and extreme to exist outside the dreamscape. First and foremost she is a monster. She sacrifices her own children just to get back at Jason, and even does so after she knows she has successfully killed his wife and father-in-law. She cannot be content until she sees him done as much damage as possible and no obstacle, not even her own flesh and blood, will stand in her way. That is what makes her 'No woman, but a tiger; a Tuscan Scylla- but more savage'. This extent of preoccupation with bloodshed and revenge belongs to no one else but the Furies. Nowhere else in Greek tragedy do we see such supposedly reasoned savagery. As the play goes on we watch as Medea's humanity falls away. At the beginning she weeps in the house and laments the loss of Jason. However, it is not long before she is cursing him and planning her revenge. When she asks the messenger from the palace to recount the deaths of the princess and her father she states: 'You'll give me double pleasure if their death was horrible.'. She then ignores the part of her that urges her not to kill her children, effectively shutting off the last of her humanity as, when she appears at the end of the play, triumphant and elite, she shows little remorse and reminds Jason angrily 'I can stab too:'. She may be a barbarian, and thus not expected to behave in a civilised way, but, as Knox points out, in Iphigenia in Tauris the captured barbarian king says about Orestes murder of his own mother: 'Not even among the barbarians would anyone have the heart to do what he has done.'. Here is Euripides himself pointing out that even the barbarians, these savage outsiders, would not commit such a crime against their own blood. Euripides, Medea, Vellacott translation, p.8, l.344 B. Knox, 'Medea of Euripides', Word and Action: Essays on the Ancient Theater, p.10 Another aspect of Medea that makes her so extreme and unbelievable is her maleness. No woman of Athens would ever be so male, so she becomes even more improbable and dream-like. She states how she would rather '.stand three times in the front line than bear one child.', preferring fighting like a man to giving birth to children like a woman. Medea's great anger also suggests a maleness as public anger belonged very much to the male in Athens at the time. As Harris says: 'A properly organised city, from a Greek male point of view, was one in which women knew their place; and knowing their place involved among other thing avoiding anger.'. Medea does know her 'place', that of a grateful foreigner, and obedient inhabitant, but not a citizen, of Athens, but she refuses to be put in it. She lets loose her anger as if she were male and has the right to and she takes her revenge as if she were male, by killing. 'I understand the horror of what I am going to do; but anger, the spring of all life's horror, masters my resolve.' W.V. Harris, 'The rage of women', Ancient Anger, p.37 Euripides, Medea, Vellacott translation, p.0, l. 079-1 Another thing that makes Medea so unbelievable is the way she appears to have the Gods behind her. The Gods did not look kindly on those who killed their own family and punished them, yet Medea calls on Zeus many times throughout the play and there is never any evidence of him taking action against her. In Oedipus Rex the gods make their displeasure at Oedipus' pollution known by causing a famine and barrenness on his city. In Aeschylus' Agamemnon the constant references to the Furies let us know that Clytemnestra's deeds will not go unpunished. However in Medea, at the end of the play we see only a sign of support from the Gods: the chariot of Helios. As a literary creation, Medea is much more than a nightmare. In her Euripides creates a more advanced heroine than has been seen before. She seems part Sophoclean hero, she is set on what she is going to do, she is passionate, she will not listen to reason, she is alone, she feels disrespected, she is unafraid of consequences and so on. In these ways, she resembles Sophocles' Electra from the play of the same title thought to have been written around or just before Medea. But she is not all Electra, as Electra cannot act without Orestes and Medea, though she needs Aegeus' aid for the future, does not need a male hand to do her killing. In this respect she is like Aeschylus' Clytemnestra from the century before, another committer of murder within the family. Like Clytemnestra she is cunning and willing to spend time deceiving her enemies so as to set up the perfect revenge. Like Clytemnestra she will do the deed herself, and like Clytemnestra she does not object to killing the innocent party of whom they both seem jealous (in Medea's case Glacue, and in Clytemnestra's Cassandra). But to both these characters Euripides must add something more to create the product that is Medea: an element of monstrosity. Clytemnestra may be cruel like Medea, but she goes straight to the heart of matters and kills Agamemnon. Medea does not kill Jason, she does what is possibly worse, she decides to revenge herself by hurting him as much as she possibly can, 'This is the way to deal Jason the deepest wound.'. She is unlike any heroines that have gone before her, designed to shock, and she still does now, thousands of years on. She is much more than a nightmare in this respect, she is a masterpiece. B. Knox, 'Medea of Euripides', Word and Action: Essays on the Ancient Theater, p.98 Euripides, Medea, Vellacott translation, p.3, l.5/86 Medea is also more than a nightmare in another sense. She is a statement on Athenian women of the time. Out of her mouth comes some of the most pro-women statements of her time. It is because of her speeches that many label Euripides a feminist. As Goldhill, rephrasing Slater, puts it: 'Women, repressed in life by men, find a voice through men in the institution of tragedy.' and in Medea Euripides seems to do just that. 'Surely, of all creatures that have life and will. We women are the most wretched.' Medea moans, but as she carries on we see the role of women unfolding. She talks of being possessed by one's husband, of having to 'purchase' this husband at a price and she makes valid points about what little a woman has should her husband leave her. It is very hard not to sympathise with Medea throughout the first few scenes of the play, and even though that sympathy may diminish as she takes her revenge, her points are still no less valid. She has been betrayed, Jason is indeed an 'oath-breaker' and a 'guest-deceiver'. The chorus, a group of Greek women, agree with her 'To punish Jason will be just.'. And although the tragedies are plays and are thus not necessarily a completely accurate representation of Greek society at the time, they cannot be discounted completely. As Goldhill suggests after comparing Sophocles' Procne to Medea: 'The attribution if such sentiments to two such similar characters by two different playwrights suggests that the lot of women was, in late fifth-century Athens, very much a question of the day, and also a subject that fascinated the tragic poets.'. S. Goldhill, Reading Greek Tragedy, p.13 Euripides, Medea, Vellacott translation, p.7, l.03 S. Goldhill, Reading Greek Tragedy, p.13 In conclusion, Medea can be seen as both nothing more than a male nightmare and as something much greater than just that. She can be dismissed as being nothing more than a fantastical, evil witch, or she can be viewed as thrilling advancement and a thought-provoking message on the functions and expectations of Athenian women of the fifth-century.""","""Medea: Female Power and Nightmare""","2057","""Medea: Female Power and Nightmare  Medea, a figure from ancient Greek mythology, is one of the most complex and controversial characters in literary history. Renowned for her intellect, passion, and ruthless determination, Medea subverts traditional gender roles and embodies the complexities of female power. The story of Medea, as depicted in Euripides' play """"Medea,"""" explores themes of love, betrayal, revenge, and the darker aspects of human nature. This tragic tale delves into the depths of the human psyche, questioning the limits of power, the consequences of unchecked emotions, and the complexities of being a woman in a patriarchal society.  At the heart of the Medea myth is the character herself - a powerful sorceress and a woman scorned. Medea is depicted as a foreigner, a princess from Colchis, who uses her intelligence and cunning to aid Jason in his quest for the Golden Fleece. Despite her pivotal role in Jason's success, Medea is ultimately betrayed when Jason abandons her for a younger and more politically advantageous marriage. This act of betrayal sets in motion a chain of events that highlights Medea's agency, resourcefulness, and capacity for extreme violence.  One of the central themes of the Medea myth is the exploration of female power and agency. Medea defies societal expectations of what a woman should be, challenging the traditional roles of wife and mother. Instead of passively accepting her fate, Medea takes matters into her own hands, displaying agency and autonomy in a male-dominated world. Her actions, though morally questionable, highlight her refusal to be a victim of circumstances. By harnessing her intellect and magical abilities, Medea carves out a path of vengeance that asserts her power over those who have wronged her.  Furthermore, Medea's character embodies the complexities of female emotions, particularly the destructive power of unchecked passion and rage. Her intense love for Jason turns to bitter hatred when he betrays her, leading her to commit unspeakable acts of violence. Medea's emotions drive her actions, blurring the lines between love and hate, devotion and revenge. Through her character, Euripides explores the volatile nature of human emotions, especially when fueled by betrayal and heartbreak.  The concept of female power in the context of Medea is further complicated by her status as a foreigner and a woman in a patriarchal society. Medea's outsider status sets her apart from the Greek women of Corinth, making her both intriguing and threatening to those around her. Her status as a powerful sorceress further accentuates her otherness, challenging conventional norms of femininity and submission. In a society where women were expected to be obedient and passive, Medea's defiance and agency are radical and unsettling.  The character of Medea also raises questions about the intersection of motherhood and power. Despite her horrific actions, Medea's love for her children is evident throughout the play. Her decision to kill her sons is a twisted act of revenge, driven by a desire to hurt Jason in the most profound way possible. This tragic act underscores the depths of Medea's despair and the lengths to which she is willing to go to avenge her pride and reclaim her power. The portrayal of a mother who commits filicide challenges traditional notions of maternal love and duty, presenting a complex and unsettling image of female power.  In addition to her portrayal as a powerful and vengeful figure, Medea is also depicted as a symbol of the destructive forces unleashed by unbridled rage and jealousy. Her actions are driven by a potent mix of emotions that consume her from within, leading her to commit acts of violence that shock and horrify those around her. Medea's descent into madness serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of allowing negative emotions to overpower reason and morality. Her story serves as a stark reminder of the destructive potential of unchecked passion and the devastating consequences of seeking vengeance at any cost.  The enduring fascination with the character of Medea lies in her ability to transcend the confines of traditional gender roles and embody a complex and multifaceted representation of female power. She challenges societal expectations of women, defying easy categorization as either a victim or a villain. Medea's story forces audiences to confront uncomfortable truths about power, agency, and the consequences of marginalizing those who do not conform to societal norms. By subverting expectations and embracing her own brand of power, Medea remains a compelling and enigmatic figure whose legacy continues to resonate through the ages.  In conclusion, Medea represents a potent blend of female power and nightmare, embodying the complexities of agency, emotion, and societal expectations. Her character serves as a powerful reminder of the dangers of unchecked passion and the destructive potential of revenge. By delving into the darker aspects of human nature, the story of Medea challenges audiences to grapple with the complexities of power dynamics, gender roles, and the consequences of betrayal. Through her defiance and ruthless determination, Medea transcends the limitations imposed by society, leaving a lasting impact on those who encounter her story.""","1024"
"58","""The Bertrand and Cournot competition models both relate to an oligopoly. An oligopoly is a market with relatively few firms but many buyers. It is characterised by each firm recognising their mutual interdependence and therefore acting strategically as well as the fact that the goods sold within the market are usually close substitutes. Under the Cournot model firms behave strategically with respect to the quantity of the good produced whereas under the Bertrand Model the firms compete through prices. When comparing the intensity of Bertrand competition with Cournot competition it is vital to be clear about the meaning of intensity. The most common meaning in this context is how close to perfect competition each model is. The closer to perfect competition, the more intense the competition is. Another way of looking at this is how much tolerance the market gives to inefficient firms. The lower the tolerance to inefficient firms the more intense the competition. Using this definition the Bertrand model, assuming homogeneous goods, can be seen to have significantly more intense competition. Under differentiated products the competition can still be seen to be more intense under Bertrand, however, the Cournot and Bertrand models move much closer together and the difference is not as stark. In addition, there are other ways of measuring competition intensity such as the level of a discount factor required for mutual collusion in an infinitely repeated Bertrand or Cournot game as well as the degree of advertising in each type of market. It is interesting to compare the Cournot and Bertrand models in these circumstances. Mutual Interdependence means that the price or output choices made by any one firm in the market affect the profits of all the firms in the market. Two goods that are substitutes satisfy similar wants. An increase in the price of one good leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of a is essential when comparing the Cournot and Bertrand models to first look at their construction. For ease and graphical purposes it is sufficient to consider a duopoly. We also assume linear well products that are perfect the Cournot Model each firm wishes to maximise respect to their own output with the assumption that other firms' output is given. Profit of Firm: First Order maximising condition: Therefore, we can solve for Firm: Due to identical products: Hence, we now have the two best reaction functions for both firm and firm which can be shown goods are complements if they tend to be used together. An increase in the price of good leads to an decrease in the quantity demanded of a assume that firm 's price is and that firm 's price is where d is the measure of differentiability within the market. If then the goods are imperfect substitutes whereas if then the goods are complements. If then the goods are independent, at the good are perfect complements and at the goods are perfect substitutes. Within most oligopolies it would be reasonable to assume that good are usually imperfect or perfect substitutes, hence it is possible to focus solely on. Using the same method as previously it is possible to calculate the reaction functions for the Cournot model under differentiated products and demonstrate these by d obtain.. Hence R2R1 Figure: Best reaction functions for the Cournot mode obtain the present value of future profits. In addition, we assume homogenous products for simplicity. The infinitely repeated game in both cases can be modelled as a Prisoner's Dilemma game. Under Bertrand competition, collusion is both firms charging the monopoly price and sharing the monopoly profit. Mutual cheating is the unique Nash Equilibrium of the 'one shot' game where each firm charges price equal to marginal cost and therefore has zero profits. If one firm cheats whilst the other colludes it would charge slightly under the monopoly price and capture the whole market so obtaining the monopoly profit. Strategy within the infinitely repeated game can be modelled as a Grim Trigger Strategy. Firms collude if the other players have a history of colluding otherwise they cheat forever. Firms will collude as long as the present value of profits from colluding are greater than the present value of profits from cheating, known as tacit collusion. Therefore collusion will occur if which happens when the discount rate is greater than a half. Under Cournot competition, mutual collusion is again the shared monopoly profit and mutual cheating is the Cournot profit obtained from the 'one shot' game. If one firm colludes and the other cheats then the cheating firm maximises profit assuming that the colluding firm produces half the monopoly amount. The output level can be obtained using the best reaction function. Again Grim Trigger Strategies are assumed. Therefore, similarly, it is possible to calculate that under infinitely repeated Cournot competition, collusion will occur when the discount rate is greater than. In the case of infinitely repeated games perhaps we can measure intensity of competition by the likelihood a firm will cheat rather than collude. Under Cournot competition the discount factor needed for mutual collusion is higher than that under Bertrand competition. It takes less for firms to collude under Bertrand than under Cournot competition perhaps therefore meaning that the infinitely repeated game competition is more intense under Cournot than Bertrand competition. Advertising can demonstrate how intense the competition in a market is as it is a tool 'to increase sales by expanding total market and attracting customers from competitors' (Nicholson, 972, p202). When measuring intensity of competition in this way Bertrand competition is not necessarily more intense than Cournot competition. A market could appear to follow a less intense Cournot model in that it is comparatively passive with regard to pricing policies but could compete rigorously with regard to advertising policies. For example, the car market could be seen to follow a Cournot model as price can be more easily adjusted than production. Quantity is the dominant strategic variable. However, advertising is fierce for instance on both television and radio. This can be compared to the mail order catalogue market which should operate under the Bertrand model as price is the dominant strategic variable. However, in this market advertising is not as strong as within the car market. It is, therefore, perhaps possible for Cournot competition to be more intense than Bertrand competition when measured in this way. There is much microeconomic theory to support Bertrand competition being more 'intense' than Cournot competition. Under homogeneous products this difference in intensity is stark with Bertrand competition representing a model of perfect competition where inefficient firms simply cannot survive. However, the difference in intensity becomes much less clear when a market for differentiated products is considered. Here the predictions of the models are much closer together and whilst Bertrand still appears to demonstrate the most intense competition, the difference between the two models is certainly not as transparent. We can also look perhaps at different types of competition measures such as the discount factor required for collusion within infinitely repeated Cournot and Bertrand competition or advertising intensity. Here it can be seen that a market operating under Bertrand competition is not necessarily more competitive than a market operating under a Cournot model. We must be very careful of our definition of intensity of competition when discussing this topic. We must also remember that the Bertrand and Cournot models are simply the building blocks of oligopoly theory. In order to discuss intensity of competition further, we could perhaps investigate market concentration ratios to discover if the number of firms entering each type of competitive market differs and how this affects intensity of competition.""","""Oligopoly competition models: Bertrand vs. Cournot""","1464","""In the realm of oligopoly competition models, the Bertrand and Cournot models stand out as two prominent frameworks that economists use to analyze and understand how firms interact within an oligopolistic market structure. These models offer valuable insights into pricing strategies, market outcomes, and the dynamics of competition among a limited number of firms. By examining the underlying assumptions, strategies, and outcomes of the Bertrand and Cournot models, we can gain a deeper understanding of how firms in oligopolistic markets behave and compete.  The Cournot model, named after the French economist Augustin Cournot, is based on the assumption that firms set their quantities simultaneously, taking into account their competitors' quantities. In this model, each firm chooses its output level with the aim of maximizing profit, considering the reaction of its rivals. The Cournot equilibrium occurs when each firm's output level is such that no firm has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from its chosen quantity.  One of the key features of the Cournot model is the assumption of quantity competition. Firms compete by choosing the quantities they will produce rather than setting prices directly. By selecting their output levels strategically, firms must consider how their choices will impact market prices and their competitors' responses. This strategic interdependence among firms distinguishes the Cournot model from other competitive models.  In contrast, the Bertrand model, named after the French economist Joseph Bertrand, is based on the assumption that firms set prices rather than quantities. In this model, firms simultaneously choose the prices at which they will sell their products, taking into account their competitors' prices. The Bertrand equilibrium occurs when all firms charge a price equal to their marginal cost, as firms undercut each other to capture market share.  The key feature of the Bertrand model is price competition. Firms compete by adjusting their prices to attract customers, leading to a situation where prices are driven down to marginal cost levels. Unlike in the Cournot model where firms compete on quantities, in the Bertrand model, firms compete directly on price, leading to a """"race to the bottom"""" as firms seek to offer the lowest price in the market.  Comparing the two models, the Cournot model typically results in higher prices and lower quantities than the Bertrand model. This outcome stems from the fact that in the Cournot model, firms compete on quantities, leading to a more moderate level of competition compared to the intense price competition in the Bertrand model. The Bertrand model, on the other hand, often leads to prices being driven down to marginal cost levels due to the direct competition on price.  Both the Cournot and Bertrand models have their strengths and weaknesses in explaining real-world oligopolistic competition. The Cournot model is particularly useful for industries where firms can adjust their production levels relatively quickly and where capacity constraints play a significant role. On the other hand, the Bertrand model is more relevant in industries where firms can easily adjust prices and where products are homogenous.  Moreover, the Cournot model assumes that firms have perfect information about their competitors' costs and market demand, which may not always hold in practice. In contrast, the Bertrand model assumes that firms can adjust prices instantaneously, which may not be realistic in industries with sticky prices or costs.  In terms of market outcomes, the Cournot model often results in higher prices and market shares for firms compared to the Bertrand model. This is because in the Cournot model, firms compete more on quantities, leading to a less aggressive price competition. In contrast, the Bertrand model tends to drive prices down to marginal cost levels, resulting in lower prices and potentially lower profits for firms.  Overall, both the Cournot and Bertrand models provide valuable insights into oligopolistic competition and help economists understand the behavior of firms in such markets. While the Cournot model focuses on quantity competition and strategic interactions among firms, the Bertrand model emphasizes price competition and the impact of pricing strategies on market outcomes.  In conclusion, the Cournot and Bertrand models offer distinct perspectives on how firms compete in oligopolistic markets based on their assumptions about pricing strategies. By studying these models, economists can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of competition among a limited number of firms and how different strategies can impact market outcomes. Ultimately, both models play a crucial role in analyzing oligopoly competition and shedding light on the complexities of firm behavior in such market structures.""","880"
"253","""Sir Guenter Treitel in his textbook defines contract as an 'agreement giving rise to obligations which are enforced or recognised by law. The factor which distinguishes contractual from other legal obligations is that they are based on the agreement of the contracting parties'. The law of contract is therefore, a mutual exchange of requirements, where each party has to do something to make the agreement legally binding. In order for a contract to exist, it is subjected to a number of important formalities. First, there must me an offer and the offer must be accepted. Then, both parties must provide consideration and have an intention to create legal relations. Both parties must also have the capacity to create a contract. Finally, the purpose of the contract must be valid. The law of advising Workwell Ltd on the legal implications of the events stated, we must first understand the concept of tender under the eye of contract law. A tender is competitive offer to provide goods and services. It is held in Spencer v. Harding that tenders are basically a mere attempt to establish whether an offer can be obtained. The general principle is that an invitation to submit tender is not an offer but considered as an invitation to treat. Invitation to treat is merely an invitation to others to make offers to you. Hence, the invitation to tender is not an offer but the production of the tender is the offer, which can be accepted or rejected. If accepted, this is the binding contract. In the case of Workwell Ltd. and the Highroad plc, it is established that Workwell Ltd. is bound by the contract because Highroad plc had invited tenders for the civil engineering project and Workwell Ltd. responded by giving an offer of a quote calculated based on Drainklear's price. Then, the offer was accepted by Highroad plc when they awarded Workwell Ltd. with the Highroad contract. Here, the contract is said to exist and that there is consensus ad idem. However, to be legally binding, acceptance must fulfil three rules. Acceptance therefore must be a 'mirror image' of the offer, firm and communicated to the offerror. These rules are seen to be fulfilled by Highroad plc. Assuming a valid offer and consideration The offeree must agree to all the terms of the offer and not trying to introduce new terms. Furthermore, it is enforceable that there is consideration on both parties in order to have a valid contract. It is ascertained that there was an executory consideration on both parties. Executory consideration is a promise to give consideration in the future. Here, the consideration given by Workwell Ltd. is the promise to carry out the civil engineering job and the consideration given by Highroad plc is the promise to pay. Besides that, based on the general rule of the courts, commercial deal or business agreement intend to create legal relations. It is also highly likely that both Workwell Ltd and Highroad plc to sue each other if either party breaks the agreement since it involves quite a sum of money. Finally, both parties have the capacity to make the contract, that is both parties were not forced into the contract and the contract is further said to be valid because the purpose is legal and not immoral which go against public policy. However, Workwell Ltd may decide to argue that they only submitted a 'quote' which does not constitute an offer. But, in Crowshaw V. Pritchard and that acceptance of offer by post is effective even if letter is delayed in the post or fails to reach the offeror, provided that this is not due to the offeree's fault and that the letter is properly stamped and addressed. Through these decisions, the letter of acceptance by Workwell Ltd. proves to be invalid on the day it was posted as it was wrongly addressed and only reached Drainklear days after Workwell Ltd. received the revocation letter. The letter which Drainklear wrote to Workwell Ltd. explaining that they could not undertake the work for less than 9,00. In Byrne V. Van Tienhoven (880), it was held that postal revocation is ineffective unless it is received by the offeree before the acceptance date. But in this situation, since the letter of acceptance is invalid on the day it was posted, it is considered valid only on the day of receipt and by that time, revocation had been taken place (revocation letter arrived Workwell Ltd. days before the acceptance date). Hence, there is no legal binding contract which undoubtedly gives no allowance for Workwell Ltd. to hold Drainklear at its original price. It was held that a contract was formed on 1th October when the claimant mailed his telegram of acceptance. The revocation was not communicated to the claimant until 0th October and was, therefore, too late to be effective. In conclusion, it is observed that Workwell Ltd. is bound by their bid for the Highroad contract and if Workwell Ltd. decides not to continue with the project for reasons like high cost for instance, Workwell Ltd. is said to be in breach of contract. Workwell Ltd. also may not hold Drainklear to their original price because it is seen that there was no contract and it was not legally binding and that the revocation is allowable before acceptance of contract. Both this situations is likely to give complications to Workwell Ltd. It is suggested that Workwell Ltd. should try and renegotiate the new price quoted by Drainklear so that they could take the job for less than 9,00. Another alternative would be inviting new tenders and stating terms of which include the total price should be about 9,00. However, this may not be an easy process. If renegotiations are not successful, then worse comes to worse is that Workwell Ltd. is likely to suffer the loss of 0,00. If matters are brought to court then Workwell Ltd may end up suffering more than 0,00.""","""Contract Law and Tender Implications""","1202","""Contract Law and Tender Implications play a crucial role in shaping business relationships and transactions. Understanding the legal framework surrounding contracts and tenders is essential for businesses to protect their interests and ensure compliance with legal requirements. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the key aspects of Contract Law and Tender Implications, examining their significance, principles, and practical applications.  Contract Law serves as the foundation for business agreements, outlining the rights and obligations of parties entering into a contract. A contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties that creates rights and obligations enforceable by law. For a contract to be valid, certain essential elements must be present, including an offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations, capacity, and legality of the purpose. These elements form the basis of a valid contract and help prevent disputes and ambiguities during the contractual relationship.  One of the fundamental principles of Contract Law is the principle of freedom of contract, which allows parties to negotiate and determine the terms of their agreement. However, this freedom is subject to statutory and common law limitations to ensure fairness and prevent exploitation. Contracts must be entered into voluntarily, without coercion or undue influence, to be considered valid and enforceable. Additionally, contracts must not be based on illegal activities or against public policy to be legally binding.  Tenders are a formal offer to perform work, supply goods, or buy property at a specified price. Tendering is a common practice in industries such as construction, government procurement, and consulting services. The tender process involves inviting bids from potential suppliers or contractors, evaluating the proposals based on predefined criteria, and selecting the most suitable offer. It is essential for organizations to follow transparent and fair tender procedures to ensure integrity and accountability in the procurement process.  Tender implications refer to the legal consequences of participating in a tender process and submitting a bid. When a party submits a tender, they are making a serious commitment to perform the work or supply the goods as per the terms specified in the tender documents. If the tender is accepted, a legally binding contract is formed between the parties, and they are obligated to fulfill their obligations as per the terms of the contract. Failure to do so can lead to legal consequences such as breach of contract claims, damages, and loss of reputation.  Contract Law and Tender Implications intersect in the context of tender contracts. When participating in a tender process, bidders must carefully review and understand the terms and conditions of the tender documents. These documents typically outline the scope of work, specifications, deliverables, deadlines, payment terms, and dispute resolution mechanisms. By submitting a tender, bidders are deemed to have accepted these terms, and they are legally bound to adhere to them if their bid is accepted.  In the event of a dispute or disagreement during the tender process or after the contract is awarded, Contract Law provides a framework for resolving conflicts. Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as negotiation, mediation, and arbitration are often preferred to resolve disputes efficiently and cost-effectively. However, if the parties are unable to reach a resolution through these methods, litigation through the court system may be necessary to enforce contractual rights and seek remedies for breaches.  It is crucial for businesses engaging in tendering activities to seek legal advice to navigate the complex legal landscape surrounding contracts and tenders. Legal experts can provide guidance on interpreting tender documents, negotiating contractual terms, and enforcing contractual rights in case of disputes. By proactively addressing legal issues related to contracts and tenders, businesses can mitigate risks, protect their interests, and maintain compliance with legal requirements.  In conclusion, understanding Contract Law and Tender Implications is vital for businesses to navigate the complexities of contractual relationships and tender processes. By adhering to legal principles, ensuring transparency in tender procedures, and seeking legal counsel when needed, businesses can effectively manage risks, protect their rights, and foster successful business transactions. Contract Law serves as a cornerstone for enforcing agreements, while tender implications highlight the legal consequences of participating in tender processes. By upholding ethical standards and legal compliance, businesses can build trust, credibility, and long-term partnerships in the competitive marketplace.""","817"
"6107","""This report documents the creation of using a mobile phone to control a buggy's move direction. The whole system can complete a coherent motion: Dial one of these five the phone keyboard, the buggy will move toward the assigned direction or pause. The system couples together the GSM modem, DTMF decoder, PIC microprocessor and stepper motors on the buggy. To achieve the effective communications between them, a series of methods are designed to meet the specification. Such as the AT commands transmission in the forms of ASCII strings between the GSM modem and the PIC, which are implemented by programs. Results indicate that the remote control of a machine is exercisable and reliable. The assigned directions are below:.This project has great practical value in remote control application. There are always some dangerous circumstances that people can not access into for the spot direction or control, such as the lab where is full of harmful radioactive rays. So the need for accurate and real-time remote control is necessary and demanding. Remote and intelligent control is a longtime existed but still prospecting area of interest in current research. My project is an attempt on the remote control to a buggy by a series of communication and processor systems. It can ensure precise and quick direction alter by the instructions you give in faraway distance, which is just by pressing numbers on the digital keyboard of your mobile phone or any fixed telephone. Such an easy function seems to have, it need to go through many parts and links. There are four indispensable elements contained in the buggy, the GSM modem, the DTMF decoder, the PIC microprocessor and the driven boards with their stepper motors, which all act different but related work. To achieve the whole system's successful target requires these parts work smoothly in their section but cooperate well with each other in the entire link. The buggy changing its direction under the command obviously has something to do with its stepper motors inside. By changing the direction of current flowing through the winding, the pole produced by become opposite making the rotor turned. So if you give the according the magnet pole, it is possible to realize the direction change movement. But which direction is ordered by person? This question depends on whether the communication is good enough. The PIC microprocessor will enable the stepper motor's move but it need to get the instruction information from another source, which is DTMF. From the project's title, we learn that DTMF must act an important role in the system. It is true because it decodes the tone information into digital binary forms and sends them to PIC. The tone of the number we pressed, is transmitted through the GSM wireless communication network. To connect with the GSM modem requires dialing its SIM card number first, then wait for its automatically answer by the successful AT commands stream sent by PIC through the series port. When they begin communicating, the tone of number pressed will arrive at the input of the DTMF through the speaker of the modem. Under the condition that those links introduced above work properly, the whole system becomes a corporate one. The final target is achieved through the four parts. There are much more knowledge and details in every part. It is a communication system, while also a programmable and processing system. However, it is used for control from people to machine no matter the distance between them, which stand for the advanced applications in carrying out the human's will and instructions.. Background ResearchResearching into all parts of the system then provide sufficient knowledge before starting of the effective link and proper function. From the knowledge gained the most suitable components were chosen and carried forward to the construction stage. GSM network and GSM modemThe Global System for Mobile the most popular standard for mobile phones in the world. GSM service is used by over. billion people across more than 10 countries and territories. GSM differs significantly from its predecessors in that both signaling and speech channels are digital, which means that it is considered a second phone system. GSM is an open standard which is currently developed by the GPP. GSM is a cellular network, which means that mobile phones connect to it by searching for cells in the immediate vicinity. GSM networks operate at various different radio frequencies. Most GSM networks operate in the 00 MHz or 800 MHz bands. The network behind the GSM system seen by the customer is large and complicated in order to provide all of the services which are required. It is divided into a number of sections and these are each covered in separate articles. the Base Station AT commands. A modem is needed for receiving the call and transmitting instructions through voice tone. Comparing with many GSM modems, the GSM100T of RF solutions company is considered as our optimum decision to undertake the major communication task, since it is capable of meeting the requirements appeared in project. It is a miniature 'Plug And Play' dual band GSM modem. It can be directly connected to the serial port of a desktop or notebook computer or microprocessor through the RS232 interface. A standard SIM card can be inserted in the integral card holder within the metal enclosure. It means that the number in this SIM card is also the 'name' of our buggy. The GSM modems metal casing makes it an appropriate solution for tough applications such as Telemetry, Wireless Local as part of a fleet management system. Its small size makes it simple to integrate in a space constraint environment. The modem is supplied with power cable, other accessories available are an is utilized by the modem and communication software. For example, S7=0 instructs your computer to 'Set register # to the value 0'. Commands may be entered from the terminal mode of most communications software packages. We use Hyper-terminal as the communication software for AT commands testing.. DTMFDTMF stands for Dual Tone Multiple Frequency. It is a tone consisting of two frequencies superimposed to each key so that it can easily be identified by a microprocessor. Individual frequencies are chosen such that it is easy to design filters and easy to transmit the tones through a telephone line having bandwidth of approximately. kHz. DTMF was not intended to be used for data transfer, it was meant to be used for sending the control signals along the telephone line. With standard decoders it is possible to send 0 beeps per second i.e., five bits per second. DTMF standard specifies 0ms tones and 00ms duration between two successive tones. Note that the last column is not commonly seen in the telephones that we used, but telephone exchanges use them quite often. Nowadays, DTMF is used for dialing the numbers in telephones, configuring telephone exchanges etc. A CB transceiver of. MHz is normally used to send floating codes. DTMF was designed to be able to send the codes using microphone. In the project, we make use of five numbers:,,,,. Each composed of two concurrent frequencies, which are superimposed on amplitude. The higher of the two frequencies is normally aloud by dB, and this shift is termed as twist. If the twist is equal to dB, the higher frequency is loud by dB. If the lower frequency is loud, then the twist is said to be negative. DTMF signals can be generated through using RC networks connected to a microprocessor. MT8880 is an example of a dedicated IC. But getting the latter method work is a bit difficult if high accuracy is needed. The crystal frequency needs to be sacrificed for a non standard cycle length. Hence this method is used for simple applications. Most often, a PIC micro could be used for the above purpose. Detecting DTMF with satisfactory precision is a hard thing. Often, a dedicated IC such as MT8870 is used for this purpose. It uses two th order band-pass filters using switched capacitor filters and it suppresses any harmonics. Hence they can produce pretty good sine waves from distorted input. Hence it is preferred. Again microprocessors can also be used, but their application is limited. In the project, it is necessary to use a DTMF decoder to decode the DTMF signals transmitted from the GSM 'speaker' into binary numbers. Weighing all the advantages and disadvantages, we choose the MT8870D to fulfill the function among varieties of DTMF decoders. Then it sends the binary numbers from Q1~Q4 output Pins to the input ports of PIC processor. The following work is executed by the C program that was burned into PIC.. PIC MicroprocessorThe most fundamental part of this project is the PIC microprocessor. The device we choose is 8F45/82, a high performance and enhanced flash microcontrollers with 0-bit A/D product in PIC family. The PIC18F45/82 features a 'C' compiler friendly development environment, 5/86 bytes of EEPROM, Self-programming, an ICD, capture/compare/PWM functions, channels of 0-bit Analog-to-, the synchronous serial port can be configured as either -wire Serial Peripheral the -wire Inter-Integrated and Addressable Universal Asynchronous Receiver make the corresponding PORTB pin an make the corresponding PORTB pin an Figure. shows the interfacing between microprocessor and. Bipolar Stepper-motor Drive CircuitIt is clear that the bipolar stepper-motor needed all the windings to be serialized into the diver circuit other than directly serialized with the power supply. Figure. shows the principle circuit of this kind of stepper-motor driver circuit. This kind driver circuit is called 'H Bridge'. The pair of control inputs X and X' controlled the direction of current flowing through the motor winding which affected the pole created on this motor winding. When the X is logical '' and the X' is logical '', the Q2 is off letting the Q1 turned on but the Q4 is on making the Q3 turned off. The current flows from the power supply through the Q1 and flows from the left to the right through the motor winding, then flows through D2 and Q4 down to the ground. When X is '' but X' is '', the current flows through the Q3, from the right to the left through the motor winding and flows through the D1 and Q2 down to the ground. The difference between the directions of the current flowing through the motor winding causes the different pole created. This allows the stepper-motor doing the operation introduced above. Here the use of the diodes must be stressed. As known to all, the winding inside the stepper-motor acts as an inductor. However, considering there is more than one winding in a stepper-motor, the pair of inductors would be like to act as a transformer. There will be surely a continually changing voltage across the winding when the circuit is on. The voltage will possibly be transformed and enlarged. This causes some serious problem to the circuit or even damage the whole circuit. After adding the diodes, the voltage at both end of the winding was clamped. It can protect the circuit from being damaged. In practical, there are also many ICs integrated one or more 'H Bridges' inside. Take L293 as an example: there are two pairs of 'H Bridges' built in as shown in Figure. The two windings are connected across pin, and pin 1, 4 individually in the circuit.. Design PhilosophyThe main function of every part has been discussed in the background research part. The content of this part is designing rational approaches to implement. The connections between the PIC and stepper motor enable the instructions be transferred and carried out, which means the PIC sending the sequences to make the motor turn and generating the quantities of steps to control its pace. So the program on PIC chip should consider and cover these aspects. Initializing procedure is done by some 'include', 'define' and 'use' statement. By the three 'include' text from the specified file is used at this point of the compilation. The filename '8F45/82', 'string.h' and 'stdio.h' are in <> so the directory with the main source file is searched last. The options after 'fuses' vary depending on the device. This directive defines what fuses should be set in the part when it is programmed. This directive does not affect the compilation but is put in the output files. This directive affects how the compiler will generate code for input and output instructions that follow. The standard method of doing I/O will cause the compiler to generate code to make an I/O pin either input or output every time it is used. Since the port d will be used as the input from DTMF to PIC while the port b and c as output of PIC to stepper motor, the three 'use' statement should appear in the beginning of program. This sentence tells the compiler the speed of the processor and enables the use of the built-in function: delay_ms and delay_us. The speed here is in 0000000 cycles per second. The functions used in the program such as 'PUTS' requires #include 'string.h' and the'GETC' requires #use rs232. The PIN6 and PIN of port C will be used as transmit and receive port. But we will only use the low bits of port C: PIN to. Hence, they don't interfere with each other. The two different delay settings will lead to different speed of straight and turning movements. Here comes the exact program controlling the stepper-motor to turn the instructed direction and steps. To achieve this, a dummy program called 'Automatic' created. The basic principle of stepper motor was introduced in the background researchs. The sequences of four pin outputs are '101' '001' '010' '110' in clockwise turning and '101' '110' '010' '001' in anti-clockwise turning, so each four pins of PORTB and PORTC on the PIC chip are chosen to send out the sequences. These outputs are seen as Hex values should be given to the PORTB and PORTC regs., so Table shows the matching between the Hex numbers with the LINE- sent. That's the reason why '\\r\\n' is after AT commands. In general, 'puts' has the same function as ' to be connected to low bits of PORT D on PIC, which are PIN 9, 0, 1,. Wait for the modem's answer. The modem gets the AT command written in the program delivered by PIC through RS232 serial port. So it automatically answer the call, communication connected. Press one of the five keys on the phone's keyboard. The modem received the tone through GSM network and sends it to DTMF decoder through its handset's wire. Communication is linked.. The DTMF decoder gets the tone and decodes it into binary numbers then sends them to the input port of PIC processor. Communication is established.. The PIC processor receives these binary numbers and executes the program in itself. The expected result is sending effective control binary numbers to two stepper motors separately, which will drive the magnet rotating in proper way.. With the stepper motor correctly rotating, we will see the buggy moves in various directions which merely according to the number you pressed. Note: Everyone can control this buggy by calling its number: '77985/8175/812', no matter how far away you are from it. It doesn't set a restrict caller either. When press '', it halt the movement. Press any other numbers, it activate again. You can not try to stop its performance by ending the conversation. There is no design for the 'end' key, which is a defect of the system.. Tests and Performance AnalysisTests have been done all the time, including the tests on certain parts and on the whole system. In this stage, some problems were found and necessary modifications and improvements are made. Problem: (partial tests only on PIC and stepper motor): When fixed the connection between serial port and the stepper-motor, after power on, the stepper-motor turned some steps and stopped at a position. Analysis: Because there wasn't any operation on GSM and DTMF then, it seemed that the problem was caused by the program in the PIC chip. Some steps movements indicate that the initializing is ok. Just the outputs of PORTB and PORTC were forced to a fixed state. Examining the program in PIC, it seems that only the ' the GSM didn't answer the call and sometimes it answered but can't get the correct decoder numbers from DTMF. The best skill I learned from plenty of testing experiences is how to locate the place that causing the problem and separate it from the other irrespective components. Since GSM can't answer the incoming call automatically, we should focus on the AT commands. It is not sure that the commands are sent through RS232 serial port. Now we need to find out whether the ASCII string being sent. When using the Hyper-terminal software, any commands that were tested in the design philosophy part worked well. The response was always a right one, including 'ATS0=' used in program. So the on the RS232 serial ports are the first object to check. According to the Pin diagram and interface introduced in the background, we found out the very pins. In order to find the source of problem, first we check the state of these Pins when in a good communication condition with Hyper-terminal. Connect the modem with PC by serial ports. Measuring the waveform and check the values on the 5/8 PIN modem and PIN PC serial port. I found that when entering the 'ATS0=' in the keyboard, the voltage on the pin dropped from high to low, indicating that the ASCII string is sent through RS232 and accepted as AT commands. Because since this has been done, the modem can answer any call automatically after one ring. Disconnect the PC and modem and reconnect the PIC integrated board. Turn on the power supply and running the program, repeat the same steps as above, but the voltage value didn't change but remained high. So it's the problem of program in the chip definitely. But the sentence concerning with the AT commands in the whole program is just ' the front parts are all OK just the stepper motors don't turn correctly. A good way to decide the problem exists in DTMF or in stepper motor is that connecting the output of DTMF not to stepper motors but to the LEDs on the integrated board. Because the binary numbers decoded by DTMF can be seen through the lighting of LEDs. By using this method, we found that the decoded binary numbers are right so exclude the possibility of DTMF. Double check the connection between PIC and stepper motor and found that one of five wires on the socket has broken. Weld the wire and the problem solved. At last all big problems have been solved by different solutions and through lots of tests and analysis and the buggy can realize its function with a very slow speed. But the performance stability of this system still needs to be improved. The full code of the program was printed later in Appendix and saved a copy in the CD attached.. Conclusion and Future expansionsThe time and energy dedicated to this project over the past months has certainly met and the experiences and skills I learned exceeded the original scope of project expectations. There are many challenges and commitments illustrated in this industry technical report to produce such a buggy and many risks taken in trying something new and untested to me. The final result of project is worth the effort of engaging and involving in it. In the process of trying different approaches, I gained a better understanding both on industry and academy. The big practice like this teaches me how industry works and how projects explore one after another. However, there exist some points still needing to be improved. First, the requirement of resetting every time when the power on, which brings inconvenience to the implementation. I think a deeper research into AT commands of GSM modem can solve this problem. Hundreds of commands can meet almost all the application circumstances. Many of them are seldom noticed and used so there should be one command can solve this. Second, based on the present function, the buggy can be made only recognize one specific controller. This requires a more advanced compare function which can be done by improving the program. Furthermore, it is also practicable to define additional parameters to the modem by AT commands that instruct the modem to perform certain functions automatically when dialing a phone number. The commands that are used to accomplish this task must be placed in the dial string prior to issuing the command. Third, the end of every control communication must first ending with a key '' then pressing the 'hang-up' key. If the sequence is opposite, the buggy still moves according to the last command. But normally people would like to use the 'hang-up' key to end everything. So this should be reconsidered in the program that making the 'hang-up' key has the same function as key ''. It is hard to implement in the project is that the 'hang-up' key in the keyboard doesn't have a specific DTMF frequency and can not be decoded into binary numbers as the key '' does. Last, the movement speed of buggy can be faster by software methods, such as modifying the program. Basically we control the speed of stepper motor by changing the parameter of cycle delay. However, this method has limitation when the parameter has already been very small. Hence another approach needs to be explored to solve this problem. In one word, there is great potential in the future development and improvement on both hardware and software in this project.""","""Mobile Phone Controlled Buggy System""","4318","""Mobile Phone Controlled Buggy System: In the realm of technology, the integration of mobile phones and robotics has led to the development of innovative systems like the Mobile Phone Controlled Buggy. This cutting-edge system combines the power and versatility of mobile devices with the mobility and functionality of a buggy, creating a dynamic and interactive platform for various applications. From educational purposes to entertainment and even practical uses in industries, the Mobile Phone Controlled Buggy System represents a significant advancement in the field of robotics and mobile technology. Let's delve deeper into how this system works, its components, applications, and the future potential it holds.  **How Does It Work?** At the heart of the Mobile Phone Controlled Buggy System lies the seamless communication between a mobile phone and the buggy. This communication is typically achieved through a wireless connection such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The user interacts with a dedicated mobile application installed on their smartphone or tablet, which serves as the control interface for the buggy. By sending commands via the app, the user can remotely control the movement, speed, direction, and other functionalities of the buggy.  The mobile application translates the user's commands into signals that are transmitted wirelessly to the buggy's control unit. The control unit, embedded within the buggy, then processes these signals and activates the motors or actuators responsible for the buggy's movement.

"3035","""Sue 8 years old is single and lives alone in a bed-sit. First diagnosed with schizophrenia when 3, she was admitted to hospital numerous times but has been maintained on antipsychotic medication in recent years. Schizophrenia is a splitting of the normal links in the mind between perception, thinking, mood, behaviour and contact with reality. Antipsychotic medication is used to control the positive symptoms of schizophrenia; the psychotic behaviour defined as thought delusions and hallucinations generally in the form of voices but not always. This medication can induce negative symptoms, consequently known as secondary negative symptoms. Sue has negative symptoms of schizophrenia, these can be summarised as: A flattened affect/mood - extreme tiredness that can be interpreted as being lazy.Lack of motivation and a reduced willpowerReduced amount of spontaneous speechLoss of self care skillsReduced social awarenessSymptoms such as these often persist long after the positive symptoms have ceased, and lead to social withdrawal and isolation (Creek, 002). Currently Sue attends a day centre days a week where she participates in crochet, bingo and has lunch, on the other days she has lunch at the MIND club. She often sits in the library to read newspapers or wanders the streets. Socially isolated, Sue has had no contact with her family since she was 0, she has few friends and recently split up with her boyfriend Terry (who also attends the day centre). In Sues' view her medication makes her tired and fat, often she does not have the motivation to cook meals or change her clothes for bed; this shows the impact her illness has had on her functioning and self esteem. Gather and analyse informationObservations: Her current social skills.Her general attitude and emotional behaviour.How Sue copes/reacts when meeting new people.Interview:I will explain the OT's role and what areas I can help with.Find out her goals, motivations and general outlook on life.Her life before she was diagnosed with schizophrenia.Her current/previous leisure and social activities.Information from other disciplines:Day centre staff - how Sue interacts with other attendees, was there a difference when she was with Terry?CPN - what her symptoms are like in more detail, change over time, any triggers that can adversely affect Sues' behaviour.GP - medication history, adverse side affects caused, can it be changed?Assessments:COPM interview - to assess Sues' perspective of her performance in different aspects of life, what motivates her and what her priorities are.ACIS - to assess current social skills (Forsyth, 998).ADL and IADL assessments - to clarify current levels of functioning in aspects of her life other than social interactions.Define the problemADL/IADL:To maintain a hygienic cooking environment.To prepare meals each day.To keep motivated and maintain a self-care routine.Work:To participate in part time voluntary work.Social participation:T o meet more people therefore increasing social interactions.Sues main occupational needs are to maintain self care routines and productive activity; this will lead to Sue feeling better about life in general. Strengths that can be built on:Sues enthusiasm to carry out part time work.Sues increased enjoyment of activities with increased social interactions.Sues strong will and independence.Sues enjoyment of reading items of interest.Plan and prepare interventionLong term aim: to independently attend a voluntary work placement days a week and interact with co-workers. Short term goals: To ensure ADL and IADL activities are maintained everyday with the use of prepared task check lists within one week. To participate in a befriending scheme one afternoon a week within two weeks. To independently take books out of the library, read them and discuss these at the day centre within threes weeks. To independently attend interviews for voluntary part time work within five weeks. Implement interventionEach goal can be achieved by: Activities will be analysed and broken down into smaller steps, working with Sue to aid her in structuring tasks that need to be completed on a day-to-day or weekly basis. For example: preparing meals - a list of what to cook for each day of the week can be prepared in advance to reduce the amount planning that needs to take place each day: cleaning the kitchen - complex tasks can be broken down into smaller steps such as wash the dishes, wipe the surfaces, clean the cooker top. By crossing off these smaller steps it should give a sense of achievement and aid the structuring long tasks that seem unreachable at first. A meeting will be arranged so Sue and the volunteer can meet on mutual grounds. Sue will be met for the first time and accompanied by the OT. When she feels at ease on her own she will be left to independently arrange a meeting time and activity with the volunteer to be kept to each week. Correspondence will be maintained to continually access the outcome of the meetings. A visit to the library can be carried out to choose books that interest Sue with the aim of her reading them in her spare time and continuing this activity independently, they can be discussed with either staff or other attendees at the day centre. Role plays of interviews will be practiced to prepare Sue for the types of questions that may be asked, this will also help to improve her conversational skills by discussing what went well and what didn't go so well, giving corrective feedback (Alan, 997). Evaluate outcomesObservations:Changes in emotional behaviour, general outlook.Changes in social skills and self-care.Interview:Discuss with Sue if she is happy with what she is doing, if there are any other issues she would like to bring up.Correspond with befriending scheme volunteer to see how the friendship has progressed (with Sue's permission?).Talk to day centre staff to see how they now view Sues' situation.Assessments:Repeat COPM interview, ACIS assessment and ADL/IADL assessments to establish progress that has been made in areas originally assessed.""","""Schizophrenia and occupational therapy intervention""","1195","""Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by disturbances in thinking, perception, emotions, behavior, and social interactions. It affects about 20 million people worldwide, cutting across all cultural, racial, and economic boundaries. The condition often emerges in early adulthood, causing significant distress and impairments in daily functioning. While medication plays a crucial role in managing symptoms, occupational therapy (OT) is a valuable and holistic approach that addresses the unique challenges individuals with schizophrenia face in their everyday lives.  Occupational therapy for schizophrenia focuses on helping individuals engage in meaningful and purposeful activities to enhance their quality of life and promote recovery. Occupational therapists work with clients to develop the skills and strategies needed to navigate various environments and responsibilities successfully. OT interventions are tailored to each individual's specific needs, considering their symptoms, strengths, and goals.  One key aspect of occupational therapy for schizophrenia is assessing and addressing cognitive impairments. Cognitive deficits, such as problems with memory, attention, and executive functioning, can significantly impact a person's ability to perform daily tasks. Occupational therapists utilize cognitive remediation techniques to improve cognitive skills and help individuals better manage their daily routines and responsibilities.  Furthermore, occupational therapists assist individuals with schizophrenia in developing and improving their social skills. Social isolation and difficulties with interpersonal relationships are common challenges for people with this condition. By engaging in social skills training and social integration activities, individuals can enhance their communication skills, establish meaningful connections, and build a support network.  In addition to cognitive and social skills development, occupational therapy interventions often include strategies for improving time management, organization, and self-care skills. These skills are essential for individuals with schizophrenia to maintain their independence and manage their daily routines effectively. Occupational therapists work with clients to establish routines, set realistic goals, and develop coping mechanisms to navigate challenges related to daily living.  Occupational therapy also focuses on promoting vocational skills and employment opportunities for individuals with schizophrenia. Finding and maintaining employment can be challenging for people with this condition due to stigma, symptoms that affect work performance, and the need for ongoing support. Occupational therapists help individuals explore career interests, develop job-seeking skills, and provide support in the workplace to enhance job retention and satisfaction.  Moreover, occupational therapists collaborate with clients to identify and engage in meaningful leisure activities. Participation in hobbies, sports, and recreational pursuits can improve mental well-being, reduce stress, and increase overall quality of life for individuals with schizophrenia. By incorporating leisure activities into their daily routines, individuals can experience joy, fulfillment, and a sense of accomplishment.  It is essential to note that occupational therapy for schizophrenia is a client-centered and evidence-based practice. Occupational therapists continuously monitor progress, adjust interventions as needed, and involve clients in decision-making throughout the treatment process. By fostering a collaborative and empowering environment, individuals with schizophrenia can build skills, achieve personal goals, and enhance their overall well-being.  In conclusion, occupational therapy is a valuable intervention for individuals with schizophrenia, addressing a wide range of challenges they may face in their daily lives. Through cognitive remediation, social skills training, time management strategies, vocational support, self-care skills development, and leisure engagement, occupational therapists help individuals enhance their independence, quality of life, and overall functioning. By combining medication with holistic approaches like occupational therapy, individuals with schizophrenia can work towards recovery, empowerment, and a fulfilling life despite the challenges posed by the condition.""","666"
"410","""In the recent case of Shamil Bank of Bahrain EC v Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd & Ors, the Court of Appeal declined to interpret a contractual choice of law clause as requiring it to determine and apply principles of Shariah or Islamic law by an English court. This statement continues the tradition in this jurisdiction of precluding any system of law that does not derive from the sovereign power of a state to be referred to by English choice of law rules. More specifically, Shariah law does not constitute a choice of law for the purposes of article of the Rome Convention. However, the issue in Shamil Bank of Bahrain EC v Beximco does raise an interesting question: should choice of law rules ever designate non-state norms as applicable law? Shamil Bank of Bahrain EC v Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd & Ors Lloyd's Rep. In this paper, we first look at the current position in England before moving on to make an in-depth analysis of the issue. This paper identifies a middle-way between outright acceptance and outright rejection of all systems of law that does not derive from the sovereign power of a state. We argue that non-state commercial codifications that are neutral, internationally recognized and capable of being uniformly applied worldwide should be recognized as a possible option for choice of law rules to refer to. The Current PositionIn Shamil Bank of Bahrain EC v Beximco, the governing law clause contained in certain financing agreements provided that 'subject to the principles of the glorious Shariah' the agreements would be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The defendants accepted that the sole governing law was English law, but contested that this should not preclude the possibility of the application of the Shariah as legal principles. Potter LJ held that English law was the sole governing law of the contract. There could not be two governing laws in respect of the agreements and according to the Rome Convention, scheduled to the 990, the only choice of the law contemplated and sanctioned is that of a country. Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations, Official Journal C 27, 6/1/998, 034-046. Shamil Bank of Bahrain EC v the Rome Convention expressly stipulates that the Convention governs the 'choice between the laws of different countries'. 'Applicable law' is recognized as 'the law of a country' in various articles. In its Green Paper on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations, the European Commission, in addressing questions regarding the choice of non-state rules, stated that 'n the minds of the authors of the Convention, such a choice does not constitute a choice of law within the meaning of Article, which can only be choice of a body of state law: a contract containing such a choice would be governed by the law applicable in the absence of a the Rome Convention. Green Paper on the Conversion of the Rome Convention 980 on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations into a Community Instrument and its Modernisation, COM 5/84, at 2. However, it must also be noted that although choice of law rules do not recognize non-state norms, there are various mechanisms in place that give effect to such norms. One is the doctrine of incorporation, which allows parties to incorporate specific rules, including those of non-state rules as terms of a contract. However, this only operates where the parties have sufficiently identified the provisions of a foreign law or international code which are apt to be incorporated as terms of the relevant contract. In Shamil Bank of Bahrain EC v Beximco, although it was possible to incorporate provisions of foreign law as terms of a contract, the general reference in those financial agreements to principles of Shariah law did not identify any specific aspects of Shariah law and was insufficient for the doctrine to operate. G Ruhl 'Party Autonomy in the Private International Law of Contracts: Transatlantic Convergence and Economic Efficiency', CLPE Research Paper /007 and Morris on the Conflict of the Rome Convention, allowing parties freedom to select the law that governs their contract. This is a fundamental concept in conflicts of laws. The same could be said in the United States, where the Conflict of Laws also provides for free party choice of law. Dicey and Conflict of Laws. However, the principle of party autonomy is not without limitations. Limitations may involve priority of protective laws, connection to a foreign law and substantial relationship to the chosen law. Clearly, refusing contracting parties the right to choose non-state laws to govern their contracts is also an encroachment of their freedom of choice. The legitimacy of such infringement turns on the weight of the justifications for denial. A proper balance should be struck between the two competing principles. Given the importance of the freedom in question, substantial reasons must be given to justify its violation. Only if these justifications could outweigh the importance of the freedom of choice should non-state norms be rejected. For a comparative analysis of these limitations in Europe and the United states, see Ruhl (n7). A pragmatic concern for allowing recognition of non-state norms is related to the difficulty in identifying the precise content of non-state norms. One cannot blindly assume that all non-state laws are solid and complete. This is true for certain documents produced by several well established international non-governmental bodies such as the International Institute for the Unification of Private the United Nations Commission on International Trade its proposal to introduce the UNIDROIT Principles and the European Principles of Contract Law as possible choices for its choice of law rules regime. This was because the lex mercatoria is 'not precise enough'. Following this line of thought, determining which non-state norms would be 'sufficiently precise' may be a difficult and arbitrary exercise. As can be seen, there are considerable practical issues to be solved before recognizing all non-state norms as applicable law. Shamil Bank of Bahrain EC v the Rome Convention. SC Symeonides 'Contracts Subject to Non-state Norms', 4 Am J Comp L 09, at 18-21. A reason for recognition of non-state norms based on the theory of the sources of law may be put forward. Proponents for non-state norms accuse the state monopolizing the law-making process. Recognizing non-state norms as applicable law would undermine the state's authoritative position as the monopoly on law-making. Denying non-state normative orders status as law strengthens its position, whereas doing the opposite would weaken it. By acknowledging non-state norms and denying them the status of law at the same time, the state 'immunizes' itself against non-state norms. According to the theory of global legal pluralism, the legal orders created by non-state communities should be recognized the same way as state legal orders. However, it has been pointed out that a state cannot recognize non-state law as law and at the same time maintain the same concept for itself, because 'he normative order designated by the choice of law rules is always a reflection of the normative encompassing the choice of law rules'. Not only would it change the nature of 'applicable law' under choice of law rules, such recognition would also undermine the distinction between state and non-state communities themselves. Hence, this legal pluralism argument loses strength after careful consideration. Law Without a Robilant 'Genealogies of Soft Law', 4 Am J Comp L 99, at 39. JH Dalhuisen 'Legal Orders and their Manifestation: The Operation of the International Commercial and Financial Legal Order and its Lex Mercatoria', 4 Berkeley J. Int'l L. 29, at 29. ibid, at 71. The European Commission proposes to introduce the UNIDROIT Principles, the European Principles of Contract Law and 'a possible future optional Community instrument', such that actions 'should be taken when certain aspects of the law of contract are not expressly settled by the relevant body of non-state law', see the Explanatory Memorandum of the European Commission's Proposal of the European Parliament and the Council for a Regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations of 5/8 December 005/8, COM 5/80 final, at. There may be a case for choice of law rules to fulfilling the parties' will to choose a system of law that does not derive from the sovereign power of a state that governs their commercial contract. As pointed out above, non-state laws are usually already acknowledged through indirect means and refusing the application of non-state laws may at least achieve some certainty in the law. Although there are suggestions that the need for legal certainty excludes the operation of a more dynamic notion of the law, it is arguable whether domestic laws connected with greater legal formalism provide such certainty itself. Moreover, it is very common for parties of a commercial contract to stipulate for neutral law and neutral jurisdiction in order to avoid the application of the law of the state in any dispute. It has always been an aim for the choice of law process is to promote uniformity of result regardless of where the claim is litigated. Even if explicit recognition would not necessarily give non-state norms a greater practical importance than the mechanisms already in place, allowing parties to choose a commercial code that is neutral, internationally recognized and capable of being uniformly applied nevertheless avoid unnecessary conflicts and boost the impact of the parties' will. nevertheless avoid unnecessary conflicts and boost the impact of the parties' will. This view is supported by the change of attitudes in Europe and America. Hence, neutral and internationally recognized non-state commercial codifications that are capable of being uniformly applied worldwide should be available as an option in choice of law rules. Ruhl (n7), at 9.""","""Choice of law and non-state norms""","1951","""Choice of law is a crucial aspect in legal systems that deals with determining which jurisdiction's laws should apply to a particular legal issue. This becomes especially complex when non-state norms come into play. Non-state norms refer to rules or principles that are not created or enforced by traditional state authorities but still have significant influence and impact on individuals and communities. In today's globalized world, the interplay between choice of law and non-state norms presents both challenges and opportunities in various legal contexts.  When it comes to choice of law, one of the primary considerations is to determine the most appropriate jurisdiction for resolving a legal dispute. This involves analyzing factors such as the location of the parties involved, the nature of the legal issues at hand, and any relevant treaties or agreements between different jurisdictions. The goal is to ensure a fair and just outcome by applying the most relevant and applicable laws to the case.  In cases where non-state norms are involved, such as religious or cultural customs, the choice of law becomes more intricate. Non-state norms often coexist with state laws and can sometimes conflict with them. For example, family law matters like marriage, divorce, and inheritance may involve religious laws or traditions that differ from the laws of the state where the dispute is being adjudicated. In such situations, it becomes essential to navigate the complexities of balancing these non-state norms with state laws to uphold justice and respect cultural diversity.  The increasing prominence of non-state norms in legal systems raises questions about how to harmonize different sets of rules and principles. While state laws are typically codified and enforceable through formal legal mechanisms, non-state norms may be informal, unwritten, or based on community consensus. Balancing the recognition of these non-state norms with the need for legal coherence and consistency poses a significant challenge for legal practitioners and policymakers.  In some cases, legal systems have recognized the validity of non-state norms through mechanisms like choice of law clauses in contracts, arbitration agreements, or the application of principles of comity and public policy. By acknowledging the relevance of non-state norms within certain limits, legal systems can promote cultural diversity, respect individuals' beliefs, and enhance access to justice for communities that rely on these norms for dispute resolution.  However, incorporating non-state norms into legal decision-making also raises concerns about equality, human rights, and the potential for discrimination. While cultural diversity is important, it must be balanced with fundamental principles of justice, fairness, and individual rights. Legal systems must navigate these complex issues carefully to ensure that the application of non-state norms does not lead to injustices or violations of basic human rights.  In conclusion, the interplay between choice of law and non-state norms is a multifaceted issue that requires a nuanced approach in legal practice and policymaking. By recognizing the relevance of non-state norms while upholding the principles of justice and human rights, legal systems can promote inclusivity, cultural sensitivity, and effective dispute resolution mechanisms. Ultimately, finding the right balance between state laws and non-state norms is essential for creating a fair and equitable legal framework that respects the diversity of the global community.""","616"
"3010","""Analysis on Bards Hall HotelThe current ratio suggests that Bards Hall hotel has more current assets than current liabilities which imply that the hotel has sufficient cash to pay its debt. However, the current ratio may not be a good representative of this as the ratio does not take 'stock' into consideration, this would refer to the liquidity ratio as it excludes stock as it can take a long time to convert to cash. The ratio shows a.3: which represents that the hotel is liquid and can pay its debts. Both ratios are quite high which suggests that perhaps that there is excessive funds tied up in the working capital and therefore the hotel may incur unnecessary charges. The measurement of debtor days indicates that it would take on average 0 days for the debtors to pay the hotel. However, debtor days does not take VAT into consideration which according to Drury 'debtor days should be adjusted by dividing by.75/8 for the impact of VAT if sales are taxable to the amounts payable by the customer as VAT has to be included in debtor balances'. But because the Profit and Loss statement is concerned only with amounts earned by the business VAT is therefore excluded. The same process can be applied to creditors, Bards Hall hotel is estimated that it takes 12 days to pay their creditors which is ideal as trade credit is free. To ensure efficient use of funds, the level of stock should be kept to a minimum, stock holding ratio signify that it takes 7 days in which stock is used up and needs to be replenished. 1.9% of the profit is the return on capital, this percentage measures the efficiency of the operation and would be most useful when compared to past financial data or against competition. Bards Hall hotel's total sales are mainly made up of the Rooms Division followed by the Food and Beverage Department. For the month of June, they managed to make 7.4% of profit from their sales despite both payroll and expenses has exceeded their budget but didn't have that much impact as their sales improved by.4%. This may be due to the increased occupancy level based on the average room rate being lower than budgeted. The RevPar figure has also increased, RevPar is the average room revenue gained from all the rooms that are available and not just those sold. Monitoring the volume ratios like occupancy and average spend per day or hour will enable the hotel to observe the 'peaks and troughs' of the hotel. The average beverage spend per customer is relatively low compared to that of food, this could be improved through up selling therefore perhaps requiring staff training or incentives to encourage them to sell more beverages. Davis et al quoted 'by increasing the average spend of the customer or by increasing the number of customers rather than by reducing costs'. Spends per customer helps us see where the sales are coming from and can be matched with costs. The sales mix doesn't show the least popular items but help to explain a disappointing gross profit percentage that occurred, the reason often being that each item is usually costed at different gross profit percentages. Looking at the statistics, the gross profits are all positively higher than budgeted which imply that the increase on sales outweighed the cost of sales. Normally the higher the payroll costs the higher the level of service offered, it is vital that they are tightly controlled as they contribute a high percentage of the total costs of running an operation, however looking at the ratios, the payroll costs are lower than budgeted. As suggested by Davis et al 'payroll costs can be controlled by establishing a head count of employees per department or by establishing the total number of employee hours allowed per department in relation to a known average volume of business'.""","""Financial Analysis of Bards Hall Hotel""","739","""Financial Analysis of Bards Hall Hotel Bards Hall Hotel, a charming boutique hotel nestled in the heart of the countryside, boasts a rich history and a reputation for unparalleled hospitality.

"3002","""The two texts I will be examining are, an extract from the poem, The Love Song of Alfred J. Prufrock, by T.S. Elliot and Her Face by Sir Arthur Gorges. Both texts share a common theme, love poems dedicated to the narrators muse, yet both are expressed in very different ways. Through exploring the linguistic, poetic and cultural features, I will examine the comparisons and contrasts that the poems possess. I will refer to the texts as 'A' and 'B', respectively from now on. I will begin by comparing phonemes and patterns. Both texts have comparisons with frequent repetition of alliteration and assonance. The long and low /l/ sounds of the liquid consonants in text a smooth fluidity to the poem's sound and flow. In contrast to this, text B uses fricatives to enhance the staccato effect. An 'audible friction' is created with the repetition of the aspirate /h/ in the opening line, and with the hissing sibilants in 'so' and 'sweet', a contrast in phonemes is formed between the poems. Short vowel sounds of the /i/ along with the quickly released /t/ gives the feeling that the word has been broken off quickly or cut short, creating a short sharp abrupt line ending. From Appendix D, Pope, Rob, The English Studies Book, Routledge, London Both texts use rhyme, but do so in different ways. Text A has quite an irregular scheme which appears unsystematic, though lines and do and adds musicality to the sound patterning. Text B adopts a lyrical form set out in quatrains. It begins with an almost Shakespearean rhyme this vague frame has repetition with variation in the penultimate stanza. The structure ABAB is regular and repeated, however again it is rhyme 'A' that is foregrounded as it is constantly used throughout all five stanzas creating a cyclic effect that is continually returning to the beginning. Visual rhyme is used with 'love' and 'move', however when read aloud the rhyme is not heard. The two poems have mainly regular stress patterns, but with variations. Text A begins with a couplet that is an iambic heptameter, although the remainder of the text has an irregular number of syllables and stresses per line, so is free verse. Three lines start on the reverse foot and so are foregrounded against the regular iambic pattern. These trochees change the readers pace, acting as a vehicle to carry the text forward. Text B is a highly regular stressed poem. Each line contains six syllables and three stresses, and on every occasion but one, these are iambic lines. The words are all monosyllabic creating a highly structured formal pace. It also contains a trochee line, which creates disjunction because of the change in rhythm. This foregrounding is further heightened with the parallelism in word structure; the second word in the couplet remains constant and the first word changes, a reversal of all the other lines. In text B the use of so much repetition falls into the background and becomes part of the frame of the poem. When the repetition breaks in the third line, the replacement of 'first' with the adverb 'then', breaks this pattern and is foregrounded. This break adds kinesis and propels the text forward, leaving the emphasis on the word 'hit', giving weight to the action verb. The line changes the functions of the same context sensitive personal pronouns. The possessive pronoun 'mine', changes to the possessive determiner 'my'. This causes disjunction and produces an effect of broken language, which could be archaic, as it is used in a context that no longer exists. This shows that the seemingly safe structure of the text is susceptible to change. Both poems are similar in their lack of similes but inclusion of metaphors. In text A we meet the inanimate nouns 'fog', and 'smoke'. Not only do they become physical things with a 'back', but also animate and carries out the action, 'rub'. This conceit or extended metaphor continues with animalistic connotations, anthropomorphising the 'smoke/ fog'. It also possesses a 'muzzle' which not only denotes a part of an animal's face, but also something that ' expressing their opinions freely' implying that the smoke is smothering and restricting, giving the 'muzzle' a double meaning, making it a pun. 'Its' in the third line is a third person singular pronoun, adding to the creatures substantialism as it has its own possessions, and although the poem implies we can identify 'it', the reader is unaware of what 'it' is in this context. 'Smoke' is not the only personified noun, 'evening' also takes on a life of its own. Being abstract and not something physical, the rules are broken when it becomes a 'space'. This shape with corners implies that it is three-dimensional, which takes the reader out of their normal schema and into a parallel world, where the abstract is physical and the inanimate becomes animal. Text B includes the metaphor, 'doth knit/ mine eye.' Eye here is recast as something other, the verb 'knit' is not usually coined with the noun 'eye', which creates an unusual collocation and gruesome image. The Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Oxford The sentence structures in the two poems have strong contrasts. Nevertheless, both are declarative, active sentences that inform the reader, and both contain the definite article, signalling a close proximity and specificity to the subject, which invites the reader into the world of the narrator. At first glance text A consists of two major sentences that include the main verb, noun head and grammatical subject. The first two lines are a couplet with a subordinated clause. By starting in media res, the reader gets a sense of immediacy that is echoed by the ellipses at the beginning of the third line with the omission of 'that'. Yet the full stop after the couplet acts as a hinge as there is a shift in tense, breaking it away from the rest of the poem. The present simple to the past perfect, where 'it was a soft October night' indicates the past tense. The second sentence consists of premodifiers that are dependant upon it being 'a soft October night,' making it a subordinated sentence. Graphologically, the two texts are visually presented very differently. Text A's appearance on the page means it is immediately recognised as poetry, with capitalisation of initial letters of the first word on every line, and stacked in a block in the middle of the page, whereas Text B can be likened to concrete poetry. Text A uses caesuras in the form of commas or full stops to avoid enjambment and text B uses physical spaces between words to indicate a break or pause. Set in a table-like format, comparisons can be made between this and classic oriental scripts which are read from top to bottom, and when done in this way the poem surprisingly still making grammatical sense. By contrastively analysing these poems, I have explored linguistically, poetically, and culturally the differences and similarities between the two, and highlighted how poems with similar subjects can in fact hold completely contrasting features.""","""Comparative analysis of love poems""","1496","""Comparative Analysis of Love Poems  Love has been a timeless muse for poets throughout history, inspiring them to create verses that capture the essence of human emotions and relationships. In this comparative analysis, we will explore three iconic love poems from different eras and poets - William Shakespeare's """"Sonnet 18,"""" Elizabeth Barrett Browning's """"How Do I Love Thee? Let Me Count the Ways,"""" and Langston Hughes' """"Love is a ripe plum."""" Each poem offers a unique perspective on love, showcasing how diverse and multifaceted this universal theme can be.  Let's begin with Shakespeare's """"Sonnet 18,"""" often referred to as """"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"""" This sonnet, part of Shakespeare's collection of 154 sonnets, celebrates the eternal beauty of the beloved. The speaker muses on the inadequacy of comparing their love interest to a summer's day, which is subject to change and fades away. Instead, the poet declares that the beloved's beauty will be immortalized through the poem itself, defying the passage of time. Shakespeare's use of imagery, metaphors, and iambic pentameter creates a lyrical and timeless quality to this sonnet, emphasizing the everlasting nature of true love.  In contrast, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's """"How Do I Love Thee? Let Me Count the Ways"""" reflects a more direct and personal approach to expressing love. This sonnet from her collection """"Sonnets from the Portuguese"""" explores the depth and intensity of the speaker's love for their partner. Through a series of rhetorical questions and responses, Browning enumerates the myriad ways in which she loves her beloved, from the depths of her soul to the heights of spiritual connection. The poem's structure and language convey a sense of intimacy and sincerity, highlighting the boundless capacity of love to transcend boundaries and endure all challenges.  Moving forward to the 20th century, we encounter Langston Hughes' """"Love is a ripe plum."""" This brief yet powerful poem offers a more modern and succinct take on the theme of love. In just four lines, Hughes captures the essence of love as something natural, sweet, and desirable, likening it to a ripe plum ready to be savored. The simplicity of language and imagery in this poem conveys a sense of immediacy and sensuality, portraying love as a tangible and irresistible force that enriches life. Hughes' use of metaphor infuses the poem with a sense of vitality and richness, inviting readers to contemplate love's transformative power in the simplest of pleasures.  Comparing these three love poems reveals the diverse ways in which poets have approached and portrayed this universal emotion. While Shakespeare's sonnet emphasizes the enduring nature of love through elaborate imagery and structure, Browning's sonnet delves into the personal and profound depths of love through direct and intimate language. On the other hand, Hughes' brief yet evocative poem captures the essence of love as a natural and irresistible force that enriches the human experience.  Despite their differences in style, tone, and form, all three poems share a common thread - the celebration of love as a transcendent and powerful force that connects individuals, defies boundaries, and enriches life. Whether through Shakespearean eloquence, Browning's heartfelt sincerity, or Hughes' succinct lyricism, these poets remind us of the enduring significance and beauty of love in its many forms.  In conclusion, the comparative analysis of these love poems highlights the timeless and universal appeal of love as a poetic subject. Through the lenses of Shakespeare, Browning, and Hughes, we gain insight into the complexities and nuances of love, from its enduring beauty and depth to its immediacy and sweetness. Each poem offers a distinct perspective on love, showcasing the poetic diversity and richness of this fundamental human experience that continues to inspire and captivate readers across generations.""","780"
"397","""Interrogation of suspects plays a vital role in the construction of cases, particularly when it results in a confession. For the police, a confession is a highly efficient and reliable piece of evidence, and is considered as the easiest way of securing a conviction. From a citizen's perspective, questioning by the police can be a stressful, intrusive and intimidating process. Prolonged detention and questioning of the innocent can tarnish the relationship between the police and society. Recent accusations in the media include that 'the behaviour of the police more coercive and imbued with the idea that we are all bad hats until we prove otherwise'. The disgust with which these ideas are reported suggests that society expects a level of fairness and protection within the criminal justice system. Society appears to expect elements of Herbert Packer's due process model to be part of the criminal process, including scrutiny, reliability, equality and the presumption of innocence. Sanders and Young have suggested that due process is closely linked with the controls and protections inherent in the rule of law, which underpins and legitimises the criminal justice system. Their analysis of due process focuses on the 'equality' and 'control' strands of the rule of law. The first part of this essay will use this approach to explore why society should embrace Packer's due process values. p 19 Sanders A & Young R Criminal Justice rd Edition, Oxford University Press, 006 Porter H The way the police treat us verges on the criminal The Observer, Sunday October 9, 006 URL pp 63-73 Packer HL The Limits of the Criminal Sanction Stanford University Press 969 p 27 Sanders A & Young R The Rule of Law, Due Process and Pre-Trial Criminal Justice in vol Legal Problems 994 An inherent danger of the adversarial system is that it poses the state against the individual, a relationship 'marked by disparities and inequalities of power'. Packer's due process is partly concerned with maintaining rights for the individual to counteract the state's power. Some, like Dworkin, argue that 'ndividual rights are trumps which prevail over practical and majoritarian considerations.'. Thus, due process becomes the cornerstone of police interrogative procedures as a consequence of the value placed on individual rights. This is supported by Article of the ECHR. In guaranteeing the right to a fair trial, the statute does not provide for limitations of the right in the public interest. p 87 Easton S The Case for the Right to Silence nd Edition, Ashgate, Aldershot, 998 p 87 Easton S The Case for the Right to Silence nd Edition, Ashgate, Aldershot, 998 European Convention on Human Rights p 90 Easton S The Case for the Right to Silence nd Edition, Ashgate, Aldershot, 998 It is possible to go beyond blindly accepting rights as legal norms, and see respect for the individual's rights as a way of guaranteeing procedural fairness. With procedural fairness comes legitimacy, without which the criminal justice system is meaningless. I suggest that a legal system cannot be considered as just if those who chose to maintain the adversarial system are not prepared to test it by placing their opposition, the suspects, on an equal footing by guaranteeing basic rights. Bentham may dismiss promoting the rights of individuals as lacking rational foundation, and 'appealing to emotions rather than logic', but this can be countered by emphasising that the argument here does not concern the utility of rights per se, but what the rights lead to: a logical and bilateral exchange of evidence. p 84- Easton S The Case for the Right to Silence nd Edition, Ashgate, Aldershot, 998 Perhaps the most significant procedural safeguard is the right to legal advice, currently protected in s 8 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 984. Recognised as a due process safeguard in its own right, it also offers a way of enforcing others. Legal advice ensures that suspects understand the legal process, making them able to actively participate in it should they chose to do so, and making them as equal to the prosecution as possible. To allow a suspect to stumble through a criminal justice system of which they have little or no knowledge is Kafkaesque. The presence of a solicitor during interrogation 'protect the innocent from making inadvertent admissions when under severe psychological stress', thus protecting the innocent while also fulfilling crime control goals of efficiency and rectitude. Those who are sceptical about adherence to due process safeguards feel that legal advice may help the guilty to 'cheat the system' by, for example, entering into plea bargains. This motive not to embrace due process safeguards can be refuted on the basis that the legal advice is facilitating participation, it is not determining the system. If the legal system permits plea bargaining, then the individual is entitled to be able to engage in this with the state. p 7 McConville M, Sanders A & Leng R The Case for the Prosecution Routledge, London 991 According to Packer's model, 'the police should not arrest unless information in their hands at that time seems likely, subject to the vicissitudes of the litigation process to provide a case that will result in a conviction. It is never proper for the police to hold a suspect for the purpose of interrogation or investigation'. By requiring that a prima facie case against the suspect is established, due process safeguards can be seen as limiting the state and reducing any institutional advantage for the police. The suspect is thus enabled to focus his limited resources on refuting or mitigating the accusations, rather than second guessing the state. This equality contributes towards procedural fairness and the efficiency of exchanges between the police and the suspect during post-arrest questioning. p 90 Packer HL The Limits of the Criminal Sanction Stanford University Press 969 Overlapping with limiting the state in order to make it equal is the idea of control: 'the basic idea of the rule of law is, of course, that the executive arm of the State is controlled by law and that its actions are not a product of whim, politics or prejudice'. Miscarriages of justice in the late 970s raised questions of safeguards as methods to protect suspects against 'unfair and oppressive methods of interrogation and the abuse of suspects detained by the police'. Media pressure to allocate blame, managerial performance targets and their commitment to the job are considered to have enabled the police to justify abusive and unfair behaviour as necessary to get a conviction for those who they determined guilty. Not only do due process safeguards offer protection against 'Dirty Harry justice', they go beyond individual suspects and legitimise the legal process as a whole: the 'ideological effect of criminal justice.requires that punishment should be seen to be legitimate and deserved'. Punishing innocent people does not serve the purposes of criminal law. In terms of crime control and efficiency, I suggest that it is more efficient to devote resources to punishing and rehabilitating the guilty: the additional costs that may be incurred in securing a conviction which is not founded on an unfairly obtained confession are far lower than the economic and social costs of unjustified imprisonment. p 27 Sanders A & Young R The Rule of Law, Due Process and Pre-Trial Criminal Justice in vol Legal Problems 994 p Morgan D & Stephenson G in Morgan D & Stephenson G eds Suspicion and Silence: The Right to Silence in Criminal Investigations Blackstone Press ltd, London 994 p 6 Dixon D Law in Policing: Legal Regulation and Police Practices Clarendon Press, Oxford, 997 In this context, the privilege against self incrimination plays an important role. Morgan argues that 'the right that individuals should not be required to incriminate themselves traditionally safeguarded citizens from coercive and arbitrary powers of the State'. Under Packer's due process model, the suspect is entitled to answer questions after arrest, but is under no obligation to do so. Having already been required to establish a prima facie case before arrest, the police are heavily discouraged from using coercive means to secure a confession. This protects the suspect, increases the reliability of the evidence and speeds up the trial process as no questions of barring evidence need be raised. Additionally, he presence of a solicitor may deter the police from using oppressive, intimidating or unreliable interview techniques. In the case of Dunn the solicitor's clerk was held to have been of sufficient protection, such that evidence given in breach of Code of Practice C could be admitted at trial. p7 Morgan D & Stephenson G in Morgan D & Stephenson G eds Suspicion and Silence: The Right to Silence in Criminal Investigations Blackstone Press ltd, London 994 p190 Packer HL The Limits of the Criminal Sanction Stanford University Press 969 Unreported McConville et al have highlighted several arguments against using due process to control the police in the context of the right to silence. They argue that the controls prevent early intervention and therefore the possibility of averting social damage. It would be easy at this point to enter into a discussion requiring the balancing of suspects rights with social utility, but Dworkin suggests that 'rights, by their very nature, cannot be 'weighed' against practical public benefits'. Instead, we must see due process safeguards as securing rectitude over speed, thus legitimising police intervention. p179 McConville M, Sanders A & Leng R The Case for the Prosecution Routledge, London 991 p 89 Easton S The Case for the Right to Silence nd Edition, Ashgate, Aldershot, 998 It is argued that 'silence is the first resort of the guilty'. Studies have shown that there are numerous causes for silence, and forcing suspects to speak may only induce falsification. Even if suspects are tactically encouraged to speak, as under the current legal system, having due process as the cornerstone of the system prevents abusive and bullying behaviour. I contend that the most accurate from those who have chosen to speak of their own free will. The resources of the legal system should allow it to pursue all lines of enquiry, rather than focussing on an easy option at the expense of the individual. p179 McConville M, Sanders A & Leng R The Case for the Prosecution Routledge, London 991 The suggestion that 'different people should be treated differently on the basis of social danger, their known propensity to commit crimes, their responsiveness to social control mechanism.' poses a threat to due process, which requires that suspects are treated equally and that they are presumed innocent. An individual's guilt should be determined on the facts of the case. The Runciman Commission emphasised 'the need to strike a balance between the interests of justice and the individual's right to fair and reasonable treatment to restore public confidence in the criminal justice system'. While society respects the need for police to respond differently in varying circumstances, in order to have confidence in the criminal justice system, they must not fear that the police will abuse this and act arbitrarily. The due process controls thus work towards equality in the adversarial process, ensuring that both parties operate within a known and impartial framework. p179 McConville M, Sanders A & Leng R The Case for the Prosecution Routledge, London 991 p 63 Easton S The Case for the Right to Silence nd Edition, Ashgate, Aldershot, 998 Although McConville et al raise some valid concerns, there is nonetheless a strong argument that due process safeguards should be the cornerstone of the English legal system. By enforcing equality and controlling the state, due process safeguards legitimise state intervention and minimise the negative effects of interrogation on suspects. The remaining issue to be explored is the extent to which the current legal system embraces due process safeguards. Any inclusion of due process values in the English legal system is heavily reliant on social and political perceptions: crime rates, human rights and security threats all shape the way in which the law develops. By analysing in which direction legal reforms have shifted the focus of the criminal process, it will be possible to determine the extent to which society offers protection to suspects. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act been considered as imposing 'the biggest changes to basic police practice since the foundation of the service in 829', introducing procedural safeguards and embracing due process values. It was introduced following several high profile miscarriages of justice which brought incidences of flagrant police malpractice to the fore. Many argue that PACE has 'fundamentally changed criminal investigation, shifting towards a supposedly American model of due process'. They list the provisions of PACE, such as tape recording of interviews and the availability of legal advice, and make sweeping statements that the existence of these new rights has 'undeniably improved' the position of suspects. Taken at face value, this is a fair assumption. The language used in the Codes of Practice reflects strict procedures rather than mere guidance, 'all detainees must be informed.' and is rife with references to rights and obligations, 't is the interviewer's responsibility.'. In theory, PACE has given a due process structure to interrogation, ensuring that suspects are offered a reasonable standard of protection and are not treated as presumed criminals. p119 Rose D In the Name of the Law: The Collapse of Criminal Justice Jonathan Cape, London, 996 pp 5/82/ Dixon D Law in Policing: Legal Regulation and Police Practices Clarendon Press, Oxford, 997 p 62 Roberts P & Zuckerman A Criminal Evidence Oxford University Press, 004 PACE Code of Practice C para. PACE Code of Practice C para 1. However, while PACE provides an impressive list of safeguards and limitations, it is important to consider the practical consequences of the measures. The first criticism is that the legislations itself is flawed. It governs interrogation, an inherently crime control power, requiring that interviews take place in the police station, regardless of the best interests of the suspect. While this appears to place the suspects in a controlled environment where they can be afforded due process safeguards, it leaves low profile policing comparatively unregulated. I suggest that this failure to take a holistic approach to guaranteeing sufficient enforcement of safeguards throughout the process leaves the possibility for arbitrary determination of a suspect's guilt by the police, thus treating them as criminals and undermining the criminal justice system. This is supported by Ashworth's argument that as officers respond to increasing performance and economic pressures, there is 'consequently greater reliance on various covert methods of law enforcement', where the end may justify the means. p149 Sanders A & Young R The Rule of Law, Due Process and Pre-Trial Criminal Justice Current Legal Problems 994 vol -5/86 p 08 Ashworth A Should the police be allowed to use deceptive practices? Law Quarterly Review 998, 998 made additional provisions for inferences where the suspect has failed to mention a fact which is material to the offence of belonging to a proscribed organisation. Maguire argues that the CJPOA 'rather than encouraging detectives to seek other forms of evidence. returns the focus to the interview room, with all the attendant dangers of oppressive questioning, false confessions, and so on'. It demonstrates a policy decision to favour efficiency over the rights of the suspect, making every attempt to gather evidence from the suspect rather than from more wide ranging sources. It fails to acknowledge that suspects are fallible, and when under severe pressure may make decisions and statements which are not in their best interest. Statements that it was necessary to remove the due process safeguard because it 'was being ruthlessly exploited by terrorists', groups suspects, suggesting it is not worth protecting them if it creates the possibility of abuse by a minority. p 09 Reiner R The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: Part: Investigative powers and safeguards for suspects Criminal Law Review, November 993, pp808-16 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994 p 8 Maguire M in Morgan D & Stephenson G eds Suspicion and Silence: The Right to Silence in Criminal Investigations Blackstone Press ltd, London 994 p 26 Rose D In the Name of the Law: The Collapse of Criminal Justice Jonathan Cape, London, 996 Some argue that the HRA, and a greater cultural awareness and concern for human rights have preserved due process safeguards for suspects. However, both Garland and Ashworth argue that at a policy level, suspects' rights are no longer a key concern. This may be due to the fact that 'the risk of unrestrained state authorities, of arbitrary power and the violation of civil liberties seem no longer figure so prominently in public concern'. While it is possible to argue that Article ECHR exerts an influence over the English criminal justice system, its importance for individuals is limited to the extent that they themselves must bring any legal action regarding enforcement. At a national level, there are 'failures to apply the rule of law to the police', with a failure to criminalise breach of PACE provisions. It has also been stated that the exclusion confessions obtained in breach of PACE or the Codes of Practice should not be used to discipline the police. This disregard for human rights and their enforcement impacts on due process, such that the safeguards afforded to suspects are minimal. Human Rights Act 998 p 2 Garland D The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society Oxford University Press 00 p 4 Sanders A & Young R Criminal Justice rd Edition, Oxford University Press, 006 p 08 Bridges L & Sanders A Access to Legal Advice and Police Malpractice Criminal Law Review, July 990, pp494-09 R v. Mason W.L.R. 39 at p 44 In conclusion, given that reliable evidence is one of the key aims of the criminal process, due process safeguards are clearly an essential feature of police interrogation. If the system and results it produces cannot be considered valid and just, it cannot be called a justice system. The threat of 'the Zeitgeist which values managerial efficiency, effectiveness and economy above philosophical principle or the painstaking assessment of empirical evidence' has the potential to treat suspects as a product to be processed. The interrogative procedures of the police should not tolerate unfair, abusive and discriminatory practices: they should facilitate a rational determination of innocence or guilt. p 1 Ashworth A & Redmayne M The Criminal Process rd Edition, Oxford University Press, 006 p6 Reiner R The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: Part: Investigative powers and safeguards for suspects Criminal Law Review, November 993, pp808-16""","""Due process in police interrogations""","3728","""Due process in police interrogations is a critical aspect of the criminal justice system that aims to protect the rights of individuals accused of committing a crime. This process ensures that individuals are treated fairly during questioning by law enforcement officers and helps uphold the principles of justice and fairness. Understanding the principles and procedures involved in due process during police interrogations is essential for both law enforcement officials and individuals involved in the criminal justice system.  At the core of due process in police interrogations is the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which provides that no person """"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."""" This principle, commonly known as the right against self-incrimination, guarantees that individuals have the right to remain silent and not be forced to provide potentially incriminating information to law enforcement. This right ensures that individuals are not coerced into confessing to crimes they did not commit and protects them from abusive interrogation tactics.  One of the key components of due process in police interrogations is the Miranda rights, which derive from the landmark Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona (1966). These rights mandate that individuals must be informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning. Law enforcement officers are required to read these rights to individuals before conducting a custodial interrogation, where a person is not free to leave. Failure to provide Miranda warnings can result in the exclusion of any statements obtained during the interrogation from being used as evidence in court.  During police interrogations, it is crucial for law enforcement officials to adhere to certain guidelines to ensure that the process is conducted fairly and in accordance with the law. Interrogations should be conducted in a respectful and professional manner, without the use of threats, intimidation, or physical force. Coercive tactics such as prolonged questioning, deception, or promises of leniency are not permitted and can lead to the involuntary or coerced extraction of incriminating statements.  Moreover, individuals must be of sound mind and capable of understanding the nature of the interrogation to ensure that any statements made are voluntary and not the result of confusion or coercion. Those who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, minors, or individuals with cognitive impairments may require special considerations to safeguard their rights during police questioning.  To further protect individuals' rights during police interrogations, the presence of an attorney is crucial. Attorneys can advise individuals on their legal rights, prevent them from making self-incriminating statements, and ensure that the interrogation process is conducted fairly. Having legal representation during police questioning empowers individuals to make informed decisions about whether to speak to law enforcement and helps safeguard their constitutional rights.  In recent years, advancements in technology have raised new challenges regarding due process in police interrogations. The use of recording devices, such as video cameras and audio recording equipment, has become increasingly common to document the interrogation process accurately. Recording interrogations can provide a clear record of the interaction between law enforcement and the individual being questioned, helping to prevent disputes over what was said or done during the interrogation.  Despite the legal safeguards in place to protect individuals during police interrogations, concerns remain about the potential for abuses of power, particularly in cases where vulnerable populations are involved. Social justice advocates have raised awareness about the disproportionate impact of coercive interrogation tactics on marginalized communities, leading to calls for reforms to ensure greater accountability and transparency in the criminal justice system.  In conclusion, due process in police interrogations is a fundamental aspect of the criminal justice system that safeguards the rights of individuals during questioning by law enforcement. Upholding due process principles ensures that interrogations are conducted fairly, that individuals are aware of their legal rights, and that any statements obtained are voluntary and reliable. By understanding and respecting the rights of individuals during police interrogations, law enforcement officials can uphold the principles of justice and fairness in the criminal justice system.""","768"
"3109","""The relationship between land prices and house prices is complex, involving the inter-relationship of several contributing factors: the land market; the planning system; new housing production and the housing market. When determining house prices a number of things have to be taken into consideration, such as supply and demand of many different factors, interest rates, population change and movement, construction and production: all of which vary in impact. The economic model of supply and demand, developed by Antoine Augustin Cournot, 883, attempts to describe, explain and predict changes in the price and quantity of goods sold in competitive markets. It describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between a products availability at each price, the supply, and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price, the demand. This concept applied to house prices show that demand and supply have a huge impact. Land is finite resource as there is only a given amount of in each country. As a result supply is completely fixed and therefore it can be depicted as a perfectly inelastic supply curve: shown by the graph below. 'The supply of housing is inelastic, at least in the short run, because even if there were large increases in demand few new homes would be supplied on to the market. ' (Bachine) House construction is a lengthy process, which results in time lag between demand and supply: a change in price and an increase in properties becoming available through either the supply of new properties or existing homeowners deciding to put their properties onto the market. Balchin P, Bull G and Kieve J: Urban Land Economics and Public Policy, th edition. Macmillan Press Ltd: Hampshire. 'When demand shifts outwards and supply is inelastic the result is a large rise in market price and a relatively small expansion of the quantity of houses traded. As supply becomes more elastic over time, assuming the conditions of demand remain unchanged, the expectation would be to see downward pressure on prices and a further increase in the equilibrium quantity of houses bought and sold. ' (Warren, 000)Warren M: Economic Analysis for Property and Business. Butterworth Heinemann: Oxford. If the rate of change of land prices is compared to that of house prices, they have moved in a similar pattern, the movements have just been more volatile for land. Land supply can affect house prices much more in the medium and long terms than in the short term, so it would require not only substantial land release on a national scale but also a consistently sustained policy change to achieve a significant effect on house prices. Land is further reduced by landowners' own expectations. If they believe that in the future land prices are going to increase faster than other prices they will have an incentive to hold the land off the market: thus shifting the supply curve. From the point of view of builders' the incentive to expand housing construction following house price increases may be reduced, if not completely removed, by the resulting increase in land prices. Other factors affecting supply and demand are things such as household income, interest rates and the cost of land, as well as: income elasticity if demand, sensitivity to interest rates, cross price elasticity of demand with rental prices, price elasticity of demand/supply and sensitivity to cost of land. Interest rates are a prime factor with relation to house prices. They impact booms and recessions in the housing market. In the UK housing market a large proportion of demand for housing is as a result of borrowing. If interest rates are low the cost of borrowing decreases, which leads to an increase in the amount of disposable income of first time buyers and property investors. Due to the fact housing is seen as normal/luxury good, with increases in incomes the demand for housing will increase as more people attempt to buy houses, resulting in house prices increasing. This pattern will continue until the supply can match the level of demand, which is very unlikely to occur due to the lag time of production. This also works in reverse; if interest rates increase the cost of taking out a mortgage will be far higher. Therefore demand decreases and more people will look for an alternative, for example renting, and eventually the price of houses would decrease. Loans, in this case mortgages and the house are complementary goods: if the demand for mortgages increase then there will be a corresponding increase in the demand for housing and vice versa. Lower costs of land will also increase the market supply of housing. The lower cost represents lower costs of production; this will increase profitability and attract more producers into the market. Again, the outcome is that market supply curve shifts. A major detail that should be taken into consideration with regards to land is that the demand for building land is derived. Thus, it is lands potential utilisation that is important. 'The price of land is a product of bidding between competing users rather than the simple extraction by landowners of some national residual development value.' (Warren, 000) Developers and others who demand land for housing, have the intention to sell the completed development at an acceptable profit. They will therefore be prepared to pay a residual price for the land, based on the difference between the prices they can achieve for the housing and their costs of production. The price they offer will normally depend upon the state of the market for completed buildings: the anticipated future value of the buildings would need to be forecast. Warren M: Economic Analysis for Property and Business. Butterworth Heinemann: Oxford. 'The demand for property leads to distinct patterns of land-use as different occupiers compete for a limited supply of land. The patterns that emerge result from the differential ability of users to generate profit from particular sites and from the reaction of developers and landowners.' (Ball M et al, 998)Ball M et al: The Economics of Commercial Property Markets. Routledge: London. This statement highlights that development has a major impact upon land. Land is a major determining factor but once the land is in possession of developers it is then up to them what happens to it. Consequently the influencing factor becomes the houses: it is the houses that now determine land prices. The intensity of utilisation in this particular topic would relate to the residential development; number of houses a developer is allowed to build on each hectare; a factor controlled by government planners and the local planning departments, will depend on the type of houses being built. High-density developments increase the value of land. For example, if a developer bought cheaper land and created a high-density development at a cheaper cost the housing could be sold for more. Thus, showing that land value could be low but with high market demand the price of housing can be high and therefore increasing the land value in the long run. In this case it is housing prices that are determining land prices. This view is also supported by local planning authorities that argue the demand for land and thus its price is derived from the demand for housing. House builders contradict this by believing that the supply of land and its cost is a determinant of house prices. Land potential may decline due to its situation where, for example, degradation and exhaustion could occur or if the land has been subject to damage or contamination and as a result it became apparent that the land was polluted or contaminated from previous industrial use or dumping of waste a sever drop in the price of the houses on that site would occur. In this circumstance it is others affecting the price of land. The importance of house prices in the economy as a whole means that, land and house prices are determined at the local level, where a large number of local and site-specific factors come into play. House prices reflect their location, as do land prices. If the land is situated in a particular part of the country: London, for example, its cost is going to be higher than in the majority of other areas in the UK. This is where bid rent functions come into play. These show the willingness of particular users to pay for property at specific locations in a defined spatial area. The graph below compares land prices all over the country. Land price can also be affected by the area around it and the same applies with regards to house prices: what is built on surrounding land can have big consequences for the site in question. For example: 'Imagine a housing estate that is presently situated next to the open countryside. Despite the picturesque value of open space, greenery and its possible amenity value, the price of the existing houses may rise if complementary development were to occur on this rural land.' (Warren, 000)Warren M: Economic Analysis for Property and Business. Butterworth Heinemann: Oxford. Location does not have to be looked at on such a wide scale. Land on the outskirts, near motorways etc. often has a lower value than land closer to or in a city centre. The planning system has a big impact on both the land and house market as it is responsible for restricting the total quantity and location of housing land made available. Planning policies influence land supply through development plan allocation and the need to obtain planning permission, which in turn affects the demand for housing and its price. If permission could not be granted for the specific use required on the particular area of land, it is of little value to the developer. Planning reduces both market supply and makes it less responsive to change. 'Using the example of a free market, without planning constraints, the quantity of land made available for new housing would be expected to increase as the price that people are prepared to pay for housing land increases. This is because there are differing opportunity costs to bringing land into housing use and in particular differently valued alternative uses for different parcels of land.' (Eve, 992)Eve, G: The Relationship between House Prices and Land Supply. HSMO: London. In conclusion both land and house prices affect each other just in different stages of the house construction process. 'If house prices increase, higher profits may be taken and indeed there may well be upwards pressure on building costs as more labour and building materials are demanded but the amount of money left over to bid for land is also likely to be greater. Conversely, if house prices were to fall less money would be left over for the payment of the required land. ' (Warren, 000) Warren M: Economic Analysis for Property and Business. Butterworth Heinemann: Oxford. The value an occupier places on a property depends on several attributes that relate to the building with relation to its construction, the site characteristics and the location of the parcel of land within the urban area. This emphasises that land is a factor in determining house prices but only one of many. Demand and supply are a major factor and due to the fact land has an inelastic supply means its impact on house prices is going to remain fairly consistent.""","""Land and House Price Dynamics""","2164","""Land and house price dynamics are influenced by a multitude of factors, ranging from economic conditions to demographic shifts and government policies. Understanding the intricacies of these dynamics is crucial for buyers, sellers, investors, and policymakers alike. This comprehensive exploration delves into the key drivers shaping land and house prices, the impact of various influences on the market, and strategies for navigating this complex landscape.  At the core of land and house price dynamics is the fundamental concept of supply and demand. The interplay between these two forces sets the pricing trajectory in the real estate market. When demand outweighs supply, prices tend to rise, creating a seller's market. Conversely, when supply exceeds demand, prices may stagnate or decline, leading to a buyer's market. Factors such as population growth, job opportunities, and interest rates can significantly impact the balance between supply and demand.  Economic conditions play a pivotal role in shaping land and house prices. Factors like GDP growth, inflation rates, and employment levels can influence consumer confidence and purchasing power, thereby affecting the overall demand for real estate. During periods of economic prosperity, individuals may be more inclined to invest in properties, driving up prices. Conversely, economic downturns can lead to decreased demand and lower prices as buyers adopt a more cautious approach.  Demographic trends also have a profound impact on land and house price dynamics. Shifts in population size, age distribution, and household composition can alter housing preferences and demand patterns. For instance, an aging population may seek downsizing options, increasing demand for smaller homes or retirement communities. Similarly, millennials entering the housing market may drive up prices in urban areas with more job opportunities and amenities.  Government policies and regulations play a significant role in shaping the real estate market. Measures such as zoning laws, property taxes, interest rate policies, and housing subsidies can directly influence land and house prices. For example, relaxation of zoning restrictions in a particular area may lead to increased property development and higher prices. Conversely, stringent regulations can constrain supply, leading to price escalation in high-demand regions.  Market sentiment and investor behavior also contribute to the volatility of land and house prices. Speculative investment, house flipping, and foreign investment can introduce fluctuations in the market, leading to price bubbles or crashes. Investor sentiment and market psychology can amplify price movements, creating both opportunities and risks for stakeholders involved in real estate transactions.  Technological advancements and environmental concerns are emerging factors that are increasingly shaping land and house price dynamics. Innovations in construction methods, energy efficiency, and smart home technologies can influence property values. Additionally, growing awareness of sustainability and climate change has led to an emphasis on eco-friendly features and green building practices, impacting property prices in line with these trends.  Navigating the complexities of land and house price dynamics requires a strategic approach for buyers, sellers, investors, and policymakers. For buyers, conducting thorough research, considering affordability, and assessing long-term value are essential steps to make informed decisions. Sellers can benefit from understanding market trends, optimizing property presentation, and setting competitive prices to attract potential buyers.  Investors need to carefully evaluate risk factors, conduct due diligence on potential investments, and diversify their portfolios to mitigate market fluctuations. Policymakers play a crucial role in maintaining stability and affordability in the real estate market through effective regulation, infrastructure development, and housing support programs tailored to various socioeconomic needs.  In conclusion, land and house price dynamics are influenced by a myriad of factors that interact to shape the real estate market. Understanding the drivers of these dynamics, including supply and demand forces, economic conditions, demographic trends, government policies, market sentiment, technological advancements, and environmental considerations, is essential for all stakeholders involved. By staying informed, adopting a strategic mindset, and adapting to evolving market conditions, individuals and entities can navigate the complexities of land and house price dynamics successfully.""","762"

In particular I will be focussing on The Winter's a linear chronological order, events moving in time systematically, present situations arising from previous situations. Examples of this are the relationships between characters, specifically those that lead to eventual plot is therefore less plausible. Shakespeare, William. The Winter's Tale, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 996), IIIii and Viii However, since The Winter's a romantic drama the subject content doesn't have to be plausible, the reversal of time allows a supernatural event to happen, this is a common feature in this kind of drama. a drama, the audience is unable to get to know the personality of characters as deeply as they do in an indication towards social importance and the strength of a relationship regarding respect and credibility.

Emma, (London: Mandarin Paperbacks, 996), chapter 2, p.88 Seasonal change in The Winter's Tale marks the dramatic change from tragedy to comedy. When Perdita is abandoned, it is wintertime in Bohemia, the weather is cold and reflects the sad events regarding Antigonus' death, the wrecking of his ship, and of course, the abandoning of the baby. However, after Time mentions that sixteen years have passed, the audience learns from Autolycus' song that spring has arrived 'When daffodils begin to peer'. This merry song marks the end of sad events and prepares the audience for the happy conclusion of the drama. The inclusion of seasons sets the scene for the events that occur, since the audience has preconceptions of spring being a time of new life and happiness, and winter being a time of frozenness, coldness and possibly unhappiness.

SparkNote on The Winter's Tale - Commentary on Act III, Scene iii- Act IV, Scene iii subsection, 7 Oct. 005/8. URL. In conclusion it is seen that time adds structure to a novel, conventionally, it is a factor that remains stable and constant. In comparison, dramas often use time in less conventional methods; this can make the plot more fantastic and dramatic. Due to the length of a novel, a lot of description can be conveyed to the reader. This allows the reader to internalise the characters and environment more intimately, which leads to a better understanding of the novel. Dramas, on the other hand, have to conform to a certain time period, therefore more visual representations have to be utilised. Examples of this are; seasonal changes and the preconceptions these seasons carry; and through other methods such as the personification of time as a narrator. In novels, time is important for the development of character personality, it can also highlight the social importance of characters. Time is an important factor in both drama and the novel, the plots in both genres need to progress towards a conclusion, and time is invaluable in providing this progression.""","""Time in Drama and Novels""","674","""Time serves as a powerful and multifaceted element in both drama and novels, playing a crucial role in shaping narratives, character development, and overall storytelling. In the realm of drama, time often acts as a structural device, dividing acts or scenes to create a sense of progression or tension. Whether through chronological order or nonlinear storytelling, time manipulation in drama can evoke emotions, build suspense, and engage audiences in a dynamic experience.  In classical dramas, time was conventionally represented in a linear fashion, mirroring the unfolding events in a coherent and logical sequence. However, modern and postmodern playwrights have increasingly experimented with nonlinear timelines to challenge traditional storytelling norms. Plays like """"Waiting for Godot"""" by Samuel Beckett or """"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"""" by Tom Stoppard play with the concept of time to convey themes of existentialism, absurdity, and the cyclical nature of human existence.  Furthermore, time in drama often serves as a thematic element, reflecting characters' internal struggles, desires, and relationships. The pressure of time ticking away can intensify conflicts, heighten stakes, and drive characters towards critical decisions. For instance, in Shakespeare's """"Romeo and Juliet,"""" the urgency of time amplifies the tragic love story, as the young lovers' fate is ultimately determined by the swift passage of time and impulsive actions.  Similarly, in novels, time plays a vital role in structuring narratives and building immersive worlds for readers to explore. From the classic Victorian era novels to contemporary bestsellers, authors employ various techniques to manipulate time, such as flashbacks, foreshadowing, or multiple perspectives. By controlling the pace and rhythm of events, writers can control the emotional impact and suspense of their stories.  Novelists often use time as a tool to develop characters in depth, tracing their growth, struggles, and relationships over extended periods. Through the passage of time, characters evolve, learn from their experiences, and face the consequences of their choices. This character development adds layers of complexity to the narrative, making the story more compelling and relatable to readers.  Moreover, time in novels can function as a thematic thread, exploring broader concepts like memory, mortality, or the passage of generations. Books like """"One Hundred Years of Solitude"""" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez or """"The Time Traveler's Wife"""" by Audrey Niffenegger delve into the intricacies of time, blurring the lines between past, present, and future to convey profound insights about life, love, and human nature.  Both drama and novels benefit from the versatility of time as a narrative device, allowing writers to experiment with structures, perspectives, and themes to create rich and resonant stories. Whether through portraying real-time events on stage or spanning decades in a novel, the manipulation of time adds depth and dimension to storytelling, inviting audiences to engage with the complexities of the human experience. In the hands of skilled playwrights and novelists, time becomes not just a measure of moments passing but a dynamic force that shapes characters, plots, and the very essence of the narrative itself.""","624"
"292","""Parmenides of Elea's doctrine is set forth in his poem On Nature, the survival of the remaining 5/80 lines we owe to Simplicius and Sextus Empiricus. This is divided into three parts, an initial allegorical prologue, the Way of Truth and the Way of Appearance or Seeming. The prologue, or proem, tells of how Parmenides is led to a goddess who lays before him two ways: 'That it is and it cannot not be' and 'that it is not and that it must not be'. This second is immediately discounted as a 'misguided route' and so Parmenides is led down the 'Path Of Trust', the Way Of Truth. This leads him to conclusion of 'real' monism: That everything is in fact one, indivisible, unchangeable singularity, to conversation at the Great Panathenea between Socrates, Zeno and Parmenides. As opposed to material monism that suggests everything is composed of a single common material Parmenides decision to include a cosmology that he has to be flawed is an interesting one to say the least. Completely aside from whether or not the Way of Truth is valid or not, which is by far the most hotly debated topic surrounding the doctrine, the Way of Seeming appear to lack much purpose, especially placed as it is, after the section that invalidates it. By Plato's time he was remembered as a spokesman for singularity rather than for any cosmology. Russell, for one, curtly dismisses the Way Of Seeming and it is often considered unnecessary even to the extent that Simplicius appears to have greatly favoured the Way Of Truth in the lines that he reproduced. This, however, makes it all the more interesting, why Parmenides included this at all. The first reasons to consider are those put forward by the goddess herself that this in fact the best cosmology available to deal with this world of change that we perceive. This is fairly practical as there a number of almost certainly insurmountable difficulties associated with living in a world consisting entirely of a singularity, Parmenides felt that struggling human beings caught in the twilight world of opinions need a relatively coherent cosmology, for even though it is all a deception there are relatively superior and inferior accounts of the nature of things. Also, earlier in the proem the goddess talks of how Parmenides 'shall learn them too and come to see how beliefs must exist in an acceptable form, all pervasive as they altogether are' meaning that it is necessary to think in terms of the beliefs of mortals, (A slight nod towards Protagoras), we must find a way of accepting them as they are what defines the world around us. However, Parmenides is not only interested in finding a sensible way to live, the goddess is also keen that Parmenides is never outstripped by other mortals. This for me is a slightly unnerving as it suggests that Parmenides is taking himself too literally somewhere and otherwise he seems to be in a fully allegorical mood. Here however, the claims of superiority of the divine argument, with all the deferred praise that this heaps upon the mortal author smacks of a certain arrogance or in fact a fervent belief in the literal meaning of what he is saying. There are suggestions from a number of quarters that Parmenides' poem is in no way allegorical and that he was in fact some sort of shaman but in order to discuss the rationale behind his arguments it seems easier to assume that this was the product of a rational, mortal mind, like the man described by Plato. Ways have been suggested for reconciling the two apparent contradictory stances, Aristotle did much in this field suggesting in the Metaphysics that the Way Of Truth and Seeming are in fact two different views of the world, one through the senses and the other through reason. This suggests that we should not perhaps view the goddess' concept of a singularity as a ontological truth but as an epistemological one. The Way Of Truth is a perception relying on a priori reasoning rather than the senses and is thus a superior view showing what lies beneath the untrustworthy world of the senses. This image of an underlying world reminds us of the allegory where Parmenides makes his journey into the underworld to learn of the Way Of Truth, for Greeks at the time the idea of an underlying world would be easy to assimilate because of their belief in Hades. This leads to the conclusion that the two Ways are right and wrong methods of viewing one world rather than two distinct ones, a difference that was very important to Plato. Some do not take it quite as far, suggesting instead that the Way Of Truth is really just an important metaphysical truth with bearing on how how we think about the world but The cosmology stems from the first plurality that Parmenides witnesses upon leaving the Underworld where he has been learning the Way of Truth, through the portal of Justice, namely the distinction between light and dark. This duality underpins most of the rest of the cosmology, in a way similar to other philosophies at the time in India and China, for example the Bhagavad Gita teaches 'These two, light and darkness, are the world's eternal ways' and the first principles of manifestation in China are yang and yin, often represented as light and darkness. This sort of duality is recurring theme throughout Greek philosophy. Despite the fact that the philosophers have often discovered something of great import through the application of reason, this discovery's application to the everyday world of the audience was often less than apparent. As is suggested by the goddess, some sort of guide is needed to bridge the gap between the singularity and the world as we see it. Democritus' audience faced similar difficulties, confronted with a deterministic world of atoms and void and being forced, like Parmenides' audience, to doubt the evidence of their senses. Democritus does not leave the audience in a complete quandary but provides a number of appropriate ethical guidelines and avoids completely turning essentials like free will on their head. These are obviously not strongly dependent on the major part of the doctrine but they guarantee that those who deny or cannot follow the previous arguments are left with something to which they can easily reference. This technique of leading listeners to the edge of accepted reason through logical argument and then bringing them slowly back was an important part of the dialectic tradition and a persuasive method. Melissus, a staunch defender of Parmenidian monism, is an excellent example of the division between what reason tells us and the actions we must take on the evidence of the senses, for as well as being a philosopher he was also a military commander of some note. The worlds of warfare and politics do not sit well with Parmenidian changelessness, so through his way of life Melissus demonstrates that it is essential that we view the singularity as epistemological, if we are to find a way of reconciling the two levels of thinking which emerge from On Nature. The philosophies of Heraclitus also ended concluded that there existed two levels of perception, the contradictory world above and the underlying union of opposites. Although they disagree in the details it is interesting to notice how pervasive this dualist world view was. This epistemological debate, essentially about the practicality of data obtained through reason as opposed to the unreliability of that obtained through the senses, is today divided into the realist and anti-realist camps. Realists hold that there is a world independent of the mind that we can make inferences about this in the form of scientific theories, which can then be used to make predictions about this objective reality. The fact that these theories are often able to predict events remarkably accurately is one of the main arguments for this point of view. The Way Of Seeming does in fact have many things in common with a scientific calculation, for example were you wanting to calculate the orbit of a planet you would not calculate the movement of each individual atom you would approximate and treat the planet as a point. The Way Of Truth takes the approximation in a slightly different direction, rather than to the material monism of atomism instead to the real monism of the singularity. A final dualism to examine that appears to have at least some of its roots in the doctrine of Parmenides is Plato's Theory Of Ideas. The Forms have a lot of similarities to The One, in that they are distinct from 'just the things we see', on a different plane of existence. In the Dialogues Parmenides argues fairly inconclusively around the idea of the Forms but it is obvious that there he is concurrent with many of the essential ideas and it is their which he contends most strongly. One must be careful when examining the Presocratics through the medium of the Dialogues as they are always a mouthpiece for Plato in one form or another and one can only hope that their views correspond to history. However, the Parmenides does raise a number of issues that are not suggested by the fragments of his work. One of the most interesting quotations, relating to the uses of the Ways Of Truth and Seeming, is from Zeno who issues a challenge saying the 'supposition that there is a plurality leads to even more absurd consequences than the hypothesis of the one'. This is greatly significant, for it suggests Parmenides and Zeno accept that even their Way Of Truth is an approximation, a less absurd one than the pluralist model, but an approximation all the same. If Parmenides appreciated this then he certainly puts it in very firm terms within his doctrine but that is to be expected of someone so obviously self-assured in his beliefs and the fact that it was deduced logically does give him a right to have confidence. Parmenides Way Of Truth, however, was, as already mentioned, but one of many philosophical world views that contained an underlying layer of order and the fact that so many of these were propounded shows us the beginnings of scientific reductionism, attempting to explain many complex events in terms of simpler more universal entities. Though the Way Of Seeming is widely disregarded by philosophers today, because of its outdated cosmology, less significant subject matter and also the discord it strikes with the Way Of Truth, it is significant in a number of ways. There is the significance that it had at the time to Parmenides, namely that it gave him a documented cosmology that he could be compared with other thinkers of the time so that he would not have to rely solely on his most cutting edge argument, that of esti and the Way Of Truth. It also gives his listeners a slightly more secure point of reference one that is not so far from the world views of other Presocratics. The fact that he reaches the Way Of Seeming with reference to the Way Of Truth both in his allegorical journey and in the line of the argument means that listeners can perhaps see where there own perspective is flawed in comparison to the Way Of Seeming and from there move on to the Way Of Truth. Furthermore, the Way Of Seeming, coupled with Zeno's comments in the Parmenides and Melissus' attitude to life seem to suggest that both of the Ways are epistemological rather than refer to two different views of the same world. The duality of the Way Of Seeming and the Way Of Truth is actually symptomatic of a wider dualistic theme across the whole of Greek thought, a tradition that has continued to this day. Many philosophies involve a two tier system of belief in which there is a layer of order that explains the higher more chaotic and complex layer, which is a forerunner of today's multi-layered scientific reductionism, with the Way Of Truth being very similar to the much sought after Grand Unified Theory Of Everything of physics today. In this way the cosmology is a necessity to show the contrast between the two layers, and to highlight the significant features of simplicity that the Way Of Truth contains. The Way Of Truth is undoubtedly a philosophical work of tremendous significance, highly challenging and highly original, but taken only as the bare bones of dialectic steps it loses a lot of weight and becomes much harder to interpret. There is little enough of Parmenides remaining as it is and to address one Way without the other will lead to a reader missing a number of crucial points regarding Parmenides' intentions, an understanding of which is essential if one hopes to grasp the implications of his main doctrine.""","""Parmenides' Philosophy of Being and Truth""","2549","""Parmenides, an ancient Greek philosopher born around 515 BC in Elea (modern-day Italy), is renowned for his profound contributions to metaphysics, specifically his philosophy of being and truth. Parmenides' perspective on reality challenged the prevailing views of his time and set the stage for a new way of contemplating existence. In this exploration, we delve into Parmenides' philosophy, examining his ideas on being, truth, and the nature of reality.  Central to Parmenides' philosophy is the concept that """"what is, is,"""" encapsulated in his famous dictum, """"It is necessary to speak and to think what is; for being is, but nothing is not."""" This assertion forms the cornerstone of his thought, asserting that only being exists, while non-being is simply inconceivable. For Parmenides, the universe is a singular, unchanging entity, and any perception of change or plurality is illusory.  Parmenides' ontological views reject the idea of coming into being or passing away, instead positing a timeless, unchanging reality. He argues that being is eternal, indivisible, and uncreated. This perspective contrasts sharply with the Heraclitean notion of constant flux and change. According to Parmenides, reality is a homogeneous, undifferentiated whole, a unified and immutable entity.  To grasp the nature of being, Parmenides introduces the concept of the """"Way of Truth,"""" a path of reasoning that leads to a deeper understanding of reality. In this way, he delineates between the realm of truth, characterized by being and unity, and the realm of opinion, marked by apparent diversity and change. Parmenides insists that the senses are deceptive and unreliable, leading humans astray from the true nature of reality. Instead, he advocates for the primacy of reason and rational inquiry in uncovering the immutable truth underlying existence.  Parmenides' philosophy also extends to the nature of knowledge and perception. He argues that true knowledge can only arise from an understanding of being itself, transcending mere sensory experience. This philosophical stance anticipates later epistemological inquiries into the nature of knowledge and reality, emphasizing the importance of intellectual contemplation and insight in discerning truth.  Furthermore, Parmenides introduces the concept of the """"Way of Opinion,"""" a realm of appearances and illusions that are characteristic of ordinary human experience. In this realm, individuals perceive a world of change and multiplicity, misled by their senses into believing in a reality of shifting forms and entities. Parmenides cautions against relying on sensory perceptions, which he views as inherently deceptive and divorced from the ultimate truth of existence.  In his exploration of being, Parmenides also addresses the question of motion. He contends that change and motion are illusory, as they imply a transition from being to non-being, a concept he staunchly rejects. Parmenides argues that being is indivisible and immutable, devoid of any potential for transformation. This perspective challenges conventional notions of change and becoming, prompting a reevaluation of the nature of reality itself.  Parmenides' philosophy of being and truth also delves into the concept of existence as a seamless whole. He posits that being is continuous and indivisible, without gaps or voids. This holistic view of reality underscores the interconnectedness and unity of all existence, presenting a coherent and integrated vision of the universe.  One of the enduring mysteries of Parmenides' philosophy is his treatment of appearance and reality. While he asserts the primacy of being and truth, he also acknowledges the realm of appearances and illusions that pervade ordinary human experience. This tension between the world of truth and the world of opinion raises profound questions about the nature of perception, knowledge, and reality.  Parmenides' philosophical insights reverberate through the annals of Western thought, influencing subsequent thinkers and shaping the development of metaphysical inquiry. His uncompromising stance on the primacy of being and truth challenges us to reconsider our assumptions about reality and existence, urging us to look beyond the ephemeral world of appearances to discern the enduring essence of being.  In conclusion, Parmenides' philosophy of being and truth offers a profound meditation on the nature of reality and the quest for ultimate truth. His bold assertions about the timeless, unchanging nature of being challenge conventional wisdom and prompt us to reevaluate our understanding of existence. Through his rigorous exploration of the realms of truth and opinion, Parmenides invites us to embark on a journey of intellectual discovery, transcending the illusions of the senses to apprehend the enduring reality of being.""","921"
"68","""The advances in medical technology and therapies in recent years have been rapid and have contributed to the increase in average life expectancy. There has also been an overall drop in mortality and morbidity rates within developed countries. On initial examination of this data, it would seem apparent that this trend is indeed advantageous to us and free of any dilemma. However, with further thought it has been shown that quite simply possessing the means to preserve life does not necessarily offer the patient the best option. It is quite possible now to keep a brain stem dead patient alive for many years. But this is neither beneficial nor humane for the patient concerned. The clinician, in this scenario, is prolonging life just because he has the capacity to and not because it is in the patients' best interests. Ethical arguments have therefore brought into contention the role of the clinician in these scenarios- are they prolonging life or are they prolonging the process of dying? For some people 'life' is seen as intrinsically good and valuable and they feel it should be preserved at all costs. But for some people the quality of life takes precedence when trying to determine its value. Without quality, life loses its value and to preserve life over suffering does not seem worthwhile. As doctors we need to observe this assessment of 'quality' and when important decisions are made concerning life the psychological, spiritual and emotional aspects of a patient's life need to be considered. When administrating medications, it needs to be assessed whether the burden of treatments are unacceptably high for the patient and whether extending life would be in the patients best interest. Furthermore would the treatment offered provide a significant improvement or amelioration of the disease process? When making an informed decision, these questions have to be answered. Recent events such as the 'Diane Pretty' case have shown that these questions are difficult to answer. They have bought to the forefront the argument of euthanasia. The word euthanasia derived from the Greek language means 'good death'. Euthanasia is performed either by undertaking acts that directly bring about death or failing to prevent death. The distinction between these creates two subgroups of euthanasia; the former is classed as active euthanasia and the latter as passive euthanasia. Draper, in 998, defined euthanasia using three key points. He defined it as 'death resulting from the intention of a single person to kill another using the most gentle and easy means possible.motivated solely by the best interest by the person who dies'. Within this definition the motive is set and it is this motive that differentiates euthanasia from murder or manslaughter. In events of 'physician assisted suicide', the patient kills himself/herself using methods provided by the doctor. This is often confused to be euthanasia - but it is imperatively not as in this case the doctor did not do the killing. There are other scenarios where practices that involve ending a patient's life may be classed as euthanasia for example, withdrawing or withholding treatment. If a patient refuses life-prolonging therapy, and their decision is voluntary, informed and made with a competent mind and is free of any doctor coercion, then it is not euthanasia. The doctor in this scenario is not intending to kill the patient but is simply complying with the wishes of the patient. To further clarify, a case for euthanasia must involve intentional killing of another person using gentle means motivated by the best interests of the patient. The Doctrine of Double based upon the deontological view that intentions and not consequences are the important aspect of moral behaviour. For example, a terminally ill patient in severe pain may be given diamorphine to alleviate the pain. The continuing use of diamorphine may as a secondary result induce respiratory failure and cause death. The doctor's intention however was to alleviate pain and he/she made a sound clinical decision to take precedence of suffering over prolonging life. If the doctor was to administer a fatal dose of potassium chloride then his decision would not have been based on pain relief and in this scenario the doctor would be in the wrong. A brief look at the DDE has shown that it is very difficult to assess what was intended and what was a fatal consequence. The DDE may be recognised in legal judgements but it is very difficult to apply in practice. Currently active euthanasia is illegal in the United Kingdom. In December 997, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg told the House of Lords 'euthanasia is a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life.the government is absolutely opposed to euthanasia in any form'. However as previously discussed a doctor may, with correct intentions, administer a large dose of pain relieving drugs to a terminally ill patient in order to suppress the pain whilst having the knowledge that this action may result in death. In the case of R versus Brodkin Adams, the actions of the doctor in promoting comfort through lethal dose of analgesics in a stroke given the verdict of not guilty. The doctor was 'acting in the best interests of this patient.' Thus a doctor is entitled to do all that is necessary to relieve pain and suffering even if the measures undertaken may incidentally shorten life. We have explored the complex nature of euthanasia and we shall now explore the pros and cons associated with it. Elements that favour euthanasia include respect for autonomy. A competent patient has the right to dictate the timing and circumstances of their own death. Moreover a patient had the right to alleviate themselves from any pain and suffering. This right is contained within the Human Rights Act 998. Beneficence and non-maleficence are principles that aim to seek maximum benefit and minimal harm. If a doctor refuses to alleviate a patient's suffering and unbearable pain then he/she is violating his/her primary obligation of beneficence and non-maleficence. Another ethical factor which is in favour of the euthanasia argument is that of justice. It is both ethically and legally accepted for a competent patient receiving treatment whether medical or surgical, to refuse treatment even though this would lead to their premature death. The opposing arguments for euthanasia include: killing is unlawful and unjust in any scenario. Life is an intrinsic value and should be preserved at all times. Doctors have the ultimate goal of avoiding harm and loss of life. Under no circumstances should doctors go against this. The advancement of medicine in this era would suggest a patient's pain and suffering are controllable. For example in the case of administering diamorphine for pain relief; is this the only analgesic available for pain relief? The answer would be a sound no. There are alternative analgesics available that do not hold the lethal side effects. But in argument to this, does a patient really want to be pumped full of drugs in their last moments of life. If euthanasia was to be legalised then there is potential for burdened carers, family members and healthcare professionals to consider it as the first option rather than the last. The illegality of euthanasia protects it from being abused. There is also a possibility of physicians making mistakes. False diagnoses, prognoses, errors in treatment and assessment of pain can easily occur which would generate false candidates for euthanasia. Further, the regulatory processes for legal euthanasia would be too complex. The aspects of abuse of power can also be a problem if euthanasia was legalised. In the case of Harold Shipman it could be argued that he was acting in the best interest of his patients and was quite simply giving them a good, pain free death. This 'license for killing' can be potentially dangerous to introduce into clinical practice. Whether we are for or against euthanasia, one thing is surely true- that the case of euthanasia needs to be discussed openly. Euthanasia occurs all the time. It is often behind closed doors and is done in a 'seedy' and often un-dignifying way. Simply because it is illegal regardless of whether the doctor was acting in the patients best interests, often gives the whole scenario a guilty and immoral feel. When scandals are released into the news and press, the doctor is always shown to have done something wrong. This maybe because the situation was kept quiet or because something 'illegal' was committed. These scenarios can also seem unlawful and wrong when people do not have enough information on the ethics and legality of euthanasia. Open debate can help solve this unawareness and uneasiness involved in euthanasia. Open debate could help illustrate that something that is illegal is not necessarily wrong. As future doctors it is our right to bring these issues into light. We should promote open debate and insist that the GMC and other related bodies give their full backing and support when bringing these issues to parliament. A doctor, in my opinion, is negating his promise of acting in the best of interests of his patients if he/she refuses to discuss these matters. An informed opinion is vital if care of the highest standard is to be delivered.""","""Euthanasia and medical ethics""","1831","""Euthanasia, also known as assisted dying or mercy killing, is a complex and controversial topic that raises profound ethical questions in the field of medicine. The dilemma surrounding euthanasia revolves around the fundamental clash between a person's right to autonomy and dignity in deciding the timing and manner of their death, and the medical community's obligation to preserve life and adhere to the principles of medical ethics.  At the heart of the debate on euthanasia lies the concept of medical ethics, which serves as a moral compass guiding healthcare professionals in making decisions that prioritize the well-being and rights of patients. The field of medical ethics is grounded in four key principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Autonomy emphasizes the principle of respect for a patient's right to make decisions about their own body and treatment. Beneficence refers to the obligation of healthcare providers to act in the best interest of the patient, aiming to promote their well-being. Non-maleficence underscores the duty to do no harm and avoid causing unnecessary suffering. Justice entails the fair and equitable distribution of healthcare resources and the need to treat all individuals fairly and without bias.  When examining the ethics of euthanasia through the lens of these principles, conflicting viewpoints emerge. Proponents of euthanasia argue that respecting a patient's autonomy means honoring their wish to end their suffering and die with dignity. They believe that in cases of terminal illness or unbearable suffering, euthanasia can be a compassionate and humane option that upholds the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence by relieving the patient's pain and preventing further harm. From a perspective of justice, proponents argue that providing access to euthanasia ensures equality in end-of-life care, allowing individuals to have control over their death regardless of their socioeconomic status or access to resources.  Conversely, opponents of euthanasia raise valid concerns regarding the potential risks and ethical implications associated with legalizing assisted dying. They argue that euthanasia undermines the sanctity of life and violates the principle of non-maleficence by introducing the possibility of abuse, coercion, and premature death. Opponents also highlight the slippery slope argument, suggesting that the practice of euthanasia could lead to vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or disabled, feeling pressured to end their lives to avoid being a burden on others or the healthcare system. Moreover, opponents question the reliability of prognosis and the potential for medical errors or misdiagnoses, which could result in irreversible harm to patients who choose euthanasia.  In the realm of medical ethics, navigating the complexities of euthanasia requires a careful balance between respecting patient autonomy and safeguarding the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Healthcare providers face a moral dilemma when confronted with requests for euthanasia, as they must reconcile their commitment to preserving life with their duty to alleviate suffering and honor patient autonomy. The ethical considerations surrounding euthanasia extend beyond individual patient care to broader societal implications, necessitating a nuanced approach that upholds the values of compassion, dignity, and integrity in end-of-life decision-making.  To address the ethical challenges posed by euthanasia, healthcare professionals and policymakers must engage in meaningful dialogue and ethical deliberation to develop guidelines and safeguards that protect vulnerable individuals while respecting the diverse beliefs and values surrounding death and dying. Transparency, accountability, and empathy are essential components of a framework that promotes ethical decision-making and ensures that patients receive compassionate and comprehensive end-of-life care.  In conclusion, euthanasia represents a profound ethical dilemma in the field of medicine, sparking intense debates around issues of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. By examining the ethics of euthanasia through a multifaceted lens and considering the perspectives of various stakeholders, we can work towards a more compassionate and inclusive approach to end-of-life care that upholds the principles of medical ethics while honoring the dignity and autonomy of every individual facing the complexities of death and dying.""","804"
"137","""The Social Contract, published in 762 is Rousseau's best-known work and the most intensively studied. Many have devoted their time in assessing The Social Contract in its totality, however it is clearly out of a question to attempt a comprehensive treatment of it on that extensive scale here hence I shall merely attempt to highlight the crucial cardinal issues and give a fairly thorough account to the extent that it is sufficient for a just overall understanding of his work and its worth. The first half of the essay will present an explanatory view of Rousseau's fundamental problem in terms of its origins and nature as well as the solution he proposed which will examine the essence, legislation and execution of the general will. Having illuminated Rousseau's political thought of the fundamental problem and the accompanying solution, the second part will adopt a critical and evaluative analysis of the general will, focusing on its limitations, practicality and relevance in the application to and practice of politics and ultimately assessing the worth of his solution. Fundamental causal roots of the fundamental problemThe diagnosis of the fundamental problem stemmed from The Discourse on Inequality, published in 75/84 of which he theorized about the original or natural state of man and charted the development or degradation towards the formation of civil society. Rousseau's conception of the state of nature parallels the other social contract theorists in that it is a hypothetical condition of humanity before the state's foundation with law and morality. But he extends beyond that definition to envision it as 'an analytical device that signals a special condition, viz., that amoral condition where the only rule is the rule of superior force'. It is questionable whether such a state of nature can ever exist as there can be no qualitative or quantitative measures to affirm its existence but it is an important starting point of which we can compare the effects societal development have on mankind. Noone, J.B. 'The Social Contract and the idea of Sovereignty in Rousseau', The Journal of Politics Vol. 2: p.97. Rousseau's envisioned man in his natural state as isolated, self interested neutral beings with amour de that 'man was born free'. In addition, man possessed natural liberty which was only limited by the powers of the individual and implied no duty towards individuals or from others to them. In essence, he is neither a mere object in the hands of nature nor the will of any other person. In direct contrast, a political man possesses a 'partial and corporate existence' because 'all natural powers are completely dead in a political society'. It is obvious that he conceived the difference between natural man and political man in very sharp terms. Rousseau, J-J. The Social Contract. trans.and intro, Cranston,M, London: Penguin Books, p. 9. Riley, P. Will and Political Legitimacy: A Critical Exposition of Social Contract Theory in Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant and Hegel. Harvard: Harvard University Press, p. 00. Riley, Will and Political Legitimacy. p.00. Riley, Will and Political Legitimacy. p.00. His greatest criticism of modern political society was that it is insufficiently political; it 'compromises between the utter artificiality and communality of political life and the naturalness and independence of pre-political life' which divides man against himself, enjoying neither the 'amoral independence of nature nor the moral elevation afforded by true socialization'. Riley, Will and Political Legitimacy. p.00. Riley, Will and Political Legitimacy. p.00. Furthermore, the unnatural creation of social institutions will ultimately lead to the creation of 'chains' of dependence; material dependence as we depend on each other for livelihood and psychological dependence due to our dependence on the opinion and will of others and to the unruly passions of envy, pride, jealousy and glory to satisfy our amour and the Modern State. London: Allen and Unwin, p.2. Cobban, Rousseau and the Modern State. p.2. Rousseau's resolution for a solutionThe need for a solution arises from a state of necessity when 'men having reached the point where the obstacles that interfere with their preservation in the state of nature prevail by their resistance over the forces which each individual can muster to maintain himself in that state'. Therefore, as much as institutions may have corrupted men but they also offer the solution to his problems; to establish a legitimate association guided by the general will, upheld by legitimate laws formulated by and applied to all to ensure equality, liberty and security for all. Rightly put, 'let us endeavour to derive from the evil itself the remedy which will cure it'. With that, the 'social contract holds the solution' to the 'fundamental problem'. Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and the Social Contract. p.2. Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and the Social Contract. p.30. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.0. We shall examine the solution by structurally breaking it into its various ideological branches, starting with the concept of an association. A. A legitimate association The solution is to transform the chains of the present corrupt and corrupting society making from them fraternal bonds of liberty and the correcting element lies in the general will. This 'association' must be understood with respect to an 'aggregation'. The former has a 'common good', constitutes a 'body politic' and is defined by a principle of unity lacking in the latter. Rousseau applies the former concept of an 'association' to the relation of 'a people and their ruler' and the latter concept of 'aggregation' to the relation between master and slave respectively. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.8. Forsyth, M. & Keens-Soper, M. The Political Classics - A Guide to the Essential Texts from Plato to Rousseau. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 73. The articles of the association can be reduced to a demand for 'the total alienation of each associate of himself and all his rights to the whole community'. Essentially, every individual 'gives himself absolutely' but it is to the 'whole community' that he consents to and under conditions of strict equality. Unity of the highest level is the solution to the dependencies of individual upon one another and is achievable by complete identification of the individual with the whole. This is illustrated in article three of the social contract which states that 'since each man gives himself to all, he gives himself to no one'. In consequence, 'by means of which each one, uniting with all,' everyone benefits by a strict reciprocity of equal and mutual dependence on the unity they created. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.0. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.0. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.1. B. Nature of the Social ContractIt establishes itself as a moral and collective body, compromising of 'as many members as there are voters in the assembly' and by this act alone, it achieves 'its unit, its common self, its life and its will'. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.1. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.1. Until now, it is crucial to establish some terminological points before we continue. The nature of this collectivity is complicated for it entails different roles with different names. Rousseau is interested in determining the principles and procedures of a just and well ordered human community of which every member is subject to a common rule of law for personal conduct and which the observance of such rules is enforceable by all and applicable to all. The ultimate source of the legitimate authority, judge and director of these common rules is the sovereign. This concept of the sovereign is closely intertwined with the general will which will be explored later. Sovereignty is the exercise of this absolute power by the general will and is self limiting, for people place the same limits on the freedom of others that persons are willing to accept for themselves. For persons who have associated together to form this sovereign, to be governed by it constitute the state or body politic. As they actively deliberate the laws within the state, they are also citizens of that state. And lastly, as they are 'ruled by the deliverances of the sovereign', they are also subjects of that state. With that, any subsequent references to the terms sovereign, sovereignty, citizens, body politic, subjects will be in line with such definitions. Dent, N.J.H. Rousseau: An Introduction to his Psychological, Social and Political Theory. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, p.71. C. Legitimacy of the Social Contract The basis of its legitimacy stems from a general idea that 'all legitimate authority among men must be based on covenants'. Since the sovereign derives its power from the people themselves, 'it is always everything it ought to be' and it simply could not be illegitimate. Rousseau does not believe in force being a basis for legitimacy as 'might does not make right and that the duty of obedience is owed only to legitimate powers', therefore legitimacy of an association is fully established when citizens are themselves authors of the law and they legislate according to the general will and execute by just laws. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.3. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.3. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.3. Its strength is derived from its legitimacy as well. Theoretically speaking, its strength comes from the 'common force' of which 'the votes of the greatest number always bind the rest'. By entering the social contract, individuals consent to subject themselves to the decisions of the society by majority decisions and all laws passed. D. Quintessential of the social contract: The general willIn this section, we will explore the concept and character of the general will as well as the methods and devices of which it is discovered, expressed, executed and sustained. Unlike earlier contract theorists such as Hobbes, Rousseau's true interest lays not in the social contract which 'sinks into secondary importance', but the general will which is 'the true vanguard of the people' that defines the characteristics of the state. The centrality of the solution lies in the general will. Cobban, Rousseau and the Modern State. p.3. Muschamp, D. Political Thinkers. United States: MacMillan Press, p.32. Firstly, what is the general will? It is difficult to come to a definite conclusion on what it is due to possible conflicting interpretations however there are two possible trait marks that define it. It can be seen as a decision as well as a transcendent standard or principle. In effect, the former conceives the general will as the legislative arm of the social contract which has a law-making responsibility while the latter sees it as the binding force of the social contract. Furthermore, it is seen not only as an attribute of the people as an entirety but also as a property of each individual. It is the product of every citizen's reason as applied to determining what is in the common interest. Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and the Social Contract. p.8. As Rousseau reiterated, it has to be distinctly defined apart from the 'will of all'. The 'will of all' refers to an aggregation of particular wills and 'studies private interests' whereas the general will is 'real will understood in the social context'. While both are arithmetically similar in nature, the difference lies in the motivations behind individual decisions, while the 'will of all' is driven by individual selfish interests, the general will is motivated by public good and places the benefits of the community over that of the individual. Boucher, D. 'Rousseau' in David Boucher and Paul Kelly,eds, Political Thinkers: From Socrates to the Present. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 78. There is also another defining characteristic of the general will. Its generality in formulation and application is derived 'less from the number of voices than from the common interest which unites them'. Essentially, it is only on this basis of this common interest that society must be governed for if the opposition of private interests made the establishment of societies necessary, it is the agreement of these similar interests that made it possible. Yet its formulation assumes that there exists an objective common good that is distinct from the particular interests and wishes of the individuals within society and that there is always a possibility of executing policies that will serve that common good. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.6. Closely related to the above point, the general will, 'to be truly what it is, must be general in its purpose as well as in its nature; that it should spring from all for it to apply to all; and that it loses its natural rectitude when it is directed towards any particular and circumscribed object'. For it to 'spring from all', there has to be a procedure or process by which the principles are formulated and enforced by every person involved. In addition, for it to 'come from all', it has to be formulated on common interests; these principles will markedly and securely improve the material conditions for each associate beyond what it was if they were not associated with such principles as well as to afford each associate that recognition and honour of their being and standing as morally titled persons. The latter condition states that no one is above the law and none is exempted from the scope of application of the rule even though the extent of its impact may differ for everyone. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.5/8. Even if the general will exist, the difficulty comes about in discovering it. This section will focus on the role of the Lawgiver which is the most anomalous feature of The Social Contract. The role and importance of the Lawgiver has to be examined within the transitional framework from pre-societal state to a civil society. At the start of the social contract, the people plucked from the state of nature are not likely to generate the will successfully for they lack the social spirit, sense of solidarity with others that only comes about after living together within a set of common social institutions over time. Therefore, at the very beginning of its formulation, the agglomeration of individuals would certainly fail to recognize where their common interests lies. Even if they perceive the common interest, there would probably be insurmountable problems of compliance for 'citizens are going to lack an assurance of the cooperative intentions of their fellows and the whole social edifice would quickly collapse'. With that context established, it is evidently crucial that there has to be a special individual to guide the people to frame suitable laws and mould the people into a moral and cultural community. Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and the Social Contract. p.29. Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and the Social Contract. p.29. Henceforth, he reiterated that to kick start a civil society, 'the effect would have to become the cause; the social spirit which must be the product of social institutions would have to preside over the setting up of those institutions; men would have to have already become before the advent of law that which they become as a result of law'. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.7. Following its discovery, the next aspect is to examine how the general will is expressed. The state which is established by the social contract and upheld by the general will is animated and preserved by law. As Rousseau stated 'laws are acts of the general will' hence they 'obligate an individual as though it were self imposed even if he rejects it psychologically, provided he still consents to the social contract itself'. However those laws are only legitimate when they 'consider all subjects collectively' and they allow us to 'remain as free as before' for the laws are merely an expression of what we desire. Consequently, the law is an act of sovereignty and an expression of the general will, which is not to be confused with the government whose sole legitimate function is to administer not make laws. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.2. Noone, J.B. 'The Social Contract and the idea of Sovereignty in Rousseau', The Journal of Politics Vol. 2: pp. 07. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.2. With the expression of the general will springs forth the need for the execution of laws. Such responsibility resides in the government who holds the legitimate power to execute whose authority derives from the sovereign power of the people. It is an agent comprised of members known as magistrates who acts as the intermediate body between subjects and sovereign and puts to practice the public force in alignment with the directives of the general will. It is important to note that there is a clear distinction between the sovereign legislative body and the executive arm; the government that administers laws is created by the former. Despite the fundamental difference, both are complementary arms of the same 'body politic' who has a will embodied in the legislative power and strength vested in the executive power though the power of the executive is always secondary to the power of the legislative. This view of government as possessing merely 'a kind of borrowed and subordinate life' is of great importance in Rousseau's thought because of his conviction that man's servitude to arbitrary powers originated from the confusion between sovereignty and government; to misplace the power of the former into the hands of the latter, resulting in the illegitimate chains of rule. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.06. Having established all the devices necessary for the legislation and execution of the general will, there are some crucial conditions for the devices to function effectively over time. The following safeguards are: Absence of sectional associations: The corporate will of these groupings will reflect self interest rather than common interest and such coalition formation against the common interest must be avoided at all costs. Absence of communications among individuals: Individuals must be unconstrained by any communication and political debates to remove any form of external influence on their decisions. This is in line with the Condorcet's Jury Theorem which states that the general will would emerge from a vote of the assembly if properly informed citizens were to deliberate and decided separately. Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and the Social Contract. p.09. Condorcet showed that as long as each citizen has a better than 0:0 change of being right, than as the number of citizens increases, the probability of the majority being right gets closer and closer to, the condition that each person casts their votes independently is crucial here as if one's vote is dependent on another's, then the number of genuinely independent voices diminishes to that same extent. Therefore, with these two conditions fulfilled, it will ensure that the will of the majority is an accurate interpretation of the general will. Whether or not these two conditions are achievable in practice is debatable. E. Benefits of the social contract As Rousseau stated clearly, 'it is a legitimate covenant, because its basis is the social contract; an equitable one, because it is common to all; a useful one, because it can have no end but the common good; and it is a durable covenant because it is guaranteed by the armed forces and the supreme power'. In essence, the three cardinal virtues of security, equality and liberty will be secured and protected. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.7. Ensures Security 'Distributive justice is at the center of Rousseau's concerns and the purpose for which men agree to live with each other in a society'. Rousseau believes firmly that full fledged property rights can only be established with the formation of a political community via the social contract. In the social contract, every member gives not only himself but alienates 'all his resources, including his goods' to the state which assures each one of their lawful enjoyment because his legal rights to property are respected and secured by the collective force of the community. In all, it 'defends and protects the persons and goods of each associate' by changing 'usurpation into valid right and mere enjoyment into legal ownership'. Kateb,G. 'Aspects of Rousseau's Political Thought', Political Science Review Vol. 6: p.23. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.5/8. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.7-8. Maintains EqualityEquality is clearly both the basis and consequence of the general will. To achieve security as mentioned above, it is only achievable in an ideal situation of equality where each gives himself entirely such that the condition is equal for all and it is also a prerequisite for liberty as inequality would only allow one segment of society to chain another. Equality is also achieved via the general will since all individuals have an equal right to the expression of the general well as an equal duty to obey the laws that arise out of general in remaining master of his own that 'men become equal by covenant and by right' via the social contract. In this manner, the general will is as Hampsher-Monk suggests, a 'constant tendency to equality'. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.8. Hampsher-Monk, I. A History of Modern Political Thought. United Kingdom: Blackwell Publishers, p. 83. Achieve LibertyFreedom may have become problematic but any solution must preserve this vital feature of man's being. In this essay, freedom and liberty shall be used interchangeably. In order to understand how man 'remains as free as before', it is crucial to understand the different strands of freedom so as to comprehend how it allows man to acquire a new and better form of freedom and still remain 'as free as before'. As Rousseau emphasized, 'civil association is the most voluntary act in the world', such an act of association produces a fundamental change in the nature of the associates. In essence, 'what man loses by the social contract are his natural liberty and the absolute right to anything that tempts him and that he can take; what he gains by the social contract is civil liberty and the legal right to property in what he possesses', which enables one to 'remain as free as before'. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.5/8. In simplistic terms, moral freedom is achieved when individual respects the laws that they have agreed to for laws are essential for preserving freedom. After all, Rousseau emphasizes in The Social Contract that man acquires moral freedom which enables him to transcend the 'mere impulses of appetite' to be a 'master of himself' since the 'obedience to a law one prescribes to oneself is freedom'. The core issue is not that the our civil condition presents us with moral attributes we lacked or neglected before but rather there is an enforcement of law according to the general will which requires us to live by them and 'make us effective followers of our own reason, creatures who actually enact the law of reason which is within us'. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.5/8. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.5/8. Dent, N.J.H. Rousseau: An Introduction to his Psychological, Social and Political Theory. p.07. Closely related to the above notion of moral freedom lies civil liberty which denotes freedom that is limited by the general will but gives the individual the legal right to possessions i.e. property. It refers to the freedom to act according to one self prescribed law because each individual is a participant in the law making process by voting. In the civil society, civil freedom is ensured when people as a sovereign have the power to enact and amend laws according to their common interest and the social contract is annulled once the general will does not dominate. Hence, Hobbes rightly asserts the 'practical worthlessness of natural freedom' of which we would sacrifice that in favour of civil liberty. Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and the Social Contract. p.1. Henceforth, his thesis relies on the claim that each individual wills the general will in order to argue that obedience to that general will is not a restriction on their freedom. With that, he effectively legitimizes the rule of law for if men are by nature free and equal in respect of all authority, their subjection to authoritative constraints can only be justified if the authority consented to is seen to be in their own interests, where interests are defined on the basis of the initial basis or position of freedom, security and equality. Critical analysis: Solution creating more problems? To fully grasp Rousseau's solution to the fundamental problem, it is insufficient to simply highlight the theoretical aspect of it. As we challenge Rousseau's solution by questioning his assumptions and generalizations, we open up another question in this field of enquiry; whether his theoretical solution can exist as a practical solution to the fundamental problem. With that, more questions arise. To what extent is it a legitimate solution? Is it not a solution that leads to more problems? Such areas of doubt will be examined below, though there may not be adequate answers to the questions raised, yet the fact that there are questionable areas speaks sufficiently for the theory. The General WillThe general will is at the heart of Rousseau's solution to the fundamental problem and the central concern about it lies with the issue of whether the general will can err. There is always a margin of error when drafting the general will, after all, he asserts that 'it does not follow from it that the people's deliberations are always equally upright. One always want one's goods but one does not always see it: one can never corrupt the people but one can often cause it to be mistaken and only when it does, does it appear to want what is bad'. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.2. The margin of error increases when we consider the implausibility of subordination of one's private interest to public interest. He neglects the inclination of man to want what is good instead of willing what is good. After all, we are dealing with 'men as they are', why would individuals not pursue their particular interests at the expense of the common good? The only reason he provides that avoids this situation is that individual good and common good are not mutually exclusive though he still 'needs to make the step from individuals seeking that good to the collective successfully doing so'. Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and the Social Contract. p.04. Furthermore, even if individuals in a society theoretically desire the public good over self interest, Rousseau fails to prove that every individual has the reasoning, judgment and information to rightly discern the public interest and vote for it. This is especially probable because politics is an art, not a science, the common interests is felt, not calculated. Muschamp, D. Political Thinkers. p. 34 Most importantly, the general will itself is an ambiguous intangible concept. Similar to Hegel's rational organic state, it is not an empirical item discoverable by a simple majority vote that can be discerned by any electoral measures. Rousseau is weak on saying what a general will should include even though he covered extensively on what it should exclude. He does not give examples of the political institutions or society he thought necessary to embody and realize it. Who are the people to decide the general will? How would one know and why should that answer be preferred to another? What sort of agendas should be decided? What should be on the agenda and what should be omitted? Theoretically a general will can exist but logically speaking, the ideas of generality and will are mutually exclusive. Will, whatever its crudity as a psychological construct, is characteristically a concept of individuality, of particularity; it is only metaphorically that the will can be spoken of as general. Hence it becomes only a model of perfection. The lawgiver In the words of Rousseau, the lawgiver is an 'extraordinary man in the state'; he is to be aware of the passions that animate man yet not be subjected to those passions himself because if he were, he would not provide the guidance necessary for the people. Rousseau presents him as one with many tasks and responsibilities but fail to explain how he is going to perform all of them. After all, does such a mystical figure exist in reality? Even if he exists, where is he to be found? For someone with such a stature and knowledge, he must have been someone from another polity who has already been reshaped by participation in a political civil order. But it leads to the same problem of circularity of which the lawgiver is meant to resolve: how did the people of the lawgiver's native country get themselves guided to just laws? Bertram, Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Rousseau and the Social Contract. p.34. Hence, it is questionable whether the lawgiver is a plausible genius in reality. FreedomRousseau admits in the last four chapters of The Social Contract that 'freedom is not a fruit of every climate, and it is not therefore within the capacity of every people' which downplays the plausible success of laws that are representative of the general will. Indeed, he shifts his focus from the achievement of individual freedom to how differing traits and circumstances of 'a people' affect their receptivity to law. Such factors will include differences in 'time of maturity', 'size and population' and habits and characteristics of people. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.24. Indeed, Rousseau contends that small countries are most conducive to individual freedom. The inverse relation between extent of freedom and size of country arises the 'more the social bond is stretched, the slacker it becomes'. Rousseau, The Social Contract. p.1. To put it simply, if I as private citizen obey myself as sovereign in a state of citizens, I contribute / to the sovereign authority, yet experience its full constraints. Hence, the larger the state, the more disproportionate the relationship between my obedience as subject and my role as sovereign in prescribing a law to myself, by extension, freedom and legitimacy is more easily achieved in small states. Linked to the notion of freedom is the accusation raised against strands of tyranny in Rousseau's theory. Some totalitarian aspects include his doctrines on the civil religion 'to make the people think they want what some have decided they ought to want', the abuse of power of the lawgiver and the death penalty who could be imposed on anyone who does not adhere to the general will. It seems plausible that the rule of the majority could lead to the tyranny of the majority, resulting in the coercion of minority groups, as evident in the spirit of Robespierre and the vanguard party of Lenin. Clearly, as J W Chapman stated, it is a fine example of ''achieving liberal ideas by totalitarian means' of which the intentions may be right but the means may be misguided. Quote by Lester G Crocker in McManners, J. 'The Social Contract and Rousseau's Revolt against Society', in Cranston, M. & Peters, R.S. et and Rousseau: A collection of critical essays. New York: Doubleday and Co, p. 93. Quote by J. W. Chapman in McManners, J. 'The Social Contract and Rousseau's Revolt against Society', in Cranston, M. & Peters, R.S. et and Rousseau: A collection of critical essays. New York: Doubleday and Co, p. 94. Although Rousseau suggested some safeguards against tyranny, such safeguards would only hold true in his ideal polity where people are ruled by reason and hence the general will within a community truly represents what people want and laws as determined by majority decision are accurately representations of the general will. In our imperfect reality, his political philosophy would be allowing totalitarian measures. Practical worth: credible solution to a hypothetical problem? In effect, it is a theory detached from reality. It becomes evident that there are too many conditions to be fulfilled in order to achieve this ideal solution. Its implausibility arises from his method of laying down one contract containing one set of terms that was applicable to any and all societies and his reliance on arguments not based on historical premise and quantifiable research that leads to its fallacy. As such if we take the worth of any political theory to be weighed in relative terms such as its theoretical credibility and relevance to practical politics, it is safe to assert that Rousseau presents a solution to the fundamental problem but not the best nor most practical solution. Conclusion Even with its limitations and drawbacks as a practical solution, it will be unfair for us to impose our expectations of the theory before understanding his intentions. What Rousseau intended was to formulate an ideal civil society to which we should aware of and we should all aspire towards. He brings us through what is needed if individuals are to be liberated from the will of others and addresses faults in political culture and institutions that are plainly still with us in contrast to the idealistic social contract model he offers. By this manner, the strength of his theory lies in raising awareness of what is lacking and inadequate in civil society, for once we have identified the conditions of legitimate authority; we can see how impossible it would be to create it, so we are saddled with the inferior and illegitimate sort of societies which actually prevail. By deliberating resorting to such a paradox, he is not concerned to deny the received opinion which the paradox appears to challenge but to alert the reader of something which he might otherwise overlook. His fundamental focus is to provide a theoretical justification for the republic and not to the practical question of how it can be brought into existence. This is a doctrine whose only claim is to provide a solution to hypothetical problems and which does not pretend to offer a historical reconstruction of the way in which political societies evolved. Rousseau's purpose is to deal with the justification of society, not its origins. Henceforth, if we examined the fundamental problem and his accompanying solution to it with his intentions in mind, it is a noble attempt to fuse individual consent with the most distinctive and profound elements of contract theory, with his perfect unified ancient models built upon a foundational idea of the morality of the common good to bridge the connection between individual and state, such that each gains a fuller meaning.""","""Rousseau's Social Contract Theory""","6984","""Jean-Jacques Rousseau, an influential 18th-century French philosopher, is best known for his work """"The Social Contract."""" This seminal piece provides a foundational framework for understanding the relationship between individuals and society. Rousseau's social contract theory revolves around the idea of the general will, which reflects the common good of the community and serves as the basis for legitimate political authority. In this essay, we will delve deep into Rousseau's social contract theory, examining its key concepts, implications, and criticisms.  Rousseau's social contract theory emerges from his deep concern for human freedom, morality, and political legitimacy. At the core of his theory is the notion that individuals enter into a social contract with one another to form a community that is governed by the general will. According to Rousseau, the general will represents the collective interests and common good of the community, transcending the sum of individual desires and preferences. In this sense, the general will is not simply a numerical majority but rather a moral and political consensus that reflects the true essence of a just society.  Central to Rousseau's social contract theory is the idea of the state of nature, a hypothetical condition in which individuals exist before the formation of society and government. In this state, humans are free and equal, guided by natural instincts and desires. However, as society develops, inequalities emerge, leading to competition, conflict, and a loss of freedom. Rousseau argues that the social contract, through which individuals voluntarily give up some of their natural rights in exchange for the benefits of civil society, is necessary to preserve freedom and advance the common good.  Rousseau distinguishes between the individual will and the general will, highlighting the tension between personal interests and the collective good. While the individual will reflects the desires and preferences of each person, the general will represents the unified will of the community. According to Rousseau, individuals must subordinate their self-interest to the general will to ensure the well-being of society as a whole. This principle of subordination to the general will is essential for the functioning of a just and legitimate political order.  The social contract, as envisioned by Rousseau, involves a mutual agreement among individuals to establish a political community based on the general will. Through this contract, individuals create a sovereign authority that represents the collective will of the people. This sovereign authority, whether in the form of a direct democracy or a representative government, is responsible for enacting laws that promote the common good and safeguard individual freedom. By obeying the laws that are derived from the general will, individuals uphold their allegiance to the community and contribute to its stability and harmony.  Rousseau's social contract theory has profound implications for understanding the nature of political authority, legitimacy, and citizenship. Unlike earlier contract theorists such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, who focused on individual rights and self-preservation, Rousseau emphasizes the importance of the community and the general will in shaping political life. According to Rousseau, legitimate political authority arises from the voluntary consent of individuals to abide by the laws that are in accordance with the general will. This conception of legitimate authority stands in contrast to authoritarian regimes that rely on coercion and force to maintain control.  Moreover, Rousseau's emphasis on the general will as the foundation of political legitimacy challenges conventional notions of democracy and representation. In Rousseau's view, true democracy involves active participation by citizens in the political process, where each individual has a say in shaping the laws and policies that govern society. This direct engagement with the general will is essential for ensuring that political decisions align with the common good and reflect the genuine interests of the people.  Critics of Rousseau's social contract theory have raised several objections to his ideas, particularly regarding the feasibility of implementing a system based on the general will. Some argue that the concept of the general will is ambiguous and open to manipulation by those in power, leading to potential tyranny and oppression. Others question the extent to which individuals can truly act in accordance with the general will, given the diverse interests and perspectives within society. Critics also point out the challenges of reconciling individual freedom with the demands of the general will, highlighting the tension between autonomy and collective responsibility.  Despite these criticisms, Rousseau's social contract theory remains a significant contribution to political philosophy, inspiring debates on the nature of social justice, democracy, and citizenship. His emphasis on the primacy of the general will and the importance of civic virtue continues to resonate in contemporary discussions on political ethics and governance. By underscoring the need for individuals to transcend their self-interest and engage with the common good, Rousseau challenges us to rethink our understanding of political community and the responsibilities of citizenship.  In conclusion, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's social contract theory offers a compelling vision of political life based on the principles of freedom, equality, and the general will. By exploring the dynamics of the social contract, the state of nature, and the relationship between individual and collective interests, Rousseau invites us to reflect on the nature of legitimate authority and the foundations of a just society. While his theory has faced criticism and debate, its enduring influence underscores the enduring relevance of Rousseau's ideas for understanding the complexities of human nature and the challenges of living together in a shared political community.""","1051"
"3143","""This essay describes and discusses the third stage of labour and the types of management available. It gives some background and history of third stage management and the use of oxytocics. It examines the research evidence comparing the two approaches, active and physiological, to determine which method is the safest. This essay also raises some questions regarding the third stage that are not satisfactorily studied and require further research. The third stage of labour is the period following the birth of the baby until the complete delivery of the placenta and membranes. It usually lasts between and 5/8 minutes but can take up to an because of the risk of postpartum ten maternal deaths due to PPH in the triennium a pure form of synthetic oxytocin was synthesized and marketed in the 95/80' developed and introduced in the early 960' are: The prophylactic administration of an oxytocic drug with the birth of the anterior signs of separation, to deliver the placenta and and takes effect in - the delivery of the may enable them to feel more secure. RESEARCH EVIDENCEMeticulously designed and executed randomised controlled been named the 'gold standard' of quantitative some would argue that an RCT gives an untrue image of objectivity and fails to appreciate the uniqueness of individual human nature by applying a controlling and reductionist by authors with many years of clinical experience and observation. The databases accessed during the search for research evidence for this essay were The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled compared the outcomes of active versus physiological management of the third stage of labour. They are: Bristol 988, Dublin 990, Brighton 993, Abu Dhabi 997 and Hinchingbrooke 998. All these studies were undertaken in a hospital setting. Four of these trials were of good methodological '.other serious complications of the third stage of labour.' (Prendiville et al 000 p4). When ergometrine is a component of the oxytocic there is an increased risk of unpleasant side effects and hypertension. Recommendations for practice are that active management should be routine for women expecting a vaginal birth in hospital. DISCUSSIONThere is general agreement that postnatal blood loss exceeding 00 ml constitutes a postpartum haemorrhage. But, how significant is a blood loss of 00 ml in woman who is well nourished, healthy and doesn't have anaemia? Postpartum haemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal death in the world, accounting for approximately 5/80,00 deaths a. The only differential effect due to the two policies was a higher mean birth weight in babies in the physiological groups of 5/8g and 7g respectively. This is probably due to extra blood received through delayed cord roughly 0-0 mg more iron, which can help prevent depletion of iron stores in later infancy. This information may be especially significant for children in developing countries where iron deficiency anaemia is carried out in a unit where midwives were experienced in physiological third stage management. However statistics are not available for rates of physiological management before the trial ads that the physiological processes are highly disturbed. He stresses the importance of a perfectly adjusted thermo-environment because cold will increase the concentrations of the woman. Studies from Japan show associations between PPH and high levels of catecholamines (Odent 998). Odent and Buckley advocate privacy and unhurried, uninterrupted contact between mother and baby as well as skin-to-skin and eye-to-eye contact and breastfeeding, which influence the release of maternal oxytocin. Buckley states, '.these are practices that are sensible, intuitive and safe.' (Buckley 001 p33). An integral part of the report Changing Childbirth is the provision of choice (Featherstone 001). In the Hinchingbrooke trial 2% of the women who were eligible to take part declined because they specifically requested physiological third stage management. Therefore it is clear that if women are offered physiological management as a reasonable option, many will choose it (Rogers and Wood 003). The authors of the Hinchingbrooke trial recommend that student midwives be taught the principles of physiological management with an emphasis on recognising deviations from the norm and that midwives who are confident and competent with this method should be valued (Rogers and Wood 003). CONCLUSION This essay concludes that the active management of the third stage of labour is safer in terms of amount of blood loss and instance of PPH. More evidence is needed on the neonatal effects of immediate versus delayed cord clamping and third stage management in non-hospital settings and the developing world. It is crucial that women are given informed choice regarding their third stage care, ideally early in the antenatal period. Decisions on individual care should include the weight that women and caregivers place on the risk of PPH and transfusion versus the perceived advantages of non-intervention. Midwives should be trained and remain skilled in physiological third stage management in order to provide choice for women. One survey of midwives' physiological third stage practice showed 7 variations in method, with only 3% of midwives describing safe physiological third stage management (Featherstone 001). It would be unfortunate for the midwifery skills required to facilitate a natural and physiological third stage to be lost, and women's' choice limited in the process.""","""Third stage of labour management""","1093","""The third stage of labor is a crucial phase in the birthing process that often receives less attention compared to the first and second stages. This stage involves the delivery of the placenta and the final steps in ensuring the mother's well-being postpartum. Proper management of the third stage of labor is essential to prevent complications and promote a healthy recovery for the mother. Let's delve into the key aspects of third stage labor management, including how it is managed in a healthcare setting and some common interventions used to facilitate this stage.  During the third stage of labor, which typically begins right after the baby is born, the uterus continues to contract to expel the placenta from the mother's body. This stage is crucial as it helps prevent postpartum hemorrhage, which is a significant cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Healthcare providers closely monitor the mother during this stage to ensure that the placenta is delivered completely and that the uterus contracts effectively to minimize bleeding.  One common method used to manage the third stage of labor is active management. Active management involves interventions such as administering a uterotonic medication, controlled cord traction, and uterine massage to facilitate the expulsion of the placenta. The administration of a uterotonic drug (such as oxytocin or misoprostol) helps the uterus contract more effectively, reducing the risk of hemorrhage. Controlled cord traction involves gently pulling on the umbilical cord while applying counterpressure to the uterus to aid in the delivery of the placenta. Uterine massage helps the uterus contract and expel any remaining blood clots, ensuring that the uterus remains firm and well-contracted.  In contrast, expectant management involves allowing the placenta to be delivered spontaneously without interventions unless there are signs of complications. While expectant management may be appropriate in certain situations, such as in low-risk births where the mother and baby are both stable, active management is often preferred in healthcare settings due to its effectiveness in reducing the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.  In addition to active management, delayed cord clamping is another practice that has gained popularity in recent years. Delayed cord clamping involves waiting to clamp and cut the umbilical cord until after the placenta is delivered or until the cord stops pulsating. This practice allows for the transfer of additional blood from the placenta to the baby, which can have potential benefits such as increased iron stores and improved neonatal outcomes.  Once the placenta is delivered, healthcare providers assess the placenta to ensure that it is complete and that no fragments are retained in the uterus, which could lead to complications such as postpartum hemorrhage or infection. The healthcare team also monitors the mother for any signs of excessive bleeding, uterine atony (lack of uterine tone), or other complications that may arise during the postpartum period.  After the placenta is delivered, the focus shifts to caring for the mother in the immediate postpartum period. This includes monitoring vital signs, assessing uterine tone, checking for signs of excessive bleeding, and providing pain relief as needed. Skin-to-skin contact between the mother and baby is encouraged as it has been shown to promote bonding, breastfeeding initiation, and overall maternal-infant well-being.  In conclusion, the third stage of labor plays a vital role in the birthing process and requires careful management to ensure the well-being of both the mother and baby. Active management, including the use of uterotonic medications, controlled cord traction, and uterine massage, is a common approach to facilitating the delivery of the placenta and reducing the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Delayed cord clamping and thorough assessment of the placenta are also important aspects of third stage labor management. By implementing evidence-based practices and closely monitoring the mother during this stage, healthcare providers can help promote a smooth transition to the postpartum period and support the mother's recovery after childbirth.""","789"
"187","""The Law of one price, LOOP, and Purchasing Power Parity theory, PPP, are amongst the oldest and most important economic theories due to their use in theorems attempting to explain Exchange Rate movements. The relevance and actual evidence of these hypotheses is still the subject of much debate and research. The initial assumptions for both hypotheses are that there are no barriers to trade and no associated costs. The models assume no transport costs and perfectly competitive markets. It also makes the important assumption that arbitrageurs have access to necessary funds with which to trade when opportunities arise. LOOP is defined as being: 'When trade is open and costless, identical goods must trade at the same relative prices regardless of where they are sold.' Gerard Debreu in 'Theory of Value' defined identical goods as those being in identical locations, but here we will treat goods as being identical, if as such regardless of location. LOOP: The intuition behind the formula is such that if price differences did exist, then arbitrageurs would buy large quantities of the product in the relatively cheaper country and sell it in the more expensive country at a profit. Absolute PPP is the point such that the 'Exchange Rate between country's currencies equals the ratios of the country's price levels.' P = eP The intuition is the same as for LOOP. Relative PPP is when the percentage change in exchange rates between country's over any period is equal to the difference between the percentage change in national price levels. Relative PPP is a statement about price changes whereas absolute is about price levels. If LOOP holds for every commodity then PPP must hold but LOOP need not hold for PPP validity. There are several problems with these hypotheses. Firstly, there is a problem with absolute PPP which compares national price levels. Price levels are determined by a sum of weighted average prices of a suitably average basket of goods for that country. As consumption patterns are very rarely identical between countries and also that the indexes are not compiled in a standardised way, makes comparisons between indexes biased and inaccurate. For example, Norway will place more weight on the price of whale meat than Italy would as more of it is traded in Norway. This is why relative PPP is so useful as it measures changes, not actual prices. Secondly, the assumption that there are no barriers to trade such as tariffs and that there are no transport costs are unrealistic. Within the EU and other such economic groups, there are no barriers to trade, but outside of these geographical areas, protectionism is increasing. This distorts prices and can prevent arbitrage if there are quotas. There have been several suggested solutions to transport costs. The first is that output is split into categories: tradable goods, such as raw materials and manufactured goods, for example a car and agricultural products; and nontradeable goods, those goods, for example a haircut where transport costs are so large relative to the cost of producing some goods and services that they can never be traded internationally at a profit. An alternative view regarding transport or trade costs is that they may be linearly related to the value of the product, as suggested in the Iceberg model and hence is like an ad valorem tax and is in proportion to the product value. This would have no impact on relative PPP, but unfortunately, it is rarely the be negligible, prices of these products will be lower. PPP and LOOP have important implications in Open Macroeconomics. PPP forms a key assumption in theories such as the Monetary Approach to Exchange Rates, which when combined with the Fisher equation, has important implications. The Monetary approach assumes perfectly flexible markets and outputs. It assumes that the Foreign Exchange markets set the Exchange rates such that PPP holds. Exchange rates are fully determined in the long run by the relative supplies and demands for money such that Md = as well as PPP, the end result is that of 'PPP in expectations': has important implications when trying to test PPP empirically as all the variables are unobservable. Here I bring in the concept of the real exchange rate, RER, defined algebraically as. In the appendices, the concluding result that the RER must equal and cannot change if PPP is to hold is derived. If foreign prices rise more quickly, it will be exactly offset by a change in the price ratio. However, the RER may deviate from if there is a change in world output markets. An increase world relative demand for domestic output would cause the domestic currency to appreciate. If domestic output increases relative to world output, we would see a long run depreciation of the currency. Overall, we can say that when there are only monetary effects in the economy, exchange rates obey relative PPP in the long run as set out in the Monetary model. However, changes in the output market will have an effect which is not in line with PPP. The Dornbusch model was an attempt to explain why exchange rates are far more volatile than predicted in the Monetary approach. It combines the concept of short-term sticky prices with the long-term results of the Monetary approach. It also contrasts in that it does not assume that PPP holds but does forecast UIRP to hold at all times. It predicts the exchange rate to make short term deviations from its equilibrium. Empirically, the model fails badly. First Generation Currency Crises show how any country with a fixed or pegged exchange rate and that has an increasing money suffer a currency crisis whereby its foreign exchange reserves become empty. PPP determines the 'shadow' exchange rate through the monetary approach which will be the exchange rate to replace the fixed regime once it collapses. The empirical evidence found in support of LOOP and PPP is rather poor; all versions do badly. Absolute PPP, as identified earlier, is expected to do poorly empirically due to different goods baskets used across countries to compile their national price levels. Initial research through the 970's showed no relationships to support either hypothesis. Isard's research into LOOP in 977 found evidence of substantial deviations on the basis of regression analysis for the equation pi s = a bpi u. For LOOP to hold, the null hypothesis was such that H0:a =,b = but these were not the results he obtained. Deviations from PPP are predicted in the Dornbusch model due to the price-stickiness in the short term and the monetary approach is a long-term view. Hence, economists are suffering from an insufficient data period as the deviations may last many years. Most researchers now believe that the half-life of deviations from PPP are between. and years depending on the currencies, the price indexes and the sample period which can be tested by Dickey Fuller Unit root tests. Michael Mussa came to the conclusion that floating exchange rates lead to much larger and more frequent short run deviations from relative PPP, due to the freedom of capital flows. A cause of possible LOOP failure identified earlier was that of transport costs. In the last decade, researchers have found much evidence to support this. Once the price deviations are higher than the transport costs (arbitrage costs), then prices will revert to the mean, by which the adjustment process is known as the 'Threshold Autoregressive Model.' This expects a band of transactions costs which result in no adjustments in deviations towards LOOP. One study looked at overcoming the transport cost to see if it was the only variable causing PPP to fail. The Engel and Rogers study looked at the price volatility for a range of goods in many American and Canadian cities The resulting conclusion was that 'The distance between cities explained a significant amount of the variation in the prices of similar goods in different cities, but the variation of the price was much higher for two cities located in different countries than for two equidistant cities in the same country', pointing to a Border Effect. In conclusion, LOOP and PPP fail to hold in the short fun but in the very long run, there is some support but with a very slow speed of convergence which would take many years to revert to.""","""Exchange Rate Theories and Models""","1590","""Exchange Rate Theories and Models play a crucial role in understanding the complexities of international trade and finance. These theories and models provide a framework for economists, policymakers, and investors to analyze and predict the fluctuations in exchange rates between different currencies. By studying exchange rate theories and models, professionals can gain insights into the factors influencing exchange rate movements and make informed decisions in the global marketplace.  One of the fundamental theories used to explain exchange rate movements is the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory. According to PPP, in the long run, exchange rates between two countries should adjust to equalize the prices of a basket of goods and services. The theory suggests that if the relative prices of goods in two countries are different, the exchange rate should adjust to reflect these differences and restore equilibrium. The PPP theory comes in two forms: the Absolute PPP which assumes that prices are equalized, and the Relative PPP which accounts for the changes in price levels over time.  Another prominent theory is the Interest Rate Parity (IRP) theory, which states that the difference in interest rates between two countries should be equal to the expected change in the exchange rate. In other words, under IRP, an investor should not be able to make a risk-free profit by borrowing in a low-interest rate currency, converting it to a high-interest rate currency, and investing at the higher rate. The IRP theory is essential for understanding how interest rate differentials can impact exchange rates in the short term.  Moving beyond theories, various models have been developed to quantitatively analyze exchange rate movements. The Mundell-Fleming model, for instance, combines elements of the PPP and IRP theories with the analysis of fiscal and monetary policies' impact on exchange rates. This model helps policymakers understand the dynamics between exchange rates, interest rates, and government policies in an open economy. By using the Mundell-Fleming model, countries can assess the implications of their policy decisions on exchange rate stability and international competitiveness.  Another widely used model is the Asset Market model, which focuses on the supply and demand for financial assets denominated in different currencies. This model considers factors such as interest rate differentials, expectations about future exchange rate movements, and risk perceptions to determine how assets are allocated across currencies. The Asset Market model offers insights into the role of speculators, investors, and central banks in shaping exchange rate dynamics based on their beliefs and strategies.  In addition to these models, the Dornbusch Overshooting model provides a framework for explaining short-term exchange rate volatility following economic shocks. This model suggests that exchange rates can overshoot their long-run equilibrium levels in response to changes in expectations, monetary policies, or external factors. The Dornbusch Overshooting model highlights the importance of considering investors' reactions to new information and the time it takes for markets to reach a new equilibrium after a shock.  Moreover, the Exchange Rate Expectations model focuses on how market participants form their expectations about future exchange rate movements. This model incorporates factors such as economic indicators, central bank policies, geopolitical events, and sentiment to predict how exchange rates are likely to evolve. By understanding and analyzing these expectations, investors can make better-informed decisions about currency trading, hedging, and international investments.  Furthermore, the Portfolio Balance model emphasizes the role of portfolio diversification in influencing exchange rates. This model suggests that investors allocate their portfolios across different assets based on risk-return considerations, leading to changes in the demand for currencies. By examining how changes in interest rates, inflation expectations, and risk preferences affect portfolio choices, economists can evaluate the impact on exchange rates and capital flows in the global economy.  Overall, Exchange Rate Theories and Models provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of currency markets and international finance. By combining theoretical frameworks with quantitative models, economists and analysts can better understand the factors driving exchange rate movements and make informed predictions about future trends. These theories and models serve as essential tools for policymakers, investors, and businesses seeking to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the interconnected global economy.""","807"

Programming a robot involves providing instructions to perform specific tasks, while execution is the actual implementation of these instructions. This intricate process requires a combination of technical expertise, precision, and thorough planning to ensure seamless operation and efficiency in robotic systems.  In robot programming, developers utilize specialized software tools to create programs that dictate the robot's movements, actions, and interactions with its environment. These programs can be written using different programming languages depending on the complexity of the task and the type of robot being used. Common programming languages for robotics include Python, C++, and ROS (Robot Operating System), each offering unique features and capabilities to control robots effectively.  The programming process typically involves defining the robot's kinematics, dynamics, and sensors to enable it to navigate its surroundings, manipulate objects, and perform designated tasks. This entails understanding the robot's mechanical structure, range of motion, and sensor inputs to develop accurate and efficient programs. Programmers also need to consider safety protocols, error handling, and real-time responsiveness to ensure the robot operates reliably in various scenarios.  Once the programs are created, they are usually transferred to the robot's controller or onboard computer for execution. The execution phase involves running the programs to translate the coded instructions into physical movements and actions. During execution, the robot interprets the program commands, processes sensor inputs, and interacts with its environment to carry out the intended tasks with precision and accuracy.  Robots can be programmed to perform a wide range of functions, including pick-and-place operations, welding, painting, assembly, and inspection tasks. The complexity of the programming and execution process varies depending on the specific application and industry requirements. For instance, industrial robots used in manufacturing environments often require intricate programming to optimize production processes and meet quality standards.  In addition to offline programming, where programs are created and tested in a simulated environment before deployment, real-time programming allows for on-the-fly adjustments and adaptations based on changing conditions. This flexibility is crucial in dynamic environments where robots need to respond to unforeseen obstacles or variations in tasks.  During the execution phase, monitoring and feedback mechanisms play a vital role in ensuring the robot operates efficiently and safely. Real-time monitoring of sensor data, actuators, and performance metrics enables operators to track the robot's progress, identify any deviations from the programmed behavior, and intervene if necessary to prevent errors or malfunctions.  Moreover, advancements in robotics technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, have enabled robots to learn and adapt to new situations autonomously. This self-learning capability allows robots to continuously improve their performance based on feedback and experience, enhancing their efficiency and productivity in various applications.  Overall, the programming and execution process in robotics is a meticulous and iterative task that requires expertise, precision, and continuous refinement to optimize the performance of robots in diverse industries. By mastering this process, engineers and developers can unleash the full potential of robots to revolutionize automation, enhance productivity, and drive innovation across sectors.""","603"
"86","""Pepper v Hart - The taxpayers were teachers at Malvern College who could educate their sons at the school at one-fifth the normal fees. The question raised was the precise amount of tax to be paid for the benefit received. The Court of Appeal held the cost for the employer, i.e., school was the average cost and gave a ruling in favour of the school; and the House of Lords reversed the opinion deciding in favour of the taxpayers i.e., the cost of benefit was the marginal cost; and for doing this it relied on parliamentary debates, or Hansard. The ratio laid down in the case was reference to Hansard would be permitted only under the following circumstances: where there is an ambiguity or obscurity as to the meaning of the legislation or when the literal meaning leads to absurdity; and the statement is the statement of a minister or other promoter of the bill; and the statement relied is clear. Pepper v Hart AC 93 @ 40 The importance of the case lies in that, the court had to decide if they could have recourse to Hansard in deciding a case, and if did, would it infringe Art. of the Bill of from Church of Scientology of California v Johnson - Smith QB 22 @ 23 Hansard is defined as 'The name by which the Official Report of Parliamentary Debates is customarily referred to'. It is not the understanding of the individual Members of Parliament on the present state of law of, but the words, which provide evidence of the purpose of the legislation. It is one of the extrinsic aids to statutory interpretation, now widely considered after this famous decision. Oxford Dictionary of Law, Fourth Edition 997, Oxford University Press, Pg 10 APPROACHES TO STATUTORY INTERPRETATIONStatutory interpretation is the process by which the courts attach meaning to a particular statute in a case before it. There are three rules of statutory interpretation: - Literal Rule - The courts uses the actual words in the statute and gives meaning to it irrespective of the result produced. Golden Rule - The courts construes the statute as a whole to give effect to the legislation. This can be used only if literal meaning leads to absurdity. Mischief Rule - If there is any mischief in the common law, which the statute intended to remedy, the courts will give effect to it. Though they are referred to as rules, they are only guiding principles. And they have to be used in the order of priority. There are two approaches to interpretation: Literal Approach - This approach suggests, the judge, unless under rare circumstances, should use only the words of the statute to give meaning to it. Purposive Approach - This approach suggests the judge can look at words outside the statute to give effect to the true intention of the legislature. The English Law is said to use the literal approach to interpretation. But now, for matters concerning the European and also the domestic legislation designed to implement Community legislation purposive approach is adopted. The English Legal System, Slapper & Kelly, Seventh Edition 004, Pg 93 - 94. USE OF HANSARD The courts never permitted using Hansard as an aid to interpretation until the 990s as it was thought to be unreliable. In the case of Davis v Johnson, Lord Denning MR, wanted to change this and dissented the view that parliamentary material should not be used and said it would throw light on the matter if used. AC 64 But when the case went before the House of Lords Lord Scarman reversed the judgement and said that use of parliamentary material did not promote clarity and was unreliable and hence not to be used. This was the position on until the decision in Pepper v Hart, which allowed reference to Hansard as an aid to interpretation. The House of Lords reversed its earlier decisions in Beswick v Beswick, Black-Clawson v Papierwerke Waldohf-Aschaffenburg AG, and Davis v Johnson. AC 93 AC 8 AC 91 AC 64 Lord Browne- Wilkinson, delivering the leading judgement in the case said: 'I suspect most, cases references to Parliamentary materials will not throw any light on the matter. But in a few cases it may emerge that the very question was considered by Parliament in passing the legislation. Why in such a case should the courts blind themselves to a clear indication of what Parliament intended in using those words?' Hart and Related Appeals AC 96 @ 34 - This suggests that in case of any ambiguity, instead of giving a wrong interpretation of Parliamentary intention, the court can have recourse to parliamentary debates. The courts have, after all to give effect to the Parliament's intention. But this has to be construed very strictly and used only in the cases set out above and when the other internal aids fail to give meaning. ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE USE OF HANSARDBut there is one major drawback of the use of Hansard addressed by almost all the judges and other critics time and again, which is that the use of Hansard greatly increases the cost of litigation. While I accede to this view I feel that since parliamentary materials are to be used only in limited cases as set out in the decision it will not lead to increased costs in all cases. But this is not always true as can be seen from a multitude of cases where lawyers have tried to use Hansard but in vain. There are cases where Hansard was used even when there was no ambiguity in construing the statute. 'Pepper v Hart A Re-examination', Steyn, Johan 1 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, 001, pg 9 @ 3 - 4 R v Warwickshire County Council, Ex Parte Johnson AC 83 Another drawback, as argued by the commentators is that by using the words of the ministers, they may get the power to make laws. This goes against the separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary. It is also thought of as encroaching upon the judicial functions. 'Pepper v Hart and its Constitutional Principle', Kavanagh, Aileen, Law Quarterly Review 005/8 @ 02 USE OF HANSARD AFTER PEPPER V HARTThe cases where Hansard was used were Warwickshire County Council, Ex Parte Johnson, a case that came before the House of Lords immediately after Pepper v Hart. But there were cases where Hansard could not be used since they did not satisfy the requirements. AC 83 AC 93 R v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the WLR Three Rivers District Council v Bank of was held that the rule on Hansard must be relaxed in order to give effect to some particular EC Directive. Held, it could be used to determine the purpose of the statute. Similarly, in the case of Wilson v First County Trust, HL considered for the first time if parliamentary material could be used to ascertain if a statutory provision was compatible with the ECHR. But it was held that it was not appropriate for the court to use Hansard here. All ER All ER 7 European Convention on Human Rights CONCLUSIONIn conclusion I submit that though Hansard as an aid to interpretation has proven itself useful, in most cases a plain reading of the statute will suffice. Another important aspect to be noted is the ministers have to now take greater care to see that what they say reflects the purpose of the Act and this involves greater time and money for the Parliament since it has to look at all the notes and see to it that it does not include unnecessary material since the court may rely upon these in future. Not only this, the use of Hansard may not prove to be useful; and in many, in fact most occasions the courts have refused to use it since it does not shed any light on the matter.""","""Pepper v Hart case and interpretation""","1567","""Pepper v Hart, a landmark case in UK legal history, fundamentally changed the approach to statutory interpretation. This case, heard in 1992 by the House of Lords, dealt with the interpretation of tax legislation and the use of Parliamentary materials in understanding Acts of Parliament. The implications of Pepper v Hart reach far beyond tax law, significantly influencing the interpretation of legislation across various legal fields. As we delve into the intricacies of this case and its broader impact, it becomes evident that Pepper v Hart stands as a pivotal moment in shaping the relationship between statutes and legislative intent.  At the heart of the Pepper v Hart case was the concept of using parliamentary materials, such as debates and reports, to aid in understanding the meaning of statutory provisions. The House of Lords grappled with the question of whether it was permissible to refer to such materials when faced with ambiguity or uncertainty in interpreting legislation. The traditional rule of statutory interpretation, the """"literal rule,"""" dictated that judges should strictly adhere to the wording of the statute, without considering external sources like parliamentary debates.  However, in Pepper v Hart, the House of Lords departed from this strict approach and allowed the use of Parliamentary materials as an interpretative tool under certain circumstances. Lord Browne-Wilkinson's judgment emphasized that when statutory language is ambiguous or leads to absurdity, resorting to parliamentary materials can provide clarity on the legislative intent behind the statute. This marked a significant shift towards a more purposive approach to statutory interpretation, aiming to discern and give effect to the intention of Parliament.  The decision in Pepper v Hart has had profound implications for legal practice and the judicial understanding of legislation. It introduced the concept of """"legislative history,"""" where courts could look beyond the text of the statute to discern the intention of Parliament. This approach acknowledges that statutes are not created in a vacuum but are the result of a deliberative process involving debates, committee reports, and other parliamentary materials that shed light on the context and purpose of the law.  By allowing the use of parliamentary materials, Pepper v Hart opened the door to a more nuanced and contextually informed interpretation of statutes. This approach recognizes that statutory language may not always capture the full scope of legislative intent and that external sources can offer valuable insights into the purpose behind the law. Consequently, judges have greater flexibility to consider the broader context in which legislation was enacted, ensuring that the law is applied in a manner consistent with Parliament's intentions.  The impact of Pepper v Hart extends beyond the realm of tax law to influence statutory interpretation in various legal contexts. Courts have cited this case in decisions involving complex legislation where textual analysis alone may not yield a clear answer. The principle established in Pepper v Hart underscores the importance of understanding the underlying purpose and policy objectives of legislation, guiding judges in their efforts to give effect to the will of Parliament.  Despite its significance, Pepper v Hart has not completely upended the traditional rules of statutory interpretation. The use of parliamentary materials remains a supplementary tool rather than a primary method of interpretation. Courts must still prioritize the statutory text and resort to external sources only when necessary to resolve ambiguity or absurdity. This cautious approach ensures that the legislative process retains its primacy, with judicial interpretation serving as a means to uphold legislative intent rather than override it.  In conclusion, Pepper v Hart represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of statutory interpretation, challenging the strict confines of the literal rule and embracing a more purposive approach guided by legislative intent. By recognizing the value of parliamentary materials in understanding statutes, the case has enriched the interpretative toolkit available to judges and reinforced the importance of context in applying the law. As a seminal decision with far-reaching consequences, Pepper v Hart continues to shape the practice of statutory interpretation and uphold the principle of giving effect to the will of Parliament in the UK legal system.""","758"
"6079","""Genetically is food that has had genes, not normally present, added to it. Genes are transferred from one organism to another via modified strains of viruses and bacteria. Some of the reasons given for genetic modification include delayed ripening, decreased allergens, crops that are more resistant to climate extremes or disease, altering the nutrient content of foods and increasing the efficiency of food production systems. A key reason for genetic engineering is to make production cheaper and easier. There are also many negative consequences and risks to take in to account; such as loss of biodiversity, risk to human health, increased power of giant biotech firms, contamination of crops through cross-pollination and the potential for 'super weeds', which would be pest resistant. For these reasons genetic modification is a highly controversial topic. The attitude of individual consumers is influenced by their perceptions of the benefits and risks posed by GM foods, levels of risk aversion, knowledge of science, views about government and corporations as well as their moral and ethical views. Consumers are constantly being influenced by sources such as newspapers and television programs, which are not always reliable but add to ones paradigms. That said; a study carried out by the University of Manchester found that the only source of GM information, which over 0% of respondents said they would 'definitely trust', was universities/educational organisations. The government was widely distrusted in the field of GM technology. The study also found considerable variation in preferences in terms of class, age, gender, attitudes and the presence of children in the household. Studies have also found that socio-economic factors do not have a major influence on consumer choice regarding GM produce. It is very hard for consumers to become adequately informed on the topic of genetic modification from non-biased sources, which would enable them to form their own informed judgement on the matter. With that in mind, this essay aims to compare the attitude towards GM food of the majority of consumers in Europe with the USA. Products containing genetically modified ingredients first appeared on shelves in the UK in 997. This new technology was not well received as was shown by over 0 crop destructions, protests and rallies in the UK 999. The most high profile of these events, which Lord Melchett; the then head of Greenpeace played a part in, was the destruction of herbicide-tolerant maize belonging to the biotechnology company AgrEvo. Subsequently UK food retailers began removing GM foods and ingredients from their supply chain. A national survey, conducted by the Food Standards the UK in 003 concluded that around 0% of consumers were against GM crops and only % would eat GM foods. However another survey carried out by the FSA in 002 showed a decrease in public concern over the previous years. Similar resistance has been observed throughout Europe. One survey found that 0% of the European public are against GM food. Due to the success of the anti-GM movement no GM crops are currently grown commercially in the UK. However, food made from or containing GM products grown on sale in the UK, and many more GM products are awaiting EU approval. Europe has imposed restrictive regulations on GM crops in any portion of the food chain, and any food or drink products in the UK will be labelled as containing GM Soya or corn protein. It has been found that the main consumer concern to do with GM crops is the potential risk to the environment, although there is still a lot of worry regarding the safety of GM food. These concerns could well be justified. According to Dr. Mae-Wan Ho from the Institute of Science in Society there is a serious risk of horizontal gene transfer and there is enough evidence to indicate that it's possible for transgenic DNA in GM crops and products to be spread by viruses and bacteria as well as by plant and animal cells. Horizontal gene transfer poses many health risks. These include the spread of antibiotic resistant genes to pathogenic bacteria, the creation of new viruses and disease causing bacteria and the transfer of transgenic DNA into human cells, causing cancer. As an example of negative consequences, E.coli is a normally harmless bacterium, which has commonly been used for gene transfer, but modified strains have managed to escape from laboratories. E.coli 15/87:H7, which can be fatal, was first detected in the US in 982. In 002 there were 084 reported cases in the UK. Meat and raw milk are the most common sources of infection. Furthermore, the New Scientist reported an environmental crisis in Argentina where Soya has damaged soil bacteria and allowed herbicide-resistant weeds to grow out of control. The four main producers of GM crops are the US, Argentina, Canada and China. The crops being commercially grown include pest-resistant maize and cotton, and Soya resistant to weed killer. In contrast to Europe, the US is a large producer of GM crops and is also pressurising other trading countries to accept GM too. According to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), biotechnology plantings as a percentage of total crop plantings in the United States in 004 were about 6 percent for corn, 6 percent for cotton, and 5/8 percent for soybeans. Estimates also predict that 0 - 0% of processed food products on American store shelves contain some trace from GM crops. Nevertheless, despite agricultural technology being so widespread in the USA, public acceptance is still very mixed and genetically modified food remains a topic that the average American consumer has very little knowledge of. There is a low awareness of biotechnology in general amongst Americans, as was shown by a national study carried out by the Food Policy Institute, Rutgers University of New Jersey, in late 003. This survey claims that only half of Americans are aware that foods containing GM ingredients are currently sold in stores. When asked directly, about half of Americans reported that they approve plant based GM foods, and about a quarter approve of animal-based GM foods. The study also found that opinions of GM foods could be easily influenced. Approval increased when specific benefits of GM food were mentioned. A study by Benjamin Onyango, a research associate at the Food Policy Institute found that male, white, southerners and those with some college education are more likely to consume genetically modified fruit and vegetables. He found that once the respondents were well informed of the risks of the product, their willingness to consume such products greatly diminished. This supports the claim that their opinions could be easily influenced. The Food Policy Institute study found the stance of Americans on labelling of GM foods to be unclear. When asked directly 4% agreed that GM ingredients should be labelled as such, however before GM was mentioned less than % mentioned GM ingredients as something they would wish to appear on labels. It is not currently law for food products in the USA to be labelled as containing genetically modified ingredients. However, at the next session of the Codex Committee on Food Labelling (Ottawa, Canada, on May -, 006), the Committee will be discussing 'proposed Draft Guidelines for the Labelling of Foods and Food Ingredients obtained through Certain Techniques of Genetic Modification/Genetic Engineering.' URL In conclusion, there is a large difference between the attitude towards genetic modification in Europe and the USA. Of all countries, consumers in North America are among the most willing to accept GM produce, whereas consumers in Europe hold the most concerns. However many Americans still harbour concerns and consumer attitude is critical to the acceptance of a new technology. This is shown by the refusal of major food companies Mc Donald's and Frito-Lays to the use of GM potatoes. Nevertheless, it is important to analyse which of these concerns are real, and which are perceived. Consumer concerns should not be simply dismissed as false perceptions due to their lack of understanding. Rather, the concerns should be acknowledged; and unbiased information regarding the technology should be made readily available in order to enable the consumers to form better judgements. It should be the consumers right to have access to this information. Consumer acceptance of GM foods is critical to the future development of this technology.""","""Genetically Modified Foods and Controversy""","1625","""Genetically modified foods, often referred to as GM foods or GMOs (genetically modified organisms), have sparked significant controversy and debate in recent years. These foods are produced from crops whose genetic material has been altered through genetic engineering techniques. While the development of genetically modified foods has the potential to address global issues such as food security, crop yield improvement, and disease resistance, it also raises concerns about food safety, environmental impact, and ethical considerations.  One of the primary arguments in favor of genetically modified foods is their ability to increase crop yield and quality. By introducing genetic modifications that enhance traits such as pest resistance, drought tolerance, and nutritional content, scientists and agricultural experts aim to produce more resilient and nutritious crops. This can be particularly beneficial in regions prone to crop failures due to environmental factors or pests, leading to improved food security and economic stability for farmers and communities.  Another key benefit of genetically modified foods is their potential to reduce the need for chemical pesticides and herbicides. Crops engineered for pest resistance can lower the reliance on harmful chemicals, thus decreasing environmental pollution and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Additionally, genetically modified crops are designed to withstand harsh growing conditions, such as drought or extreme temperatures, which can help farmers mitigate risks associated with climate change and unpredictable weather patterns.  Despite these potential advantages, genetically modified foods have faced significant opposition, with critics raising several concerns about their safety and impact on human health. One major point of contention is the lack of long-term studies evaluating the health effects of consuming genetically modified organisms. While regulatory agencies such as the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) assess the safety of GMOs before they enter the market, some scientists and consumer advocacy groups argue that more comprehensive research is needed to fully understand the potential risks associated with genetically modified foods.  The environmental impact of genetically modified foods is another contentious issue. Critics argue that the cultivation of GM crops can lead to unintended consequences, such as the development of herbicide-resistant weeds or the harm to beneficial insects and biodiversity. There are also concerns about the potential for genetic contamination of non-GMO crops, which could pose challenges for organic farmers and seed purity.  Ethical considerations surrounding genetic modification in agriculture have also contributed to the controversy. Critics raise questions about the ownership and control of genetically modified seeds by biotechnology companies, which can restrict farmers' independence and perpetuate dependence on specific seed varieties. There are also concerns about the equitable distribution of benefits from GM crops, particularly in developing countries where small-scale farmers may face challenges accessing and affording genetically modified seeds.  In response to the growing debate surrounding genetically modified foods, some countries have implemented regulations to label GMO products or restrict their cultivation. These measures aim to provide consumers with transparency regarding the presence of genetically modified ingredients in food products and to allow individuals to make informed choices about what they eat. However, the varying approaches to GMO regulation globally have resulted in a complex landscape of policies and practices, leading to ongoing discussions about the role of genetically modified foods in the food system.  Research continues to explore the potential benefits and risks of genetically modified foods, with ongoing developments in genetic engineering techniques and biotechnology. As technology advances, the debate around genetically modified foods is likely to persist, shaping the future of agriculture, food production, and consumer preferences. Finding a balance between innovation, safety, sustainability, and ethical considerations will be crucial in navigating the complexities of genetically modified foods and addressing the diverse perspectives on this controversial topic.""","682"
"364","""Renold Plc is a multi-national precision engineering group producing amongst others industrial chains and related power transmission systems. Like all limited companies Renold Plc is required to produce an annual financial report that provides a 'true and fair view' of the company's performance. In the case of Renold Plc the report produced complies with this belief, in the opinion of the Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the financial report provides a 'true and fair view' along with complying with all the relevant financial accounting standards such as those within the 985/8 Companies Act. The implementation of the International Accounting Standards will mean there is an improvement in the stated profit before tax for the 004/005/8 annual financial report and this will affect the next financial report in several ways. A variety of performance indictors can be used to evaluate the performance of Renold Plc over the past financial years along with an insight into the possible future performance. From the 004/005/8 annual financial report it is clearly seen that the company had a difficult year mainly due to the increase in steel prices of approximately 0% and the weakness of the United States Dollar. The future prospects for the company outlined in the narrative of the annual financial report 005/8 and the interim report published 2 th December 005/8 show that there could be an increase in performance of the company over the next financial year and it is suggested that ordinary shareholders keep hold of their shares over the next financial year.Assessment questionAll limited companies have to produce an annual financial report. Does this annual financial report provide a 'true and fair view' of the company's performance? How reliable is this report to an ordinary shareholder as an indicator of both past and future performance? To evaluate the performance of Renold Plc over the past financial year it is necessary to consider a selection of performance indicators, these are selected to show the overall performance of Renold Plc. These indictors consist of ratios calculated from data contained within the annual financial report 005/8 and the FAME database, along with other indicators such as turnover, share price and peer analysis. These indicators will demonstrate the past performance of Renold Plc and give an insight into the possible performance in the next financial year. From this a recommendation to an ordinary shareholder can be made whether they should sell their shares, hold them or buy more shares. The indicators chosen are listed below: Peer analysisTurnover Return on shareholders' fundsNet profit ratioShare priceAcid test ratioDividend yieldEarnings per shareTrade creditor collection periodPerformance compared to exchange rate and steel pricesFor the report to provide a 'true and fair view' the annual financial report needs to comply with the relevant financial accounting standards, which will be transferred to International Accounting Standards after the publication of the 005/8 annual financial report. A series of accounting adjustments are applied to the financial report and these need to be considered and their impact on the reported profit in order to decide the reliability of the annual report. Analysis and discussionsAn important indictor of the performance of Renold Plc over the past financial year is to compare it to that of its peers. The peer group report according to are not necessary Renold Plc direct competitors. From Table it is possible to see that Renold Plc was placed forth within the peer report according to turnover. Graph illustrates that the turnover for Renold within the upper quartile of the peer group, which could indicate that the company is performing well. It is although hard to compare companies within the peer group directly as the financial year ends are different for each company so the market forces, such as steel price, may not have affected the other companies when they produced their last financial report from which the data for the FAME peer report is taken. The turnover for Renold Plc over the past years as shown in graph decreased since 001, but increased slightly since 003 to a turnover of 97million during the past financial year. Considering the upward trend for turnover over the past years it suggests that Renold Plc could potential increase the turnover once again next financial year. This initial peer review is simplistic as it singularly considers turnover as a comparative, to discover the performance of Renold Plc compared to its peers it would be necessary to consider other performance indications. Table shows that Renold Plc had a profit before taxation of -,00,00 which is ranked twentieth out of the twenty-one companies considered within the peer report. This shows that out of this group Renold Plc made a large loss before taxation. As the peer report considers similar companies, not necessary competitors, the increases in steel prices that affected Renold Plc during the last financial year may not have affected them to such an extent therefore these companies may have made a profit before taxation. Within the FAME peer report for Renold Plc there are a large number of various performance indictors that can be used to compare the companies within the report. The last peer report indictor that will be considered here will be the Return on Shareholders Funds. The definition from J. R. Dyson is that return on shareholders funds is a measure of pre-tax profit against what the shareholders have invested in the entity. This performance indictor is extremely useful as it shows how profitable the entity is as an entirety and represents the efficiency that capital is being utilised within the entity to generate revenue. From Graph it can be seen that Renold Plc has had a difficult financial year during 004/005/8 with a negative return on shareholders funds. J. R. Dyson, 'Accounting for Non-Accounting Students', Sixth Edition, Prentice Hall, 004, p25/84 Using the FAME peer evaluate the return on shareholders funds of Renold Plc compared to the other 8 that the company had a non-profitable year during the last financial year. The group profit and loss account within the annual financial report for 005/8 of Renold Plc states that the company made a loss before tax of. million. Within the narrative section of the annual financial report various reasons are explained for the performance of the company. Robert Davies, Chief Executive explains that commodity prices, in particular the price of steel, along with exchange rate movements have caused significant increases in input costs within the entity. 'Renold Plc, Annual Financial Report 005/8', p6, Renold website, available at: URL As the majority of operation of Renold Plc requires steel for manufacture of various components especially within the power transmission - gears and chains division, the increases in steel prices globally affected the company greatly. Graph illustrates the large increase in global steel prices during the first half of the year. Roger Leverton, Chairman, explains that the increase in steel prices had a major effect in the second half of the year; there was an average increase in costs of approximately 0% within the Group. 'Renold Plc, Annual Financial Report 005/8', p5/8, Renold website, available at: URL The increase in steel prices has meant that the profit for the company over the past financial year has been negative. Although the company has increased sales over the last financial year it has found it hard to recover the costs, particularly from original equipment manufacturers. Looking ahead from the end of the last financial year, 1 st March 005/8, the global steel prices have decreased and are those at the start of the last financial year before the increase, but these steel prices are still significantly higher than the prices during is a good sign for shareholders. The trend of increasing share price is extremely beneficial to shareholders as if they require to sell their shares they will get a higher price than they would have at the end of the previous financial year. It is also important to consider the liquidation state of Renold Plc. The acid test ratio is a liquidity ratio; which according to J.R Dyson measures the extent to which assets can be quickly turned into cash. The acid test ratio takes into consideration that it is perhaps difficult to dispose of stocks quickly and is therefore a good indicator of the entity's liquidation position. A ratio of: means that the company is using its assets effectively and is able to meet its short term debts. As shown in graph 0 the acid test ratio for Renold Plc has increased over the past years and tended towards. This suggests that Renold Plc has enough cash available to cover its' current liabilities if necessary. J. R. Dyson, 'Accounting for Non-Accounting Students', Sixth Edition, Prentice Hall, 004, p25/86 The acid test is a beneficial value for share holders to consider as it shows that Renold Plc has enough funds to pay off current liabilities which is beneficial to the company and indicates that the company will not be going into immediate liquidation. Over the next financial year, Renold Plc needs to ensure that the acid test ratio continues to have a value around., which demonstrates that it is using its resources effectively. Shareholders will be particularly interested in the dividend yield of Renold Plc, as according to Jones the dividend yield ratio shows how much dividend an ordinary share earns as a proportion of their market price. This ratio is a good indication of how Renold believes it is performing. If the entity believes that it is not performing well then it will not pay out dividends or they will be small. Roger Leverton, Chairman, states that there will be no final dividend payout for the 004/005/8 financial year, so the interim dividend of. pence per share will be the total dividend paid for the year. This is not favourable for the shareholders as they are getting a low dividend yield for their investment. M. Jones, 'Accounting for Non-Specialists', Sixth Edition, First Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 002, p196 Graph 1 shows that there has been a steady decrease in the dividend yield ratio for Renold over the past years. The decreasing towards a low dividend yield could have occurred if the share price had risen in value considerably and the paid dividends remained constant. This is not the case for Renold Plc as from graph; the share price has in fact decreased over the past financial year. To complete the analysis of investment ratios of Renold Plc the earnings per share will also be considered along with the investment ratio of dividend yield as discussed above. This ratio puts the profit of the company in context by relating it to the number of shares in use. The fluctuating behaviour of Renold Plc is un-beneficial for shareholders as they would prefer to see a growth in earnings per share over the past it is likely to win more contracts. The company is currently establishing a wholly owned manufacturing facility in China, which will open up the market in the Far East. Also establishing a manufacturing facility in Tennessee in December 004 will reduce the exposure to the exchange rate fluctuations by producing all Cam Drive Systems for Dollar based economies. The interim results for the half year ended 0 th September 005/8 for Renold Plc were released on 2 th December 005/8 and were in line with the expectations of the Board. The interim turnover had increased by 2% from 5/8. million in 004 to 06. million in 005/8. Roger Leverton, Chairman, said 'with the order book substantially higher than at the commencement of the year, and with the actions taken to mitigate cost increases, the second half performance should see an improvement. ' But if there was an increase in the cost of raw materials or fuel this could significantly influence the profit of the company in the second half of the current financial year. The interim report does show that Renold Plc has made a pre-tax loss before tax and exceptional items of. million, and has therefore decided not to pay an interim dividend to shareholders. FACTIVA- 'Renold Plc, Interim Report 005/8' available from FACTIVA website: URL When considering the past performance of Renold Plc it was compared to its' FAME peer group. The Interim Report for the highest ranked is available and shows a profit before tax of $6. million up 12% from $8. million in is considered in the same peer group as Renold Plc as it is a similar company. Wood Group are an engineering design and project management services company so are not direct competitors to Renold Plc, but it is still useful to compare the interim reports as it shows that a peer to Renold is able to make a profit within the current market conditions. ConclusionEffect of AdjustmentsAll limited companies are required to produce an annual financial report that provides a 'true and fair view' of the company's performance. Within the Annual Report several accounting adjustments are made which can affect the reported profit within the report. One such adjustment that is made within the annual financial report is to the tangible assets, the report explains that, where appropriate, adjustments are made to the remaining effective usefulness of the lives of the assets. These should be in-line with the circumstances, by could be adjusted to provide a larger value for the tangible assets by increasing the period of time it takes for the item to depreciate. In-turn this will show the profit for this year to be higher than the actual value. If the accounts are to give a true and fair view of the performance of Renold, the adjustments made should be in-line with the circumstances and provide an accurate picture of the performance of the entity. Renold Plc, Annual Financial Report 005/8', p27, Renold website, available at: URL Financial instruments are also used to perform adjustments on the accounts, to provide a more accurate view of them. It is necessary to make adjustments for the various exchange rates that the company encounters throughout the financial year. The accounting policy notes within the annual report state that the 'amounts payable or receivable in respect of the interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments.' 3 These exchange adjustments are shown in the notes for the accounts of the annual financial report 005/8, for the intangible and tangible assets. Goodwill adjustments have also been made in the annual report concerning the acquisition of Jones & Shipman, and exceptional impairment charge of -. been added to the group profit and loss account. Without this adjustment the retained profit for the year would have been higher than that stated, but would have still been a negative loss. Financial Accounting StandardsBy law companies are required to publish annual financial reports. The 985/8 Companies Act requires all companies to publish profit and loss accounts and a balance sheet; they are also required to disclose the auditors' report, a cash flow statement and a statement of total recognised gains and losses of the company. All five of these requirements are found with the annual financial report. The auditors' report explains that in the opinion of the Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Renold Plc for that financial year. It also states that the accounts are in accordance with the Companies Act 985/8. Although it is not possible for the to find any mistakes within the report, the auditors' report confirms that the relevant financial accounting standards have been applied to produce a true and fair view. I believe the annual financial report 005/8 to be a reliable indicator for Renold Plc, and provide a 'true and fair view' of the performance of the company. Renold Plc, Annual Financial Report 005/8', p26, Renold website, available at: URL Renold Plc is required to move from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and adopt International Accounting Standards. The International Accounting Standards will be first implemented during the Interim Report published 2 th December 005/8. Renold Plc will also restate prior financial information before this date so that comparisons can be made between the various financial years of the company. There will be several changes within the next annual report due to the transference to International Accounting Standards. Some of the basic changes implemented by the International Accounting Standards are the titles of various figures within the report will have to be renamed, and some existing balances will be under different captions, for example Tony that 'Deferred tax assets' will be 'transferred from current assets to deferred tax - non-current assets' Reuters UK website, (as accessed 3/1/6) URL Bibliography C.P. Stickney & R.L. Weil, 'Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses,' Seventh Edition, The Dryden Press,994. C. Nobes,  to Financial Accounting', Forth Edition, Thomson Business Press, 997. A major influence of the implementation of the International Accounting Standards will be on the reinstated result for the year end 1 st March 005/8. 'IFRS requires the immediate recognition of negative goodwill as a credit to the income statement.'5/8 This will mean there is an improvement in the stated profit before tax from a loss of. million to be reinstated on the interim a loss of. million. Under the UK GAAP Renold Plc adopted FRS 7 regarding pensions. When adopting the International Accounting Standards, IAS 9 will replace FRS 7. There are a number of large similarities between the two standards, so the impact on the pension section of the annual financial report will not be as significant as the changes regarding goodwill. Shareholder PositionAs I believe the annual financial report 005/8 to be a 'true and fair view' of the performance of Renold Plc over the past financial year it is possible to make recommendations to an ordinary share holder about the past and future performance of the company based on the 0 performance analysed and discussed above. Looking back to the beginning of the last financial would have advised an ordinary shareholder to sell their shares as the share price decreased during the last financial year. The 003/004 financial year had shown a positive net profit ratio and earnings per share whereas the 004/005/8 financial year had provide negative values for these ratios and the share price is lower than that of the year before. Selling at the beginning of the 004/005/8 financial year would have meant that the shareholder would not have been involved in the difficult Plc had for that financial year. Although the reinstated figures due to the implementation of the International Accounting Standards mean that the return on shareholders funds ratio for the last financial year will not have been such a large negative number if recalculated. At the end of year 1 st March 005/8 I would advise ordinary shareholders to hold their shares as Renold Plc is implementing plenty of measures to counteract the high steel prices, by lowering operating costs and subsequently increasing the net profit. Although the interim report published on 2 th December 005/8 states that no interim dividends will be paid out, it is likely that there will be some final year dividends that can be collected by the shareholders. The share price of Renold Plc is also on an upward trend so if trend continues they will be able to realise the maximum amount from their shares. From the performance indictors analysed above and narrative within the 004/005/8 annual financial report I believe that the performance of Renold Plc will improve over the next financial year.""","""Renold Plc Financial Performance Analysis""","3943","""Renold Plc is a renowned global leader in the manufacturing and supply of industrial chains and related power transmission products.

By examining key financial ratios and trends, we can evaluate the company's performance over the past few years and assess its financial strengths and weaknesses.  **Income Statement Analysis**  The income statement provides a snapshot of Renold Plc's revenues, expenses, and overall profitability. It is essential to evaluate trends in revenue growth, gross margin, operating income, and net income to assess the company's financial performance. Renold Plc's revenue trends over the past few years indicate its ability to generate sales and drive top-line growth. Analyzing the gross margin can reveal the company's pricing power and efficiency in managing production costs. A consistent or improving gross margin suggests effective cost control and pricing strategies, contributing to profitability. Meanwhile, operating income and net income margins can reflect the company's efficiency in managing operating expenses and generating profits. A stable or increasing trend in these margins indicates operational excellence and sustainable profitability.  **Balance Sheet Analysis**  The balance sheet provides insights into Renold Plc's assets, liabilities, and equity, showcasing its financial position and solvency. Analyzing key balance sheet ratios such as current ratio, quick ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and working capital can help assess the company's liquidity and financial health. The current ratio measures Renold Plc's ability to meet short-term obligations using its current assets. A ratio above 1 indicates the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities. The quick ratio, which excludes inventory from current assets, offers a more stringent measure of liquidity. A healthy quick ratio above 1 implies strong liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations without relying heavily on inventory.  The debt-to-equity ratio indicates the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing in Renold Plc's capital structure. A high debt-to-equity ratio may suggest higher financial risk due to increased leverage. It is crucial to monitor this ratio to ensure the company's capital structure is sustainable and not overly reliant on debt financing. Working capital, calculated as current assets minus current liabilities, represents Renold Plc's short-term financial health and operational efficiency. Positive working capital signifies that the company has excess current assets to cover short-term obligations, indicating liquidity and financial stability.  **Cash Flow Statement Analysis**  The cash flow statement highlights Renold Plc's sources and uses of cash over a specific period, providing valuable insights into its financial flexibility and ability to generate cash. Analyzing operating cash flow, investing cash flow, and financing cash flow can help evaluate the company's cash generation, capital investments, and financing activities. Positive operating cash flow indicates that Renold Plc's core business operations are generating cash, supporting day-to-day activities and investments. Investing cash flow reflects the company's capital expenditures on assets such as property, plant, and equipment, which are vital for future growth and efficiency improvements. Financing cash flow shows Renold Plc's activities related to issuing or repurchasing shares, paying dividends, and raising or repaying debt, influencing the company's capital structure and financial flexibility.  **Key Financial Ratios and Trends**  In addition to analyzing financial statements, key financial ratios can provide a comprehensive view of Renold Plc's financial performance. Some important ratios to consider include:  1. Return on Equity (ROE): ROE measures Renold Plc's profitability relative to shareholder equity, indicating how effectively the company is utilizing investors' funds to generate profits. 2. Return on Assets (ROA): ROA evaluates Renold Plc's efficiency in generating profits from its assets, reflecting management's ability to leverage assets to generate returns. 3.

"6151","""Metamorphoses was the only epic written by Ovid, and there are many notions of change within it; a point made immediately by the title itself, which means 'changing of forms'. Indeed, the first words of the epic lead one in to the ostensible subject matter; 'Of bodies changed to other forms I tell; You Gods, who have yourselves wrought every change.'But in my opinion, Ovid does not merely tell of change, but look at it from different angles, cast humorous or political allusions through it, and indeed change most concepts of what an epic poem had been up until that point. It is these things I wish to discuss in the following essay. There are approximately 5/80 stories told throughout the fifteen books of the Met., and all refer to a change in some way, in most cases as the main point of the story, but sometimes included into a familiar one as an excuse to write about it. The changes are treated in different ways by Ovid himself, by the various storyteller mouthpieces he uses, and in their own accounts. The Met. starts off with the tale of creation; things being made, changed from water and earth and nothingness into living, breathing creatures, a 'step up' the ladder of classification. In this way change is treated as something miraculous, something that transcends normal human understanding; it is brought about by the gods, but not any one of them in particular. The first actual change of one living, breathing person into another living thing is found with the story of Lycaon. Lycaon is one of the first race of humans, and so vile and corrupt that he serves up human flesh to Jupiter as a test of his divinity. A human daring to try and outwit a god; the impious Lycaon is changed by an angry Jupiter into a monster wolf. Thus here, change is used as a punishment, an interesting introduction by Ovid to the theme of metamorphosis. Most of the changes of humans or nymphs into other things by the gods can be divided simply into a few categories; change as a change through consequence, in which the gods seemed not to be the stars.. and many a time, forgetting what she was, hid from the creatures of the wild; a bear, she shuddered to see bears on the high hills.'She has kept her human thoughts and mind, which seems all the more cruel of Juno. Scylla was changed into a bird for her treachery, but seemed not to have known enough to regret it; Callisto's only crime was to be pretty, and it is through no fault of her own that Jupiter came and raped her. Indeed she even fought against him. How could this punishment be justified? Sometimes the crime for which transformation is the punishment is caught between these two extremes, however; and the way they are portrayed seems to be mixed. Arachne was a mortal woman who dared to think she could outweave Pallas Minerva, and does in fact do so; she is transformed into a spider by the angry goddess a punishment for her hubris, which is also a recurring theme. Is hubris that terrible a crime that it warrants transformation as a punishment? This brings us also to discuss how, bizarrely, an action that can be used as a punishment can also be used as a reward. Most of these transformations are simultaneously pity, in that they tend to happen as a result of a plea to the gods to save them from something terrible happening. Examples of this would be, as I said previously, Perdix who was saved from falling to his death, or Daphne, who was changed into a tree by her father the river god to prevent her rape at Apollo's hands. There were a few true rewards, as in Baucis and Philemon's case, where they lived their full lives together as they had requested from Jupiter, until the time came for them to die and they both turned into trees, to end together and live on in that way. What is interesting about this opposition of how change can be used is recognised by Ovid himself in Book II, with the story of the crow; she herself tells how she was pitied by Pallas and turned into a bird to escape the blandishments of the Sea god, and then banished from the goddess' sight for being a tell-tale. But this is not the worst of it, she says; 'But what good was it, if Nyctimene, She who was made a bird for her foul sin, Supplants me in my place of privilege?' 0Here Ovid is giving the reader just that curious viewpoint, and early on in the poem as well; this is setting you up to go on and read the rest of the Met. and try and see it that way, and whether those all-powerful gods are actually something to be feared or just as human and petty as the rest of us. And what of those changes which the gods are not even involved in? In the proem, it clearly states that it is the gods who 'wrought every change', and yet Ovid is quite happy to mention not only changes that are wrought by almost- changes that occur seemingly with no interference at all. Cygnus was changed to a swan and Niobe 1 to a and the deification of Augustus. Realising this, and the fact that the Metamorphoses was almost certainly finished before Ovid was sent into exile by Augustus in AD 6, one cannot ignore the possible political allusions made by the poem. As early as the first book, Apollo tells Daphne that she will always be a glorious tree, spanning even the gates of Augustus; by the end of the epic he beseeches the gods might be deified as was his father Caesar; '. But how can With being father of so fine an heir Under whose sovereignty mankind is given Such plenteous blessings by the power of heaven?'7This is obviously flattering the beginning as something to prove Augustus and the Roman people's stock as greater than that of the Greeks. But the way in which this is done is a lot more straightforward, and conversely, more hidden; with Augustus came change, from civil war to a much more peaceful, prosperous time, this cannot be denied. What of Rome itself, then? It surely was going through a time of change; previous epic hoped that their words would survive up until the climax of civilization, where they were currently, but Ovid is more forward-thinking than that. In Pythagoras' speech declaims that all cities rise and then fall, leaving nothing but names behind; after listing many famous cities that now lie in ruins, he goes on to talk of the power of Rome, but cleverly does not state that it will last forever. Instead, the power of poetry is portrayed as lasting much longer, putting Ovid himself as a poet above those people who have achieved other fame. With the Metamorphoses, Ovid is able to utilise so many different aspects that the word 'change' that he sings of might associate with. The physical change of a human into some other form of being, change as a punishment or a reward, change of storyteller throughout the epic, change in the very nature of epic itself; all of these are covered admirably, and there are surely yet more beneath the surface to find..

Comprising fifteen books and over 250 myths, this epic poem explores the concept of metamorphosis in its various forms – physical, emotional, and spiritual. Through vivid storytelling and powerful imagery, Ovid weaves together tales of gods, heroes, and ordinary mortals whose lives are irrevocably changed through radical change. These transformations serve as a lens through which Ovid examines profound human experiences such as love, loss, hubris, and redemption.  One of the defining features of """"Metamorphoses"""" is Ovid's portrayal of physical metamorphosis. The poem is replete with instances where individuals are transformed into animals, plants, or celestial bodies as a result of divine intervention, curses, or personal desires. These metamorphoses often symbolize the impermanence of life and the transience of human existence. For example, in the myth of Daphne and Apollo, Daphne, pursued by the amorous god, prays to be transformed to escape his advances and is turned into a laurel tree. This transformation not only highlights the power dynamics between mortals and immortals but also underscores the theme of self-preservation and the limits of free will.  Moreover, the theme of emotional transformation is prevalent throughout """"Metamorphoses."""" Ovid portrays characters undergoing profound emotional changes that redefine their identities and relationships. The story of Narcissus, a youth who falls in love with his own reflection and is transformed into a flower, illustrates the destructive nature of self-absorption and unrequited love. Similarly, the myth of Pygmalion and Galatea explores the transformative power of love as the sculptor Pygmalion's statue comes to life through his adoration and devotion. These emotional metamorphoses symbolize the transformative effects of passion, obsession, and desire on individuals and their perceptions of reality.  Furthermore, Ovid delves into the theme of spiritual transformation, where characters undergo inner changes that result in newfound wisdom, enlightenment, or punishment. The tale of Phaethon, the son of the sun god Helios, who fails to control his father's chariot and is struck down by a thunderbolt, serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and recklessness. Phaethon's tragic fate underscores the consequences of challenging the established order and overreaching one's capabilities. In contrast, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice explores the redemptive power of love and music as Orpheus descends into the underworld to rescue his beloved Eurydice, showcasing the transformative potential of art and devotion in overcoming death and despair.  Beyond individual stories, """"Metamorphoses"""" as a whole reflects the broader concept of transformation as a recurring motif in life itself. Ovid's fluid narrative style, characterized by its fluidity and interconnectivity of myths, mirrors the ever-changing nature of existence and the cyclical patterns of transformation. The poem suggests that change is not only inevitable but also essential for growth, renewal, and evolution. Whether through physical, emotional, or spiritual metamorphoses, Ovid invites readers to contemplate the complexities of transformation and its implications for personal identity, relationships, and the human experience.  In conclusion, Ovid's """"Metamorphoses"""" stands as a timeless exploration of the theme of transformation in all its manifestations. Through a rich tapestry of myths and allegories, Ovid crafts a nuanced portrayal of change as a fundamental aspect of existence. From physical metamorphoses that symbolize the fragility of life to emotional transformations that reveal the depths of human experience, """"Metamorphoses"""" offers profound insights into the nature of change, adaptation, and renewal. Ultimately, Ovid's epic poem challenges readers to confront the transformative forces at work in their own lives and consider the enduring power of metamorphosis in shaping individual destinies and collective consciousness.""","809"
"3119","""How are social inequalities reflected in what people eat? What positive measures can be taken by health and social care professionals to reduce inequalities in the diets of patients and service users? This essay will demonstrate how social inequalities in the UK can effect whether an individual has a healthy diet. This will be followed with ideas and suggestions, for health and social care professionals, to help improve the situation. Human survival depends on food and of an adequate diet can have serious consequences, such as; increased chance of deficiency diseases, reduced growth and reduced mental and physical development in children. (Webb, 002) The BDA recognised as early as 986 that certain groups were vulnerable to malnutrition, for example; children, pregnant women, ethnic minorities, disabled people, elderly and those on a low income. (Haines and de Lowry, 986 cited in Townsend and Davidson, 988) It was also established at this time that differences in the quantity and quality of food eaten occurred between social groups. (The Health Divide, Whitehead in Townsend and Davidson, 988) An unhealthy or inadequate diet can have other serious consequences to health, as diet has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, obesity, cancer and diabetes. (Muston, 001) The Health Divide also reported that people on low incomes tended to eat less fresh fruits, vegetables and high fibre foods and more fat and sugar than those with higher incomes. (Whitehead in Townsend and Davidson, 988) Due to this information being reported more than twenty years ago, it might be quite reasonable to consider it irrelevant. However, the Government has recently admitted not everyone has an equal chance of a healthy life and identified two of the main killers as coronary heart disease and cancers. (Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation, 999) It is recognised in today's society, malnutrition and deficiency diseases are more common in certain groups such as; people living in extremes of social and economic disadvantage, disabled people and the very elderly. (Webb, 002) Therefore, it is clear that much of the information from the Health Divide is still relevant in today's society. To illustrate this further, ten years after the Health Divide was written it was shown that social class differences in mortality were widening. (Smithal. 990) To understand how people's diets are influenced by their role in society, it is necessary to also consider the factors that affect food choice. Food choice depends on how available the food is locally, for example, transportation links and shopping facilities. (Webb, 002) For instance, changes in food retailing which occurred from 980- 992, when there was in increase in large out- of - town supermarkets, disadvantaged poor families as they did not have transport. (Smith and Brunner, 997) In particular, women, elderly and disabled people are greater disadvantaged in terms of mobility and transport. (Nelson, 997) Knowledge of nutrition and religious and cultural beliefs about food may affect food choice. (Webb, 002) Education can be linked to level of socioeconomic class, for example people with more education are more likely to be in the higher levels, therefore, have the knowledge and the funds to achieve a healthy diet. (Murcott, 998) Murcott has also identified; ignorance, discrimination or hostility towards ethnic minorities as factors that may affect their dietary balance, for example, availability and cost of traditional foods. This point is further illustrated by the difficulties Muslims face when trying to translate information on food additives to determine whether food is halal or not. (Bradby cited in Murcott, 998) The implications of the factors that affect food choice can be important, such as; afro- Caribbean women in the UK are more likely to suffer from hypertension and diabetes. (Forresteral. cited in Garrow et al, 000) Financial resources, budgeting skills and the cost of foods are very important for influencing food choice. (Webb, 002) Richer people spend nearly 5/8% more on food than those on low incomes. (Webb, 002) Poorer households consume less fruit juice or fruit, lean meat, wholemeal products and fewer salads are more likely to eat white bread, potatoes, cheaper fatty meats, beans, eggs and chips. (Gregory et al cited in Dowler and Dobson, 997) Experts advise eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, however, children from low income families are eating less than half this and some did not eat any at all in a week. (Department of Health/ Food Standards Agency, 000) This report also identified that young people, from low income families, are eating too much salt, sometimes twice the recommended levels. As a consequence of lack of adequate finances, people with lower income have lower levels of micronutrients such as; vitamins A, B, C and iron, magnesium, potassium, calcium and phosphorus in their diets. (Smith and Brunner, 997) Disabled people and those who have long- term illness are known to be vulnerable to poverty, therefore, will also experience difficulty in maintaining a healthy diet. (Hantrais cited in Dowler and Dobson, 997) Also, some disabled people may require special foods and feeding equipment which will add to the costs of their food shopping. People in low- income households are very skilled at budgeting, and often food is the only flexible item in the household finances, paying the bills has a higher priority than buying fruit. (Kempson, cited in Dowler and Dobson, 997) This means there is less money spent on unnecessary items, such as; alcohol and treats, cheaper brands from the cheapest shops are purchased and lower quality items are bought that provide more calories per penny. (Webb, 002) As a consequence people on low incomes have a less diverse, overweight and obesity can be linked to people with lower incomes. (Nutrition and Physical Activity Task Force cited in Smith and Brunner, 997) Although the unhealthy diet of many people on low incomes may explain this trend, it could also be due to being unable to afford expensive diet foods, or join a diet group, or not having leisure time to exercise due to work commitments. Murcott, 998) It is clear that many people in society are unable to maintain a healthy diet, as a result will suffer from health consequences. As health and social care professionals, it is important to understand how and why people are unable to eat as healthily as they should be. It would be too easy as a professional to blame individuals for being lazy, or incompetent with their finances as the reason. However, this does not mean we should give our patients/ clients sympathy; this will not help them to eat a healthier diet. Instead, it is more appropriate to offer sound advice and support on practical solutions to their problems. This could be to introduce them to various community projects, such as; Food for Fun which aims to raise awareness of food through fun activities; particularly looking at nutritional and low cost foods for children's lunch boxes and it also has food tasting sessions. (Food Poverty Projects Database, 004) Projects such as these are available for everyone, for example; elderly, ex- offenders, HIV/ AIDS sufferers, homeless people, people with learning disabilities, minority ethnic groups and single parents. These projects provide valuable access to foods and teach skills that would not be learnt otherwise, however, they suffer from; lack of funding, isolation of individual initiative, lack of support from relevant professionals and reliance on volunteers. (Nelson, 997) Therefore, it would benefit patients/ clients if more professionals were involved in similar projects, they could help raise the profile of the project which may bring in more long- term funding. Also, people may feel better knowing they are being given advice from a professional person. Other ways of providing practical advice and support would be to help raise awareness of patients/ clients eligibility to benefits or other financial support. Some patients/ clients may not be aware they are entitled to financial support for special foods, feeding equipment etc. which could benefit them. Also Nelson identified another problem with community projects; that more research is needed. This research needs to provide government and local authorities with information about practical initiatives that are proven to work. Therefore, health and social care professionals could benefit their patients/ clients by carrying out further research that will provide this information, which will allow the success of projects to be repeated across the UK instead of only certain areas. In conclusion, health and social care professionals may achieve success in their patient/ client group, but the problem of unequal health due to diet is widespread across Britain and affects millions. Therefore, although professionals can and should help it is impossible for them to address the problem on their own. The government needs to be more involved by providing long term funding across the UK to help people to achieve a healthier diet. However, the Government has been aware of the inequalities for a long time, and yet they appear to be getting wider. Therefore, it may be appropriate for the Government to address the issue of benefit and social support levels as they are clearly not providing many with sufficient funds for a healthy diet. In reality, there are people who are lazy and not competent at managing their finances; however, it is unfair to stereotype everyone on a low income as doing the same. Everyone should be able to purchase the foods they require to maintain their health and to provide their families with the correct nutrients to grow and flourish. URL URL URL ReflectionI have worked with adults who have learning disability and Prader- Willi Syndrome, which is a genetic eating disorder, for the last four years. Therefore, I was already aware of many of the issues that effect health and social care professionals. It is necessary to consistently be aware of your own actions and behaviour, to ensure you are acting in a professional manner. It is also necessary to question your own attitudes and assumptions, to ensure you are not treating an individual differently because of their actions or behaviour. Many people find it difficult to understand adults with learning disabilities and make the mistake of treating them like children. It may be that some adults with learning disability do have a level of understanding similar to a child; however they are not children and so should not be treated like children. I also believe care homes may attract people who display abusive behaviour towards the residents/ clients. For instance, I have seen many care staff abuse their power by withholding help or assistance because they can. I find this kind of behaviour completely unacceptable, and as a senior support worker have been responsible for reprimanding individuals. Overall, I have found the majority of people who display this kind of behaviour are very much aware of what they are doing, and will continue to do so when given the opportunity. I have also observed sexism displayed by negative attitudes towards male care workers from females. It is often still believed that men do not have the skills necessary to care for others. However, I believe both males and females are capable of working in a care environment depending on the individual. I have always thought of myself as being open- minded, and would like to think I do not behave in a discriminatory behaviour towards anyone. However, I also believe everyone has attitudes and beliefs about some people that could be seen as discriminatory. For this reason, I believe it is how a person behaves towards others that is important not what they are thinking. I have always worked hard to ensure I am acting in a professional manner, and performing to the best of my abilities, therefore, I expect the same from my colleagues. I am fairly confident in challenging other people if I think they are behaving in a manner inappropriate for a professional. Prior to the learning on this module I thought of myself as being very open- minded and aware of many different discriminations and inequalities. However, I have since realised I was ignorant in certain areas, for example, homophobia. I was unaware an individuals sexuality could be on a continuum, I have previously thought of people as either 'straight' or 'gay' and did not realise people could fall anywhere along a continuum. However, when I reflected on this I realised it makes sense that an individual's sexuality is a complicated issue and cannot be categorised so easily. I was also unaware of the high level of violence directed towards gay people and men from ethnic minorities in particular. I was surprised to discover how widespread racism still is in Britain today and how this relates to poverty and food inequalities. The result of this is an unhealthy diet which has serious health consequences for individuals, particularly the elderly. I have previously been aware of how an individual can use power, as described above, but was not aware of larger scale institutional and economic power. Elderly and disabled people are consistently discriminated against by large companies who do not provide them the necessary equipment or support they need to either enter a building or take part in an activity. Overall, I was shocked that discrimination and inequality is so widespread across the UK, and thought the health inequalities between the rich and those in poverty were disgraceful. It is obvious that this needs to be improved and health and social care professionals can be part of the solution. I think as a future health and social care professional employee, it is very important that I have been made aware of all the issues discussed in this module. I believe this knowledge will allow me to be a better professional, as hopefully I will be able to treat patients as individuals and not be judgemental. I hope to make the time my patients spend with me pleasant, by being approachable and sensitive to their individual needs and not treating everyone in the same manner. I would ensure I listen to individuals needs and ask them how I can help, rather than insisting I know best. I would be prepared to offer advice and support on other aspects of an individuals life if it was appropriate, for example, it is pointless for me to give someone dietary advice when they are having difficulty buying the most basic food items. Therefore, I could help put them in contact with financial advice and support agencies. In general I will try to treat everyone as an individual and not to be judgemental, even if they are behaving in a way that I do not agree with. I accept that it will be very difficult as sometimes you can do or say the wrong thing without realising it until it is brought to your attention. For this reason, I will try and be aware of all the issues that might affect an individual and how they behave, for example, whether they are male/ female, old/ young, disabled, elderly, from an ethnic minority or gay. I think it is also important to consider how I appear to my patients; there may be issues about my own appearance or behaviour that is unacceptable to some people. To allow a consistent approach to patients I think it is necessary for a health care professional to participate in regular reflection of their own behaviour and attitudes. Finally, I would ensure if I witness any individual being treated in a discriminatory manner I would report it to the appropriate person, as not speaking up is just as damaging to the individual. I believe health and social care professionals are capable of reducing the amount of inequality and discrimination in the NHS, however, the Government is also responsible and could reduce it nationwide through changes in policy and legislation.""","""Social inequalities in dietary health""","3094","""Social Inequalities in Dietary Health  Social inequalities in dietary health are pervasive issues that affect individuals and communities worldwide. The access to nutritious food, education about healthy eating habits, and socioeconomic factors all play a significant role in shaping people's dietary health. These disparities often result in unequal opportunities for individuals to maintain a balanced diet, leading to a wide range of health consequences. Understanding the root causes of these social inequalities and addressing them through targeted interventions is crucial to promoting health equity and improving overall well-being.  One of the key aspects of social inequalities in dietary health is the unequal access to nutritious food. In many communities, especially in low-income areas and marginalized populations, there is limited access to fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources. This lack of access to healthy food options, commonly known as food deserts, contributes to higher rates of obesity, malnutrition, and chronic diseases in these communities. Individuals living in food deserts may rely on convenience stores or fast-food outlets for their meals, which tend to be high in calories, saturated fats, and sugars but low in essential nutrients.  Additionally, the cost of healthy food compared to unhealthy, processed foods is often prohibitive for many individuals with lower incomes. This economic barrier further exacerbates social inequalities in dietary health, as those with limited financial resources may opt for cheaper, less nutritious options to feed themselves and their families. The affordability of healthy food is a critical factor that influences dietary choices and ultimately impacts overall health outcomes. Addressing the affordability of nutritious food through various strategies, such as subsidies for fresh produce or incentives for retailers to offer healthier options, can help mitigate these disparities.  Education and nutritional knowledge also play a significant role in shaping dietary behaviors and health outcomes. Individuals who have access to accurate information about healthy eating habits, meal planning, and food preparation are better equipped to make informed decisions about their dietary choices. However, disparities in health literacy and education levels can create barriers to accessing and understanding this information, particularly for vulnerable populations. Lack of nutritional education can lead to misconceptions about what constitutes a healthy diet, resulting in poor dietary habits and negative health consequences.  Moreover, cultural and social factors influence dietary practices and food preferences within different communities. Dietary habits are often ingrained in cultural traditions, family customs, and social norms, shaping individuals' food choices and eating patterns. These cultural influences can both positively and negatively impact dietary health, depending on the context. For example, traditional diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may promote health and well-being, whereas diets high in processed foods and sugary beverages can contribute to chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes.  Socioeconomic factors such as income level, employment status, and access to healthcare services also intersect with dietary health outcomes. Individuals facing economic hardships are more likely to experience food insecurity, which refers to the lack of consistent access to an adequate amount of nutritious food. Food insecurity is a significant risk factor for poor dietary health, as individuals may resort to consuming inexpensive, calorie-dense foods that provide short-term satiety but lack essential nutrients for long-term health. The stress and uncertainty associated with food insecurity can further impact mental health and overall well-being, creating a cycle of poor health outcomes.  Furthermore, disparities in healthcare access and quality can affect individuals' ability to receive proper nutrition guidance and preventive care. Limited access to healthcare services, nutritionists, and dietitians can hinder individuals from seeking professional support for managing their dietary health. This lack of support and guidance can perpetuate unhealthy eating habits and exacerbate existing health conditions, leading to poorer health outcomes in the long run. Addressing disparities in healthcare access and ensuring that all individuals have the resources they need to make informed decisions about their dietary health are essential steps toward achieving health equity.  To tackle social inequalities in dietary health, a multi-faceted approach is needed that addresses the root causes of these disparities and implements targeted interventions to promote health equity. Policy interventions that focus on improving food access, affordability, and quality can help create environments that support healthy eating habits for all individuals. For instance, initiatives like community gardens, farmers' markets, and subsidy programs for healthy foods can increase the availability of nutritious options in underserved areas and empower individuals to make healthier choices.  Education and awareness campaigns that promote nutritional literacy and provide practical tips for healthy eating can also empower individuals to take control of their dietary health. By equipping people with the knowledge and skills needed to make informed decisions about their diets, we can empower them to adopt healthier lifestyles and reduce the risk of diet-related diseases. Additionally, culturally sensitive approaches that respect diverse food traditions and preferences can help promote healthy dietary practices within different communities, fostering inclusivity and understanding.  In conclusion, social inequalities in dietary health are complex issues that stem from a combination of factors, including access to nutritious food, education, cultural influences, and socioeconomic disparities. Addressing these inequalities requires a comprehensive approach that considers the unique needs and challenges faced by different populations. By implementing targeted interventions that promote food access, affordability, education, and healthcare equity, we can work towards reducing disparities in dietary health and improving overall well-being for all individuals. Health equity is achievable when we prioritize equitable access to nutritious food and empower individuals to make healthy choices that support their long-term health and wellness.""","1057"

All statistics, even the most authoritative, are created by people' (Gilbert, 001). This does not mean that they are inevitably flawed or wrong, but it does mean that we ought to ask ourselves just how the statistics we encounter were created. Not recently, official statistics have been questioned as to the degree of their validity, reliability and objectivity and whether these are in fact essential. When considering whether sociologists should use official statistics one has to consider whether the limitations outweigh the advantages to using them in accordance with the researcher's theoretical perspective. Many sociologists believe there is an exaggerated suspicion of social measurement and an excessive distrust of officially produced numerical data. Most researchers that are positivist in nature need to examine the social world in an objective and scientific way and those who produce these statistics make every effort to follow the scientific canons to ensure the reliability and validity of their work. Precise measurement and accuracy are considered to be possible in this kind of survey experiment with statistics. Objectivity is ensured because researchers are following a set process and maintaining a standard known by those using the statistics. Reliable quantified statistics are converted into data without much problem, involving minimal time and costs, thus ensuring accurate measurement requirements. (Manheim et al, 002) While positivists feel that any problems with official statistics can be improved with improved measurement and data collection procedures it is argued that there are some complex problems in addition to positivist concerns of error and bias. First, as Bulmer points out there are the difficulties associated with 'social measurement' as compared to the measurement of monetary units or spatial the potential sociological contribution to social statistics. He goes on to explain that theoretical and conceptual analysis are independent of political position proved by the study of social-class and health and wealth distribution that 'has probably done more to bring about a degree of social change than it has to bolster social policies'. There is a more general critique of official statistics some of which is explained before. May especially has had an important voice in recognising the failings of official statistics ranging from problems of definition to detection. For example, with relation to official criminal records he correctly points out that the definition of criminal is not static but will change over time. The decision to report a crime also depends upon a whole range of factors, such as the place where it was perpetrated, the identity of the offender, and, whether it is thought appropriate for the the gulf between the common-sense assumptions of statisticians and the theoretical constructs of sociology may not be quite as wide as it is sometimes supposed. One problem associated with the use of official statistics especially is the deficient coverage of key social variables. As the official statistics were not necessarily produced with the studies sociologists carry out, often certain aspects of a study may be left out that we are unaware of as we were not present. Once there it is possible to record parts of reality that are otherwise not imagined, probably leading to a rearrangement of the researchers focus with regard to their social interactions in the reality in which they are. These other dimensions are absent in official statistics though in some cases one cannot but help use them. The basic problem then is that statistics are collected for some other purpose and it is not possible to explore any other areas except the 'facts' already presented. This limitation is obviously avoided when the sociologist is performing his or her own study and is a strong argument in favour of sociologists not relying on official statistics but seeking to generate their own. While in some cases it proves better for sociologists to generate their own data, in some cases it is not possible and official statistics are essential, for example, when dealing with the past, because we have no other information to help us. One obstacle though is the social change processes which can create major difficulties in using official statistics as a source of longitudinal largely from an anti-positivist stance, today, using the method of pluralistic triangulation, I feel that reliability and validity can be largely ensured. 'Official information, imperfect and badly adapted for sociological purposes as it often is, generally suffices to show the magnitude, nature and locality of a problem; common knowledge, obtainable by conversation with those who have live in close contact with tits circumstances, will place it is fair perspective, while a rapid investigation by sample will give an approximation to detailed measurements' (Bowley, 915/8 cited in Best, 001). We need statistics to talk sensibly about social problems. The solution, then, is not to give up on statistics, but to become better judges of the numbers we encounter, encouraging sociologists to use official statistics being aware of their drawbacks and together with other methods used to support the study.""","""Official statistics and sociological research""","989","""Official statistics and sociological research play crucial roles in understanding and analyzing various aspects of society. Official statistics are data collected and published by government agencies or other authorized organizations. These statistics provide valuable information about demographics, social trends, economic conditions, and more, serving as a foundation for evidence-based policymaking and decision-making. Sociological research, on the other hand, involves systematic investigation into social phenomena, aiming to uncover patterns, relationships, and dynamics within society. By combining official statistics with sociological research, scholars and policymakers can gain deeper insights into social issues and develop informed strategies for addressing them.  Official statistics serve as a backbone for sociological research by providing a wealth of quantitative data on a wide range of topics. These statistics cover areas such as population demographics, education levels, employment rates, crime rates, healthcare access, and much more. Researchers can utilize this data to identify trends, patterns, and disparities within society. For example, official statistics on income distribution can be analyzed to understand economic inequality, while demographic data can shed light on population growth and migration patterns. By grounding their research in official statistics, sociologists can contextualize their findings and draw robust conclusions about social phenomena.  Despite the wealth of information offered by official statistics, they have their limitations. Data collection methods may be subject to biases, errors, or underrepresentation of certain groups. For instance, marginalized communities may be undercounted in official surveys, leading to inaccurate portrayals of their experiences. Sociological research plays a crucial role in complementing official statistics by delving deeper into the underlying causes and implications of social trends. Through qualitative interviews, ethnographic observations, and other research methods, sociologists can provide a more nuanced understanding of social issues that may not be captured in quantitative data alone.  Sociological research also contributes to the improvement of official statistics by identifying gaps in data collection and suggesting more inclusive methodologies. For example, by conducting fieldwork in communities that are traditionally underrepresented in surveys, sociologists can highlight the need for more targeted data collection approaches to ensure a comprehensive understanding of society. By bridging the gap between quantitative data and qualitative analysis, sociological research enhances the accuracy and relevance of official statistics, leading to more effective policy interventions and social programs.  The synergy between official statistics and sociological research is particularly evident in areas such as public health, education, and criminal justice. Health researchers can utilize official health statistics to track disease prevalence and healthcare access, while sociologists can investigate the social determinants of health outcomes through qualitative research. By combining both approaches, policymakers can develop holistic interventions that address both the medical and social aspects of public health challenges.  Similarly, in education, official statistics on graduation rates and academic achievement can be complemented by sociological research on factors influencing student success, such as family background, teacher quality, and school environment. This multidimensional approach enables stakeholders to implement targeted strategies for improving educational outcomes for all students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  In the realm of criminal justice, official crime statistics offer insights into crime rates and trends, while sociological research can delve into the root causes of criminal behavior, the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs, and the impact of law enforcement practices on communities. By integrating official statistics with sociological insights, policymakers can work towards a more equitable and effective criminal justice system that addresses systemic issues and promotes community well-being.  Overall, the collaboration between official statistics and sociological research is essential for a comprehensive understanding of society. By combining quantitative data with qualitative analysis, researchers and policymakers can gain deeper insights into complex social issues, identify areas for improvement in data collection and analysis, and design more targeted interventions that address the needs of diverse populations. This interdisciplinary approach not only advances our understanding of society but also contributes to the development of evidence-based policies that promote social justice, equality, and well-being for all members of society.""","766"
"6108","""Task The brief for Introductory Programming Practical was to design, build and test a program to calculate the two inputs, A and B, and return the results in G and L. This practical task was intended to demonstrate the correct use of procedures and parameters in Delphi, and, as such, must include both of these within the program code A suitable user interface was required of the finished article which would facilitate access to the full set of operations of the program. The procedure to be used in the program, GCDandLCM, as well as a full and more detailed brief are to be found on the attached pink practical sheet. Design & DevelopmentDesigning the program to meet the criteria of the brief stipulated, to fulfil the needs of the program whilst at all times considering the essential integration of the provided procedure was the first task in the Design and Development phase of the project. The design of the form was the first consideration, and in my design plan I decided that the best way for the user to input the two values, A and B, required by the program would be to include two edit boxes on the form with suitable layers and comments to provide ease of use to the user. A single button with suitable label would be needed to execute the procedure GCDandLCM when clicked by the user. And a Message information added in code and the output variables G and L would be the best way of communicating the output to the user. Below is a Data Flow diagram that graphically illustrates the flow of data through the system, beginning with a 'black box' outside overview of the Input-Process-Output functions of the program in the LEVEL diagram, followed by a more detailed 'white box' examination of the internal processes in the LEVEL diagram. After adding a suitable title, colour scheme and fonts and sizing the form to an adequate portion of an average display, I added the following must put it in context, as such I would use enclose descriptive text in the message box with the integer values. Finally, below this, I would use a separate function which contains and implementation of Delphi's while loop to calculate the value of the LCM from the output generated by the Euclidean algorithm in the previous statement, and pass this output back to the CaculateGCDLCMButtonClick event handler to be displayed in the ShowMessage output. A try statement, shown below, would be added to the beginning of the event handler procedure to provide data validation and prompt the user when invalid inputs are entered. In order that variables did not carry over values from a previous execution of code, both were reset to a value of before continuing, as both the GCD and LCM of are equal to. All of this code would be contained within the event handler procedure for the user's clicking of the form's only button; The full source code for my solution can be found in the Unit Listing below. Data for TestingIn order to accurately test the implemented solution, suitable test data was required. The data tabulated below would be entered into the Edit box during the testing phase, with the expected outcome noted alongside it. These inputs were chosen for test data based on the following reasoning: The use of character values in either input should not be allowed and if my code is correct should generate the error message described The use of non- in either input should not be allowed and if my code is correct should generate the error message described The inputs in tests, and have know GCD and LCM as such provide two ways of checking the procedure works to give us known answers. Unit Listing ProblemsThe only problem encountered after the implementation of the solution was that the program was crashing whenever an unexpected value was entered into the edit boxes (an exception), unexpected being out the expected integer values (being a floating point, negative or character value). After attempting to find the root of the problem, I discovered that the fault did not occur when the compiled, finished.exe of the program was executed outside of Delphi. The problem was being caused by Delphi's integrated error handling stepping in to report the problem before the try statement implemented in code could handle the exception. This therefore was not a problem as the finished program would function as intended. TestingFor each planned test value, I ran through the input and recorded the output. My testing provided the expected results as outlined at the end of the Design and Development phase on page, proving within reasonable bounds that my program works as specified and intended. Sample RunConclusionThe brief on the attached Practical Sheet has been fulfilled in full with each of the criteria specified in the Task section being met. Correct values for GCD and LCM are produced for integers A and B entered into edit boxes by the user A suitable error message is displayed for invalid input The provided procedure, GCDandLCM, was implemented in the program as required The Euclidean algorithm was adapted and implemented as required A suitable user interface for this procedure was designed and implemented as stipulated by the design brief Furthermore, during the stages of the completion of this assignment and this associated report I have learnt about procedures and parameters, as per the intended goal of the set assignment. Procedures were used in the form of the GCDandLCM procedure provided, and in my design of procedure GCDLCMButtonClick to handle the event of the user clicking the calculate button Parameters were used in the defining and subsequent calling of constants A and B and variables G and L as formal parameters within the procedure GCDandLCM""","""Programming Assignment Design and Implementation""","1101","""Programming Assignment Design and Implementation:  Designing and implementing programming assignments is a critical aspect of computer science education and software development. Whether you are a student tackling assignments or a professional creating tasks for others, a well-structured and thoughtfully crafted programming assignment can lead to better learning outcomes, improved skills, and a deeper understanding of coding concepts.  When designing a programming assignment, several key elements need to be considered to ensure its effectiveness. Firstly, a clear and concise problem statement is essential. The problem statement should define the task to be completed, outline the expected input and output, specify any constraints or requirements, and provide example scenarios to illustrate the problem.  Next, it is crucial to define the programming languages, tools, and frameworks that students or developers are allowed or required to use. Providing guidelines on the technology stack helps set expectations and allows for a standardized evaluation process. It is important to strike a balance between allowing for creativity and imposing necessary constraints to achieve the learning objectives.  Furthermore, breaking down the assignment into smaller, manageable tasks or subproblems can help students focus on one aspect at a time, leading to a more structured and systematic approach to problem-solving. This incremental design encourages students to build on small successes and iterate towards a complete solution, fostering a growth mindset and resilience in the face of challenges.  Additionally, considering the complexity of the assignment is crucial. Assignments should be challenging enough to stimulate critical thinking and problem-solving skills but not so difficult that they lead to frustration and discouragement. As students progress through their programming journey, the complexity of assignments should increase gradually to match their skill development.  Collaboration and feedback mechanisms play a vital role in the successful implementation of programming assignments. Encouraging peer reviews, providing opportunities for students to discuss their solutions, and offering timely feedback can enhance the learning experience and promote a sense of community among learners. Feedback should not only focus on the correctness of the code but also on the efficiency, readability, and elegance of the solutions.  From an implementation perspective, clear documentation outlining the assignment requirements, submission guidelines, evaluation criteria, and deadlines is essential. Providing well-defined rubrics or scoring guidelines can help students understand how their work will be assessed and what is expected of them. Consistency in evaluation criteria ensures fairness and transparency in the grading process.  Automated testing and grading tools can streamline the evaluation process, especially for large classes or online courses. These tools can assess the correctness of the code, check for common errors, and provide instant feedback to students, allowing them to iterate on their solutions and improve their skills iteratively.  Incorporating real-world applications or industry-relevant problems in programming assignments can make the tasks more engaging and meaningful for learners. By simulating practical scenarios that programmers may encounter in their careers, students can see the relevance of the concepts they are learning and develop a deeper appreciation for the power of coding in solving real-world challenges.  In conclusion, designing and implementing programming assignments requires careful consideration of various factors, including problem statement clarity, technology stack definition, task decomposition, complexity management, collaboration opportunities, feedback mechanisms, documentation clarity, evaluation criteria, automated testing tools, and real-world relevance. By incorporating these elements thoughtfully, educators and professionals can create engaging and impactful assignments that promote learning, skill development, and a deeper understanding of programming concepts.""","660"
"3126","""Durkheim first used the term anomie in his work, 'The Division of Labour in Society' (893), anomie is a breakdown in group solidarity and cohesion or deregulation. This leads to people feeling like they have no control, a sort of 'normlessness' or 'lawlessness'. Anomie has also been likened to a 'loss of purpose', 'anomie carries the connotation of alienation, isolation, and desocialization. Anomie is the discord in the rhythm of social life' ((Powell, 970, p.). Anomie has been linked to suicide, crime, delinquency, mental disorders, alcoholism and drug addiction. There are many forms of anomie as Talcott-Parsons has shown, 'when the person is unable to make institutionally accepted object-attachments with, for example, the opposite sex'. As a functionalist, one of Durkheim's main aims was to apply sociological knowledge to social intervention by the state in order to create social harmony. By saying this he stressed 'social integration and moral consensus'. This would modernity society. His 'belief in the importance of well-organised and harmonious societies' meant 'individuals could flourish and live out their lives productively and contentedly together' (Biltonal. 002, p.70). Lives within society are patterned by forces that are out of our control, therefore we should 'treat social facts as things' (p.71) to structure our lives to run smoothly. When these forces are seemingly out of our control we experience explains variation in suicide rates in terms of integration and regulation and within this there are four types of suicide. Integration means the extent to which the individual experiences a sense of collective belonging, (Durkheim called this the 'collective conscious' it's based on common interests and feelings direct of all individuals within society). If integration is too high then Altruistic suicide can occur, e.g. selfless acts such as World War II fighter pilots where there was an extreme sense of moral obligation to the country. On the other hand if integration is too low Egoistic suicide can occur where people don't feel they are well enough integrated into society, in other words, a weak 'collective conscious'. Regulation is the extent to which the actions and desires of individuals are kept in check by moral values. If someone is too regulated they feel a sense of hopelessness or 'no way out' then Fatalistic suicide can occur (e.g. people in prison). Again on the flip side if regulation is too low Anomic suicide can occur, here there are no checks on the individual (e.g. the unemployed who have no regulation of time). Anomic suicide is where society is incapable of exercising authority over individuals and periods of disruption unleash currents of anomie which increase suicide rates (Halcli, week, lecture notes). Durkheim described two types of unity in society 'mechanical' and 'organic' solidarity. Modern society would be 'organic' and levels of anomie would be low, the collective conscience would be high and would be expressed through values, customs, and law etc and then back up by sanctions from the government. This solution, non-religious civic moral order established through state, law and education would create moral unity based on mutual social interdependence otherwise known as 'organic solidarity' or modernity (Biltonal. 002, p.72). At his time of writing, the transition from mechanical to organic solidarity was incomplete and that is why he wanted to modernise to an organic society. Therein, 'A unified and well regulated society diminishes both egotistic and anomic currents' (Marshall, 964, p.), this is seen as essential since without norms humans develop insatiable desires that lead to a disordered society with anomic currents. Word count: 5/87 words.""","""Anomie and social cohesion""","799","""Anomie and social cohesion are two fundamental concepts in sociology that shed light on how individuals and societies function in relation to norms, values, and social order. Anomie, a term introduced by French sociologist Emile Durkheim in the late 19th century, refers to a state of normlessness or a breakdown of social norms and values within a society. On the other hand, social cohesion encompasses the degree to which members of a society feel connected, share common goals, and cooperate with one another. These concepts are interconnected and play crucial roles in shaping the well-being and functioning of communities.  Anomie occurs when there is a disconnection between individual aspirations and societal expectations or when there is a lack of clear social norms guiding behavior. This disorientation can lead to a sense of alienation, confusion, and a breakdown of social order. Anomie is often associated with rapid social change, economic instability, and inadequate social integration. For instance, in times of economic upheaval or rapid modernization, individuals may struggle to adapt to new social conditions, leading to a weakening of social norms and an increase in deviant behavior.  The concept of social cohesion, on the other hand, focuses on the bonds that hold a society together. It encompasses social inclusion, trust, mutual support, and a sense of belonging among members of a community. Building social cohesion is essential for fostering a sense of collective identity, promoting cooperation, and ensuring the well-being of individuals within a society. Strong social cohesion is linked to lower rates of crime, increased social trust, and better overall mental and physical health outcomes.  The relationship between anomie and social cohesion is complex. Anomie can threaten social cohesion by eroding trust, weakening communal ties, and fostering individualistic behavior at the expense of collective well-being. When individuals feel disconnected from society or lack a sense of purpose and belonging, they may be more prone to engaging in antisocial or deviant behaviors. This can further contribute to a cycle of social disintegration and alienation.  Conversely, strong social cohesion can act as a buffer against anomie. When communities are tightly knit, with strong social ties and a shared sense of purpose, individuals are more likely to adhere to social norms, support one another, and contribute to the common good. In such cohesive societies, individuals are less likely to feel isolated or marginalized, reducing the risk of anomie and its associated negative consequences.  Efforts to address anomie and strengthen social cohesion require a multi-faceted approach. This can involve promoting social inclusion, fostering community engagement, providing support systems for individuals in need, and cultivating a sense of shared identity and belonging. Policies that address social inequalities, promote social integration, and invest in community-building initiatives can help strengthen social cohesion and reduce the prevalence of anomie.  In conclusion, anomie and social cohesion are crucial concepts that shape the fabric of societies. Anomie represents a breakdown of social norms and values, while social cohesion signifies the strength of social bonds and mutual support within a community. By understanding and addressing these concepts, societies can work towards creating a more cohesive, inclusive, and supportive environment for all its members, ultimately fostering greater well-being and harmony.""","645"
"263","""Resource Management:Initially the plan for the second part of the project was to complete the design totally then begin implementation, iterating the analysis, design and implementation as required. Having completed an initial analysis for part one of the project, we felt it would be preferable to do a rough design then to begin the basic implementation, effectively running design and implementation in parallel but with design a few steps ahead. The critical path analysis can be seen below. The analyses, designs and implementations are constantly iterated in parallel throughout the project, but both equal in length. We felt that our initial staff estimates would have given us a very large design team for the size of task, possibly over-complicating the design process, and we were keen to begin the implementation as quickly as possible as we were aware it was the largest task which was likely to take the most time. This meant that we had to redistribute effort and people accordingly. The initial staff plan was given in part one of the project and the final revised version can be seen below. We iterated the analysis and design as implementation progressed, with team members swapping between roles as they became free. For example, Brian McWilliams had been heavily involved with analysis in part one of the project so was allocated tasks in the first stages of implementation then, when these were completed, was able to swap to iterating the analysis documents. We aimed to make the work distribution as fair as possible, while aiming for optimal use of each team member's time - this included making use of their existing skills, such as using those who had been most involved with analysis in part one to iterate the analysis in part two. The initial effort and schedule estimates were included in part one of the project and the final revised version can be seen below, split between weeks and activities. Source Code Control:For the majority of the on the code, source code control was relatively simple. He stored the code on his computer, keeping regular backups and creating new code versions when significant code alterations were required, so that he could revert to earlier versions if the modifications did not work correctly. He made sure he notified the other team members if he wanted to make changes to how the GUI interfaced with the rest of the program. Beyond, he simply kept track of the changes himself as the rest of the team did not need to know how it worked, only what interface it would present to the rest of the program. Remaining Code:The chief implementer - Kisan Kansagra - was put in charge of looking after the central code repository and ensuring that all stored program versions were consistent. All code which was not directly related to the GUI was stored in a password protected folder in his public area on the DCS machines. All team members were notified of the password so that they could view the code as required. Whenever team members created new code modules or altered existing ones, they either informed Kisan or placed the new/altered files in the repository with a different file name, so that previous versions were not overwritten and lost. Kisan made sure each group member was aware of such additions and alterations so that everyone was aware which version they should be working from. Installing, Compiling and Executing:In order to compile the code initially, the code controller first ensured that all relevant files were part of the race package and placed them all in a single race folder. He then navigated to this folder at a command prompt and typed 'javac.java' to compile all the Java files within the folder and so create the required.class files. The original Java code files were then copied to another separate the compiled from the uncompiled code. These two then put together in a zipped folder. In order to install the program, the user simply needs to copy the zipped folder to the area they wish to install it in, then unzip folder there. The program will then be installed in this location and can be run by navigating to the folder at a command prompt and typing 'java race.Report ' for the command line version or 'java race.Gui' for the graphical version.""","""Project Management and Code Implementation""","814","""Project management and code implementation are two crucial components in the world of software development. Efficiently combining both aspects is essential for the successful completion of coding projects. Project management involves planning, organizing, and overseeing the execution of a project, while code implementation pertains to the actual writing and testing of the code itself. Let's delve into how these two areas intertwine to lead to successful project outcomes.  One of the primary roles of project management in code implementation is to define clear project objectives and scope. Project managers work closely with stakeholders to gather requirements and set realistic goals for the coding project. By having a well-defined scope, development teams can focus their efforts on delivering the required functionality within the set timeline and budget. This initial phase sets the foundation for smooth code implementation, as developers have a clear understanding of what needs to be achieved.  Once the project scope is established, project managers allocate resources effectively. This includes assigning tasks to developers based on their expertise, setting up timelines for each phase of development, and ensuring that the necessary tools and technologies are in place. By managing resources efficiently, project managers help streamline the code implementation process and prevent delays caused by resource shortages or misalignment.  Communication is another key aspect where project management shines in code implementation. Project managers act as a bridge between the development team and stakeholders, ensuring that all parties are informed of the project's progress. Regular status updates, meetings, and reports help maintain transparency and alignment throughout the coding project. Effective communication channels prevent misunderstandings, ensure feedback is promptly addressed, and facilitate quick decision-making when unexpected challenges arise during code implementation.  Risk management is a critical function that project managers undertake to ensure smooth code implementation. Identifying potential risks early on, such as changes in requirements, technical issues, or resource constraints, allows project managers to proactively mitigate these risks. Contingency plans are put in place to address any unforeseen circumstances that may impact the coding project, helping to minimize disruptions and keep the development process on track.  Quality assurance is an integral part of project management in code implementation. Project managers work closely with quality assurance teams to define testing strategies, set quality standards, and monitor the testing process. By ensuring that the code undergoes rigorous testing before deployment, project managers help maintain the integrity and reliability of the final product. Quality assurance measures also help identify and rectify any bugs or issues early in the development cycle, saving time and resources in the long run.  Effective project management in code implementation also involves adapting to changes and continuous improvement. Agile project management methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, promote flexibility and responsiveness to changing requirements. Project managers collaborate with development teams to embrace iterative development, where code is implemented in incremental stages with regular feedback loops. This adaptive approach allows for faster delivery of features, improved responsiveness to customer needs, and enhanced collaboration within the development team.  In conclusion, project management plays a pivotal role in ensuring the successful implementation of code in software development projects. By defining clear objectives, allocating resources efficiently, promoting communication, managing risks, ensuring quality assurance, and embracing agility, project managers create a conducive environment for developers to thrive. The seamless integration of project management practices with code implementation leads to efficient project delivery, satisfied stakeholders, and high-quality software products that meet user expectations.""","652"
"309","""Question The objective of this assignment is to investigate the determinants of examination results. To do so, we are given data that contains observations on econometrics students' survey responses, across The C value in table., 4.3999 shows the average mark in first year statistics by students when zero. The coefficient of ATTR, b =.02263%. This is means that there is a.02263% increase in the mark obtained for every % proportion of revision lectures attended. The t-statistic of the coefficient of ATTR is, the null hypothesis H: Question The coefficient of attr,.05/8949 shows that the average mark will increase by.05/8949% with every % point increase in proportion of revision lectures therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, H: =, as compared to the t-Statistic in table. where we are not able to reject the null hypothesis. This shows that the attr coefficient in the multivariate regression model is now significant, having the additional variables, ability and hrsqt. At % significance level, critical value =.6 of At % significance level, critical value = F-statistic = 2.1029 Since F-statistic, we reject the null hypothesis H. From table., we can see that we have observed an event which occurs with a probability. should also therefore, reject H. Question I have ran a regression based on hrsqt divided into three subsamples, between and hours a more than hours a less than Coefficient of year2002, -.03399 is the proportionate change in student in year 002 relative to student in year 004. Coefficient of year2003, -.95/8910 is the proportionate change in student in year 003 relative to student in year 004. T-test for year2002 At % significance level, critical value = T-statistic = -.92496 We do not reject the null hypothesis as the test statistic of coefficient constancy across the three subsamples Restricted model: Unrestricted model: Where, d = Therefore, Where, Therefore, we reject the null and this shows that there is structural inconsistency and that it is better to split samples into subsamples than to estimate observations together. Question Null hypothesis that the slope coefficients in the model in question4 are constant across the three regression equations However, as we are testing that the slope coefficients in this model are constant, we use the regression ran on the two dummy variables 002 and Model: Unrestricted model is the same as Question Where Therefore, This shows that we accept the null hypothesis and that the model is structurally stable. The slope coefficients are the same for all three years. Question At this stage of the work, we have collected some important statistical information about the relationship between the dependent variable, qtmark, and its hypothetical determinants, the independent variables. To do so, I have created several models for varying independent variables and sometimes even adding dummy variables to identify significance levels. The previous results will facilitate the next task that is to try and create a model which includes the independent variables that have a strong influence on exam performance. To formulate such a model, all the independent variables included will have to be strongly significant, not only independently but also jointly. We should also take into account the value of the coefficient of explained by that model. We have looked at a number of variables and they include attr, ability, hrsqt, attc and alevelsa. From previous questions, I have learnt that attr is a significant variable to qtmark. Thereby, at this point, the explanatory variable that my model shall definitely include is attr. The high between ability and qtmark could be a sufficient reason for also including ability into the model. This sufficient reason to include it as well in the model is reinforced by the conclusions of the experiment made by Romer about whether students should attend classes. I went on and analysed the variables, attc and alevelsa in question and found out that they are both significant as we are able to reject the, the t-prob of variables are very close to the null of insignificance for the dummy variable is also rejected at a % significance level. Again, the t-prob of zero in the F-test suggests we reject the null of joint significance. By looking at R values for both models, we may say that model in which I added the uk dummy a better one: while the independent variables in model A explains about 7% of the variation in performance, the independent variables in model B explains about 8% of the variation in performance, that is an increase of around.% To increasingly improve model C, we could think about other variables that may also affect the outcome of exam performance. As Romer's experiment suggested a higher quality of instruction may encourage students to attend more classes and by doing that, increasing their chances to improve exam performance. Such a variable could be treated as a dummy: it would take the value for good quality of instruction and zero otherwise, where a good quality instruction is one that successfully gets students to attend classes.""","""Determinants of examination results""","1016","""Examination results are influenced by a myriad of factors that can significantly impact a student's performance. Understanding these determinants is crucial in creating an environment that fosters academic success. From intrinsic characteristics to external variables, various elements play a role in shaping examination outcomes. Let's delve into the key determinants of examination results and explore how they can be managed to enhance student achievement.  One of the fundamental determinants of examination results is the level of preparation. Adequate preparation involves consistent studying, effective time management, and practicing past papers. Students who allocate sufficient time to revise and understand the material are more likely to perform well in exams. Procrastination and lack of a structured study plan can hamper a student's ability to grasp concepts thoroughly, leading to subpar results.  Moreover, the learning environment significantly impacts examination outcomes. Factors such as classroom size, teacher-student interaction, and access to educational resources play a crucial role in shaping student performance. A supportive and conducive learning environment where students feel motivated and engaged fosters better academic results. Conversely, overcrowded classrooms, lack of individual attention, or inadequate learning materials can hinder a student's ability to excel in exams.  Another determinant of examination results is the quality of teaching. Skilled and experienced educators who employ effective teaching methods can positively influence student learning outcomes. Teachers who inspire, motivate, and provide clear explanations help students grasp complex concepts and perform well in assessments. Conversely, ineffective teaching methods, lack of subject expertise, or poor communication can impede student progress and negatively impact examination results.  In addition to preparation, learning environment, and teaching quality, individual factors also play a significant role in determining examination outcomes. Factors such as motivation, mindset, and self-discipline can greatly influence how well a student performs in exams. Students who are intrinsically motivated, have a growth mindset, and exhibit self-discipline are more likely to overcome challenges, persevere through difficulties, and achieve academic success.  Furthermore, external factors such as family support, socio-economic background, and peer influence can impact examination results. A supportive family environment that values education, provides emotional encouragement, and facilitates a conducive study space can positively influence a student's performance. On the other hand, students facing challenges such as financial constraints, family issues, or peer pressure may find it harder to focus on their studies and excel in exams.  Additionally, individual learning styles and preferences also play a role in determining examination results. Some students may excel in traditional written exams, while others may perform better in practical assessments or verbal presentations. Understanding students' unique learning styles and tailoring teaching and assessment methods to accommodate these differences can enhance their performance in exams.  In conclusion, examination results are influenced by a multitude of determinants ranging from preparation and learning environment to teaching quality, individual factors, and external influences. By addressing these determinants effectively, educators, policymakers, and parents can create an environment that nurtures student success and promotes positive academic outcomes. Encouraging students to develop good study habits, supporting their individual needs, and fostering a conducive learning environment are essential steps towards improving examination results and empowering students to achieve their full potential.""","624"
"56","""Now moving on to the exciting developments in our wonderful field over the last decade. My area of interest is still functions of a real variable and Fourier's discovery that arbitrary functions can be represented in series of sines and cosines is, in my opinion, a magnificent piece of mathematics. We are living in an interesting time for mathematics and I feel our profession is really taking off. My advice to you would be to continue your work on pure mathematics but also consider applied mathematics which the French are becoming more concerned with. Base yourself in France if you can as I feel the focus of mathematics is shifting there. Continuity is an intriguing subject at the moment. Cauchy has given us his definition although only for continuity at an interval, not on a point - something you could consider perhaps. I have a reservation about one piece of Cauchy's work however. Abel commented in 826 that there were flaws in his binomial theorem and described it as 'a theorem that admits exceptions.' Abel quotes the series as a counter example which as I am sure you can see from Fourier's work, is copies of the function y = x/ between - and and discontinuous at all odd multiples of. Perhaps Cauchy does not think this relevant to his theorem or possibly he is only considering continuity on an interval, in which case the theorem is right. Cauchy uses this binomial theorem to prove that with his belief that if you have a series of continuous functions then the series defines a continuous function. I advise you to have a look at this. The genius of Cauchy can be seen in not only the rigour he has brought to mathematics, but also what I think is the most significant mathematical development of recent years. Cauchy has destroyed the foundations of Lagrangian calculus. He discovered that Lagrange had used a flawed argument at the start of his account that every function admits a Taylor series expansion. Cauchy was more careful and restricted it to functions which, with their first n derivatives, are continuous within the interval. Previously we mathematicians thought our task was to capture the fact that every function could be expanded as a Taylor series in the most rigorous way. Cauchy has shown that it is possible to define a function that does not agree as a Taylor series. He uses the example. This is not identical to zero, but all terms of its Taylor series are zero. Cauchy has given us the question of how, if at all, can a function agrees with a representation of it. Think about this and its possible ramifications for Fourier series. It is something I will be working on. I urge you to have a close look at Crelle's journal, the first of its kind in Germany and an example of mathematicians trying to raise the standards in that country. You will be fascinated by Abel's work on the solvability of equations by radicals. Did you know he has succeeded in showing that the general polynomial equation of degree cannot be solvable by radicals? Look at the exceptional changes in our field in recent times and enjoy this mathematical age we are living in.""","""Mathematical developments and theories""","626","""Mathematics, often referred to as the """"queen of the sciences,"""" is a field that has seen constant evolution and development over the centuries. From ancient civilizations laying the groundwork for arithmetic and geometry to the modern-day intricacies of calculus and algebra, mathematics has continually pushed the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding.  One of the earliest significant mathematical developments was the concept of numbers. Dating back over 20,000 years, early humans used tally marks to count and keep track of quantities. This eventually evolved into number systems, with the Babylonians introducing the base-60 system and the Egyptians using hieroglyphs to represent numbers. The ancient Greeks furthered mathematical theory with Euclid's """"Elements,"""" which laid the foundation for geometry and number theory.  Fast forward to the 17th century, and the dawn of calculus revolutionized mathematics. Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed calculus to understand motion and change, leading to breakthroughs in physics and engineering. The field of algebra also saw significant advancements during this time, with Pierre de Fermat and René Descartes developing analytic geometry and laying the groundwork for modern algebraic concepts.  The 19th and 20th centuries saw a surge in mathematical development, with the advent of set theory, probability theory, and group theory. Georg Cantor's work on infinite sets challenged traditional views of mathematics, while mathematicians like Carl Friedrich Gauss and Bernhard Riemann made significant contributions to number theory and analysis. Meanwhile, the 20th century witnessed the rise of mathematical logic and its applications in computer science, thanks to luminaries like Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing.  Today, mathematics continues to evolve with the exploration of complex systems, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. The development of chaos theory and fractals has provided insights into seemingly random phenomena, while number theorists tackle age-old problems like the Riemann Hypothesis. In the realm of applied mathematics, mathematicians are instrumental in modeling climate change, optimizing resource distribution, and developing algorithms for machine learning.  Theoretical developments in mathematics have not only expanded our understanding of the universe but also revolutionized countless fields, from physics and biology to economics and sociology. The beauty of mathematics lies in its ability to provide precise answers to abstract questions, guiding us in unraveling the mysteries of the universe and shaping the world around us.  In conclusion, mathematical developments and theories have played a crucial role in shaping human civilization and advancing knowledge across disciplines. The intricate tapestry of mathematical concepts, from the ancient origins of numbers to the cutting-edge research of today, underscores the enduring importance of this field in unraveling the secrets of the cosmos and empowering human progress.""","535"
"323","""During my time studying here, at L'Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, I have come into contact with undoubtedly one of the most gifted mathematicians of our time, Augustin-Louis Cauchy. Through his lectures and published work I have been given a valuable insight into many new and exciting developments in the theory of functions of a real variable. Cauchy believes that mathematical work should be rigorous, and has been instrumental in raising the general expectation of how mathematics should be presented. The mathematical community here no longer just want to see solutions to problems; they also want strong evidence that the proposed solutions will actually hold. Cauchy, especially, is not happy with the way key concepts were defined in the past, so has tried to refine them, giving them a much higher level of precision. Take, for example, his definition of the indefinite integral, found in his Resume of 823. Previously we have assumed the existence of the indefinite integral in order to derive the definite integral using the fundamental law of the calculus. Instead Cauchy reverts back to the way Leibniz originally regarded the indefinite integral as the sum of infinitesimal elements. He makes this formulation more precise, ending up with y = f constant. He is not afraid to break with what is regarded as common practice in order to build on past ideas. I respect him greatly for this since the only way mathematicians will make breakthroughs is by being prepared to think differently. This does not mean that Cauchy's work is infallible or indeed totally rigorous. There are some inconsistencies in the quality of his work. In lectures he has shown many of his ideas on the concept of continuity, a major topic, including a proof of the Mean Value which does not agree with the expansion of its Taylor series. This contradicts Lagrange's claim that every function can be expanded in a Taylor series, on which he based his whole concept of the calculus. Although others, including Ampere (another lecturer here at L'Ecole Polytechnique), have questioned if Lagrange's argument was entirely correct, they have still sought to prove that functions are infinitely differentiable and admit a Taylor series. Hence Cauchy's work is a revelation. It has disproved something which has been assumed to be correct for so long, and has left people perhaps questioning the validity of previously concrete principles, wondering if they too could admit exceptions. Cauchy has given us much stronger foundations on which to base our ideas of the calculus in future years. Having experienced many of his revolutionary ideas first hand, it has had a profound effect on the way I will structure my own work in the future; his meticulous approach is something every mathematician should try to emulate.""","""Cauchy and mathematical rigor""","548","""Augustin-Louis Cauchy was a prominent French mathematician who made significant contributions to analysis, mathematical physics, and engineering. Born in 1789, Cauchy played a key role in shaping the development of calculus and laying the foundations of modern mathematical rigor. His work emphasized precision, clarity, and rigor in mathematical reasoning, which had a profound impact on the field.  One of Cauchy's enduring legacies is his approach to mathematical rigor. He believed that to truly understand mathematical concepts and to demonstrate the validity of mathematical results, one must adhere to strict logical reasoning and clear definitions. Cauchy was instrumental in formalizing the principles of calculus and making them more rigorous through the use of limits and continuity.  One of the key areas where Cauchy's emphasis on rigor had a lasting impact was in the formulation of the epsilon-delta definition of limits. This concept, which is central to calculus, provides a precise and rigorous way of defining the limit of a function. By introducing this definition, Cauchy helped establish a solid mathematical foundation for calculus, ensuring that mathematical results were proven with absolute certainty.  Cauchy's work also extended beyond calculus to fields such as complex analysis, number theory, and mathematical physics. His contributions to the theory of functions of a complex variable and his development of the Cauchy-Riemann equations are considered fundamental to the study of complex analysis. In number theory, Cauchy's work on Diophantine equations and Fermat's Last Theorem laid the groundwork for further advances in the field.  While Cauchy's emphasis on rigor was groundbreaking, it also met with resistance from some of his contemporaries. His strict standards and demand for rigor often clashed with the more intuitive and less formally structured approaches favored by other mathematicians. However, over time, Cauchy's commitment to rigor and precision became widely accepted and is now seen as an essential aspect of modern mathematics.  In addition to his mathematical achievements, Cauchy was also a prolific writer, publishing over 800 papers during his lifetime. His clear and concise writing style reflected his commitment to clarity and precision in mathematical exposition. Many of his works are still studied today for their insightful mathematical content and rigorous methodology.  In conclusion, Cauchy's dedication to mathematical rigor has left an indelible mark on the field of mathematics. His emphasis on logical reasoning, clear definitions, and rigorous proofs has helped shape the way mathematicians approach problems and build mathematical theories. Cauchy's legacy continues to inspire mathematicians to strive for clarity, precision, and rigor in their work, ensuring that mathematical results are well-founded and irrefutable.""","532"
"152","""The Treaty of Rome had the aim of creating a single integrated internal market back in 95/87. However slow progress throughout the years until late 970s, brought about a mission to complete the Single Market. The programme was initiated in 985/8 with the publication of the White Paper and the Single Market went into force in January 993. Here, the rationale of the Single Market will be explained as the objectives or reasons for its creation while the aims are the mechanisms which are used to achieve the particular objectives. The rationale will be outlined first and then an analysis of each of the mechanisms used will follow. First of all, a basic description of a single market is needed so that the discussion can proceed progressively. A single market is a customs union with common policies on product regulation, and freedom of movement of all the factors of still quite active. Nevertheless the elimination of physical barriers has led to an improvement in the movement of goods and labour. Customs formalities were simplified initially and then abolished along with border controls by January 993. In response to the concern about major crime in the EU a system of frontier-free police and criminal justice cooperation was created. Europol, the European police force, is part of that response. So is the Schengen Information System whereby national police exchange information on wanted or suspected wrongdoers. The elimination of technical frontiers basically means breaking down the barriers of technical regulations or standards on the factors of production, either by harmonisation or mutual recognition. Most of these regulations were based on different safety, health, and environment standards. Goods were prevented from moving freely due to the differences in the standards. The lack of mobility of labour and persons was due to the differences in, for example, immigration policies as well as pension schemes. With regards to movement in capital, this means removing exchange controls and any other restrictions. The European Parliament has pointed out that capital liberalisation should be backed up by full liberalisation of financial services in order to create a unified European financial market. This should encourage economic progress by enabling capital to be invested efficiently. An integrated capital market would also reduce the cost of equity, bond and bank finance and lead to a rise in Europe-wide GDP growth by. per cent. The idea was to create more competition in the financial sectors i.e. banks, insurance, and securities thus allowing a greater variety of investment products for consumers to choose from. As for other types of services, the differences in the recognition of professional qualifications among member states limit their free movement. In eliminating technical frontiers, there was the issue that member states were forced to lower their standards to those which prevailed in others. This was argued in the 987 case about Germany's import of beers hence producing a potential conflict between consumers' interest and the drive to remove trade barriers. URL URL McGriffen, S.P., 'The European Union. A Critical Guide', Pluto Press, 001, p.0. The removal of technical barriers has made an immense achievement in the movement of goods but to a lesser degree for labour. The Commission however is currently focusing on the services sector as this sector is seen to be the least progressive. Their efforts include more deregulation in certain areas for example to ease price-fixing by professional associations. A free services market should enable service providers to realise economies of scale more efficiently. The Commission proposed VAT approximation among the member states as one of the attempts to remove fiscal barriers. Member states had varying rates of VAT, between 2% and 2% in the 980s. Since border controls were to be abolished, it was essential to have little differences in VAT levels so as to make fraud pointless. However in Britain the approximation would mean the end of their VAT zero-rating of basic goods such as food and fuel. Also, the harmonisation of excise duties was argued to lead to lower cost of 'demerit goods' e.g. cigarettes. However, VAT differentials causes distortion of competition and thus an approximation was essential. Owen, Richard & Dynes, Michael, Guide to 992, Times Books Ltd, 989, p. 36. The Competition Policy made a great deal of contribution in the development of the Single Market. It aims to promote competition among businesses, having achieving it, will then contribute to consumer welfare as well as to the competitiveness of the European industry. However the authorities have not succeeded in dealing with certain areas, for example, the abuse in the car industry, in which cars are distributed through exclusive dealership networks, ignoring all of the normal competition rules and resulting in huge price differentials. It is believed that a more pro-active enforcement will assist in contributing towards increased competition and economic growth. However the instruments used such as antitrust, the control of state aid, merger control and liberalisation measures may not have a direct effect on competitiveness. That depends on the firms' own ability to compete. The Single Market has achieved substantial success since it was launched but there are rooms for improvement particularly in the services sector. It is also interesting to note that it is regarded as a stepping-stone in realising the conversion to the euro. Hence it plays an important role in assisting the EU to become the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy as set out in the objective of the Lisbon strategy.""","""European Single Market Development""","1062","""The European Single Market stands as a monumental achievement in the history of the European Union, ushering in a new era of economic integration and cooperation among its member states. Established in 1993, the Single Market aims to create a seamless and barrier-free trading area where goods, services, capital, and people can move freely across borders. This initiative has significantly impacted the economic landscape of Europe, driving growth, innovation, and prosperity for its citizens. Let's delve into the development of the European Single Market, its key features, benefits, challenges, and future prospects.  At the core of the European Single Market is the principle of the 'four freedoms' – the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. By eliminating barriers such as tariffs, quotas, and regulatory differences, the Single Market has facilitated cross-border trade and fostered competition, leading to greater efficiency and lower prices for consumers. Additionally, it has provided businesses with a larger market to expand into, boosting exports and creating jobs across the EU.  One of the key milestones in the development of the Single Market was the completion of the Customs Union in 1968, which removed customs duties and established a common external tariff for goods coming into the EU. This laid the foundation for further integration efforts, culminating in the Single Market Act of 1987 and the official creation of the Single Market in 1993.  The Single Market operates on the basis of mutual recognition, allowing products that are legally sold in one member state to be sold in all others without the need for additional testing or certification. This harmonization of standards has simplified trade procedures and reduced costs for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) looking to expand their market reach.  Moreover, the Single Market has also enhanced competition by preventing monopolies and encouraging a level playing field for businesses of all sizes. This has driven innovation and efficiency, as companies strive to provide better products and services to meet the demands of consumers within the Single Market.  Despite its many successes, the Single Market also faces challenges. One of the main issues is the lack of full implementation and enforcement of Single Market rules across all member states. Regulatory barriers, differing standards, and non-tariff barriers still hinder the seamless functioning of the Single Market, leading to inefficiencies and disparities in market access for businesses.  Brexit has also posed a significant challenge to the Single Market, with the United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU raising questions about the future of trade relations and regulatory alignment within the Single Market. The EU is now navigating the complexities of redefining its relationship with the UK while preserving the integrity of the Single Market.  Looking ahead, the European Single Market continues to evolve in response to changing geopolitical and economic landscapes. Initiatives such as the Digital Single Market and the Capital Markets Union aim to further deepen integration in specific sectors, harnessing the potential of digital technologies and improving access to finance for businesses across the EU.  In conclusion, the European Single Market has been a transformative force in shaping the economic development of Europe. By fostering trade, competition, and innovation, it has bolstered economic growth and prosperity for EU citizens. As the Single Market continues to adapt to new challenges and opportunities, its role in driving a more integrated and dynamic European economy remains paramount.""","657"

Children can be referred to as nodes. Binary tree may also have no links to any children. In this document the term node will be used. Each node can follow the similar pattern. So each node can form a subtree of it's own. The node which is at the top is called the root node. There are several types of binary trees, each with it's own property.

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These nodes are connected through edges, with the topmost node called the root. Binary trees are widely utilized in various applications like search algorithms, expression trees, and parsing trees due to their versatility and ability to represent hierarchical relationships.  Binary trees come in different types, such as binary search trees (BST) and balanced binary trees, each with distinct characteristics and optimal use cases. A binary search tree is a type of binary tree where the left child of a node contains values less than the node's value, and the right child contains values greater than the node's value. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, making BSTs ideal for implementing search algorithms like binary search.  Balanced binary trees, such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees, ensure that the height of the tree remains balanced, preventing degeneration into a linked list and maintaining optimal performance for operations. These trees employ mechanisms like rotations and color coding to balance the tree, leading to improved search, insertion, and deletion times compared to unbalanced binary trees.  When developing software systems that involve binary trees, testing methodology plays a critical role in ensuring the correctness, efficiency, and robustness of the implemented algorithms. Test-driven development (TDD) is a popular approach where tests are written before the actual code, helping developers define the expected behavior of the binary tree operations and validate their implementation against these test cases.  Unit testing is essential for evaluating individual components of binary tree operations, such as node insertion, deletion, and traversal methods. By isolating specific functionalities and testing them in isolation, developers can detect bugs early in the development cycle and ensure the correctness of each operation.  Integration testing focuses on testing the interactions between different components of the binary tree implementation, such as testing the integration of node insertion and deletion operations within the tree structure. This type of testing ensures that the binary tree functions as a cohesive unit and that all components work together seamlessly.  Performance testing is crucial for assessing the efficiency of binary tree operations in terms of time complexity and memory usage. By subjecting the binary tree implementation to varying input sizes and workload scenarios, developers can analyze and optimize the performance of search, insertion, and deletion operations to meet the application's requirements.  In conclusion, binary trees are powerful data structures with a wide range of applications in computer science. Understanding the types of binary trees and selecting the appropriate testing methodology are essential for building reliable and efficient software systems that leverage the benefits of binary tree structures. By incorporating thorough testing practices into the development process, developers can ensure the functionality, performance, and scalability of binary tree algorithms in their applications.""","573"
"394","""Nowadays, teenage smoking is a common issue for most countries worldwide which draws upon a lot of concern. As tobacco use has been identified as a major preventable cause of premature death and illness. Each year about 40,00 people die in the United States from illnesses related to cigarette smoking and a great further number of deaths are attributable to second hand smoke. Smoking initiation usually occurs during adolescence, while the vast majority of smoking related deaths occur in middle aged and elderly people. Therefore prevention of smoking initiation among adolescents is a powerful strategy for keeping away much of the illness associated with tobacco use. To target for a right intervention control, it is important to understand primarily of the associated risk/protective factors in terms of influencing teenager's choice of smoking uptake towards to which also form the basis of this empirical research. Results showed that peer influence determines the strongest relationship for an adolescent to become a smoker. appendix Table Literature reviewResearch on the factors associated with youth smoking has been based on the following areas: ) Socio ) Behavioral ) Community is globally recognized for conducting health research and investigations. The survey consists of 7933 observations; the sample target is on US middle high who are basically from ethnicity be rejected and accept alternative which we have sufficient evidence to conclude that the explanatory variable is significant. Value lying within -.6 to.6 suggested that we don't have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis, hence the variable is proved to be insignificant. Critical P value must be less than % for the variable to be significant. Below we will examine the magnitude for each of the significant variables Overall, strongest influence which affects a teenage smoking uptake is among of friends influence. One close friend smoke will increase the risk of individual to become a smoker by 4%. Other results show that with one living people smoking at home will increase the individual susceptible to smoking risk by 9%. other variables found for those whose who are being considered as having a loss interested in who have a high each equally having about 4% chance of likely impact upon an individual to become a smoker. Weakly significant results found for two protective factors which are anti-smoking advert and school discussion of danger of tobacco use as it only tend to show of having about 4% and % respectively on reducing the probability of the teenage to be a smoker. Hence after testing each of the significance of these variables, we are going to look into the predictive power of the model which is how well the modelling fit the actual data. The conventionally computed R^ for measuring goodness of fit is of limited meaning in the dichotomous response models. As the independent variables can only be two binary numbers either Y is equal to or. All the values of Y will all lie on X axis corresponds to or on the Y axis corresponds to. It's meaningless to look for how well it will fit the model in regarding to what linear regression has used. Instead Eviews presented one better measure of goodness of fit for binary regression model which is the Mcfadden R^ also ranges between to. The more related to the higher the accuracy of the model. In our model the Mcfadden R^=.5/85/8204 this maybe because generalizing raw data is normally hard to obtain high accuracy and there's some missing observations. However in binary regression models, goodness of fit is not of primary importance. What matters are the expected signs of the regression coefficients and their statistical and /or practical significance. We will decide to take an analysis into the expectation prediction test table. To take a look into the upper table first, we will try to compare the estimated equation with the actual constant probability. We will set. as the success probability and probability lower than. will consider as a weak or unsuccessful probability. For the first two columns, Dep= refers to the teenager who is a non-smoker and Dep= refers to the teenager who is a smoker. 'Correct 'classification for a teenager being a non-smoker equals to the probability less than or equal C for dep= or the prediction for the teenager to be a smoker equals to the probability bigger than C for dep=. In this model, we termed it as correctly predicted dep= as sensitively and correctly predicted dep= as specificity. Overall we found that the model correctly predicted number of non smokers as number of smokers as 24 (accuracy rate is 5/8.4%). The move from the right hand side table of constant probability to the left of the estimated equation provides an overall predictability of the estimated model. In the constant probability it correctly predicts all the non smoking teenagers of dep= since it is 00% but incorrectly predicted all of dep= which is among teenagers who smoke. The total gain from the expected model improves the overall dep= by 5/8.4% while it worsens the predicted probability of dep= by.5/8%. Overall the estimated equation correctly predicts.2% better than the constant probability. The percent gain for the estimated equation is.2% better predict the outcome than the constant probability of 5/8.3%. The half bottom part of the table will be the compute expected number of y= and y= observations in the sample. It shows that the expected number of teenagers who is likely to be non smokers is 8782.9 and the expected number of teenagers who is likely to be smokers is 103.3. The total gain is about.2% and 0.5/8% gain over in the predictability than the constant probability model. We can conclude that the probit model is a better predicted estimated measured model. Finally to add into additional monitoring of the effectiveness of this model we run the goodness of fit test by Andrews and Hosmer- Lemeshow. We try to measure the H-L value, null hypothesis is that deviations between the expectations and actual observations are zero which means the model predicts perfectly. Rejection of the hypothesis referred that the models predicts poorly since the expectations and actual observations are actually derived. Chi squared critical region=0-, % significance level =,.5/8 = 5/8.0731 H-L statistics from the table= 2.649 <5/8.0731 P-value=.398>.5/8 Andrew statistics=5/8.119<5/8.0731 P-value=.177>.5/8 Since both of the statistics show that they are below the critical value and the p-value are both greater than.5/8, we can accept the null hypothesis which means that the expectations and actual observations will not derive, the model fits closely to the actual data at an acceptable level. ConclusionTowards the primary finding from our result, it turns out peer influence has the strongest risk impact on teenage smoking uptake. With living people who smoke is associated with the second most significant susceptible risk. Teenage who have a poorer academic orientation, do not process an interest in schooling are likely to be the third significant factor towards for smoking behaviour. Having a higher income is associated as the fourth potential risk. However the two protective factors anti tobacco smoking advert, discussion of dangers of tobacco use in schooling are only shown to be weakly significant and only have a small effect on reducing teenage smoking uptake. As a result policy implications may suggest that control tobacco strategies should be simultaneously working along with each other in order to generate a larger effect. Comprehensive interventions should placed upon on school education programs included helping students to identify the dangers of tobacco use, teaching for self control and refusal skills against negative influences. However the positive effects of these programmes are most tend to be short run and it will only be sustained when it is coordinated with community efforts such as promoting a healthy living environment at home, reducing accessibility for teenage among tobacco use, enforcing a stricter parental attitude among their children. Together with broad based community efforts in which individual negative attitudes and behaviors are targeted for change, continue promoting media interventions to convey anti tobacco smoking messages to teenagers, increasing prices for tobaccos can then actually led to a more substantial long term success in reduce youth smoking. From the result found, the target group should be mostly for high school than middle school students. Other than age, two other factors such as gender and races the teenage belong to are not significant towards to have a relationship with the probability of the teenager's smoking uptake. The former confound to what recent literatures have found whilst the latter is hard to conclude as statistics shown that American Indian have higher smoking rate than other races. Therefore we may suspect that there are factors other than genetics that affected this social group to associate with a higher smoking rate or it maybe associated with data errors that actually occurred to bias the result. Therefore improvement over the model towards future work should include to test for time series regression to check for the persistence significance/insignificance of the explanatory variables Since given limited amount of time for data collection, some of the variables have not been included, such as how the accessibility of tobacco correlates with individual smoking uptake, it is greatly recommended to be added into future research. It can be further enhanced if the reciprocal relationships between those significant risk/protective factors can be explored, all of which have important implications for policy researchers in developing for more effective youth tobacco intervention programmes in the future and tailoring to those who are most vulnerable to the risk.""","""Teenage Smoking Prevention and Influences""","1866","""Teenage smoking prevention is a critical public health issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address the complex influences that lead young individuals to start smoking. Factors such as peer pressure, media representations, family dynamics, and socio-economic status all play a role in shaping teenagers' attitudes towards smoking. By understanding these influences and implementing targeted interventions, we can effectively reduce smoking initiation among adolescents and promote a smoke-free generation.  Peer pressure is one of the most significant influences on teenage smoking behavior. Adolescents often feel pressure to conform to their peers' smoking habits as a way to fit in or be perceived as cool. Peer influence can be particularly strong during adolescence when teenagers are seeking acceptance and a sense of belonging. Schools and community organizations can combat peer pressure by providing education on the dangers of smoking, promoting positive peer relationships, and offering support to teenagers who are trying to resist smoking.  The media also plays a significant role in shaping teenage attitudes towards smoking. Portrayals of smoking in movies, television shows, and advertisements can glamourize the habit and make it seem like a normal and desirable behavior. Young people are particularly vulnerable to these messages and may be more likely to experiment with smoking as a result. Media literacy programs can help teenagers critically evaluate media messages about smoking and understand the manipulative tactics used by tobacco companies to target youth.  Family dynamics and parental influence are crucial factors in preventing teenage smoking. Research shows that teenagers whose parents smoke are more likely to become smokers themselves. Parents who smoke may unintentionally normalize the behavior and make it seem acceptable to their children. On the other hand, parents who are non-smokers can serve as positive role models and influence their children's attitudes towards smoking. Family-based interventions that educate parents about the risks of smoking and help them communicate openly with their children about tobacco use can be effective in preventing teenage smoking.  Socio-economic factors also play a role in shaping teenagers' smoking behavior. Adolescents from lower-income households are more likely to smoke compared to their peers from higher-income families. Economic disparities can limit access to resources and opportunities for young people, leading to higher stress levels and a greater likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors like smoking. Addressing social determinants of health, such as poverty and inequality, is crucial in reducing disparities in teenage smoking rates and promoting health equity among adolescents.  Schools can play a key role in preventing teenage smoking by implementing comprehensive tobacco prevention programs. These programs should provide accurate information about the health risks of smoking, develop students' refusal skills, and create a supportive environment that discourages tobacco use. School-based anti-smoking initiatives can also involve parents, teachers, and community members to reinforce consistent messaging about the dangers of smoking and provide resources for students who want to quit or avoid smoking altogether.  Regulatory measures, such as increasing the legal smoking age, implementing tobacco advertising restrictions, and raising tobacco taxes, are essential components of a comprehensive strategy to prevent teenage smoking. By limiting adolescents' access to tobacco products and reducing the marketing tactics used by the tobacco industry, we can create a more challenging environment for young people to start smoking. These policy interventions complement other prevention efforts and contribute to a broader societal shift towards denormalizing smoking and protecting youth from the harms of tobacco use.  In conclusion, teenage smoking prevention requires a multi-level approach that addresses the diverse influences on young people's smoking behavior. By addressing peer pressure, media influences, family dynamics, socio-economic factors, and implementing evidence-based interventions in schools and communities, we can reduce smoking initiation among adolescents and create a healthier future for the next generation. Public health efforts aimed at preventing teenage smoking are crucial in reducing the burden of tobacco-related diseases and promoting the well-being of our youth.""","736"
"148","""The landmark decision in Pepper v Hart to relax the exclusionary rule regarding the use of Hansard has received much comment and criticism. One must consider the advantages of using parliamentary material as an aid to statutory construction as it allows the courts to 'give effect to.the intentions of parliament.' Yet on the other hand there are huge concerns regarding the constitutional implications of the decision and it's affect on the concept of the separation of powers. Furthermore one must consider the financial and practical implications of the decision; increased time and expense inevitably linked with using Hansard is a disadvantage. One must therefore decide whether the advantages of using Hansard outweigh practical and political objections. Hart AC 93 Hart AC 93 at p. 2 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson Steyn, J., 'Pepper v Hart; a Re-Examination' Journal of Legal Studies, March 001 See White, 'Hansard's up' 36 Solicitors Journal 224 and Davenport, 'Perfection but at what cost? 09 Law Quarterly Review149 Pepper v Hart involved school masters from Malvern College who partook in a concessionary scheme which meant their sons were educated at one fifth of the normal fees. It was not disputed that the fees were a taxable benefit under s.1 of The Finance Act 976. However, the issue was 'what is the cash equivalent of the benefit?' This Phrase was defined in section 3 of the 976 Act. The school masters argued the 'cost of the benefit was the marginal cost to the employer providing the benefit' and was therefore nil. It was originally held as correct, yet the crown contended this and argued that the expense incurred in educating the taxpayer's sons was the same as a fee-paying member of the public. Their appeal was allowed. The issue was therefore placed before the House of Lords. Hart AC 93 Hart AC 93 p. The point of law presented to the House of Lords was whether or not the courts should relax the exclusionary rule and be permitted to examine the proceedings in parliament prior to the enactment of s 3 in order to firmly establish their true intentions. Seven Law Lords decided, in a: majority, that Lord Mackay dissenting 'The exclusionary rule should be relaxed so as to permit reference to Parliamentary materials where: Legislation is ambiguous or obscure, or leads to an absurdity The material relied on consists of one or more statements by a minister or other promoter of the bill and The statements relied on are clear' Hart AC 93 p.7-8 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson This decision has been both commended and criticised. It changed the role of the courts with regard to statutory interpretation and it is therefore important to study subsequent cases to examine its application. The decision in Pepper has been applied in a number of subsequent cases such as R v Warwickshire County Council. This case concerned the interpretation of s The Consumer Protection Act 987 where the words 'any business of his' were scrutinised. The court allowed reference to Hansard which clarified these words. This case and others, highlight the way in which the House of Lords intended Hansard to be used: It shows that the decision has placed the courts in a position to more accurately interpret the intentions of parliament. In Beckett v Midland electricity Lord Phillips stated that using Hansard 'immediately made clear what had previously been obscure.' Holland supports the use of Hansard stating that 'there are certainly undoubted advantages in making use of all relevant materials to interpret a statute.' Therefore both case law and academic writing highlight that there is support for the argument that the courts should not 'blind themselves to a clear indication of what parliament intended.'

There have been questions raised as to exactly when reference to Hansard should be permitted, what an ambiguity is and how clear the explanatory ministerial statement must be. In R v Secretary of state their lordships refined the rule, agreeing that 'resort to Hansard as an aid to interpretation is the exception rather than the rule.' Peacock,J who refers to the judgement of Lord Browne-Wilkinson as 'deeply flawed' supports this approach, stating that the courts should 'treat the development in Pepper as a limited exception to the rule.' This cautious approach is extended further by Lord Browne-Wilkinson who refined his own decision in Melluish v BMI warning against over-use of Hansard and stating that the ministerial statement must be 'directed at the very point of litigation.' It was the case of Wilson which most 'tamed and muted' the decision in Pepper. This case refined the decision so that it is now to be read in a narrow way; it essentially accepts that the parliamentary context of the legislation is of use, but direct ministerial statements should not be accepted as law. See Sheppard v Commissioners of Inland Revenue, Lexis Transcript per Aldous J R v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the WLR 5/8, HL Ingman, T., The English Legal Process, 0th Edition, Oxford university Press, 004 p 94 Peacock, J., 'Flawed decision - the basis of the decision in Pepper v Hart' 0. BMI WLR 30 BMI WLR 30 Wilson v First County Trust Ltd AC 16 Kavanagh, A., 'Pepper v Hart and matters of Constitutional Principle' Law Quarterly Review 005/8, 21, 8-22 Hart AC 93 It has been argued by some that the decision to relax the exclusionary rule raises 'serious constitutional objections.' Lord Steyn suggests that an individual's statement cannot 'represent the intentions of parliament i.e. both houses.' This is an important point to consider. It has been taken to a further extent, some arguing that ministers may make deliberate statements which can be referred to in later litigation. Lord Steyn describes this as 'a constitutional shift in power from parliament to ministers.' This has serious implications as parliament are the supreme law making body in the UK and if individual ministers are able to use the relaxation of the exclusionary rule to have more influence over the law then the constitution is threatened. The decision in Pepper blurs the lines between parliament and the judiciary, thus disturbing Montesquieu's concept of the separation of powers. Kavanagh is deeply critical of this effect has on the constitution and commends the decision in Wilson. Steyn, J., 'Pepper v Hart; a Re-Examination' Journal of Legal Studies, March 001 Steyn, J., 'Pepper v Hart; a Re-Examination' Journal of Legal Studies, March 001 Marshall, G., 'Hansard and the Interpretation of statutes' in Oliver, D., and Drewry, G., The Law and Parliament, Butterworths, 998 Steyn, J., 'Pepper v Hart; a Re-Examination' Journal of Legal Studies, March 001 Wilson v First County Trust Ltd AC 16 One must also consider that use of Hansard may result in 'an immense increase in.cost of litigation.' It is clear that using Hansard makes litigation a more lengthy and consequently more expensive process. This has social implications which may restrict access to justice to those who cannot afford the cost of lengthy litigation. Davenport points out that 'The cost of legal services is largely governed by the length of time occupied in providing them. Will clients really have confidence in the legal system if they see such items on their bill?' The accessibility of Hansard must also be considered: White suggests that 'apart from those in London, it is highly unlikely that Hansard will be readily available.' Therefore, the decision in Pepper has social implications. If use of Hansard is to be limited by access and cost of litigation it does not deliver the justice it is supposed to. Lord Steyn refers to use of Hansard as an 'expensive luxury' which 'has substantially increased the cost of litigation to very little advantage.' Therefore, the use of Hansard in finding justice must be juxtaposed against the practical problems it creates. Hart AC 93 Davenport 'perfection but at what cost?' LQR 49 at 5/84-5/85/8 White, 'Hansard's up' 36 Solicitors Journal 224 Hart AC 93 Steyn, J., 'Pepper v Hart; a Re-Examination' Journal of Legal Studies, March 001 Steyn, J., 'Pepper v Hart; a Re-Examination' Journal of Legal Studies, March 001 In conclusion, there are advantages of using Hansard. It is beneficial for a court to place itself in a position of clarity with regard to the intentions of parliament. One must however consider political objections to the relaxation of the exclusionary rule, which question the effect the rule may have on the constitution and the concept of separation of powers. The practical and financial disadvantages of the rule are also of some substance; increasing the cost of litigation may create the paradox that a rule designed to increase justice may actually prevent a part of society from accessing it. Whether we should follow Lord Steyn's advice to fully re-examine the case remains to be seen. For the instance therefore, we must trust the courts to use their discretion, as shown in cases such as Wilson, ensuring that the rule is not taken too far. Wilson v First County Trust Ltd AC 16""","""Pepper v Hart decision implications.""","2033","""The landmark case of Pepper v Hart in the United Kingdom had significant implications for the interpretation of statutes and the use of parliamentary debates in legal proceedings. Decided by the House of Lords in 1992, this case introduced a new approach to statutory interpretation by allowing the reference to parliamentary debates as an aid to understanding the legislative intent behind a statute. The judgment in Pepper v Hart set a notable precedent, which has since had wide-reaching effects on how courts interpret legislation and has sparked debates on the role of parliamentary debates in legal analysis.  The Facts of Pepper v Hart The case of Pepper v Hart centered around the interpretation of the Finance Act 1976, specifically regarding a provision that allowed employees to receive tax relief on the cost of sending their children to independent schools. Mr. David Hart, a constituent of Sir Geoffrey Pepper, questioned the scope of this provision and whether it applied to the children of elected representatives. The question arose due to ambiguity in the language of the statute, leading to conflicting interpretations by the parties involved.  The Court's Decision and Rationale In its ruling, the House of Lords unanimously held that it was permissible to refer to parliamentary debates to clarify the meaning of ambiguous statutory provisions. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, delivering the leading judgment, emphasized that while the courts should generally rely on the wording of the statute itself when interpreting legislation, exceptional circumstances may allow for the consideration of extrinsic materials such as parliamentary debates. In this case, the ambiguity in the statutory provision warranted looking beyond the text to ascertain Parliament's intention.  Implications of the Pepper v Hart Decision The Pepper v Hart decision marked a departure from the traditional approach to statutory interpretation, which focused solely on the written text of the statute. By allowing the reference to parliamentary debates, the House of Lords opened the door for courts to consider additional sources of information when interpreting legislation. This approach aimed to promote a clearer understanding of legislative intent and enhance the judiciary's ability to apply the law effectively.  One of the key implications of Pepper v Hart was the recognition of parliamentary debates as a legitimate tool for interpreting statutes. While not every case requires resorting to such debates, the decision established that in cases of ambiguity or uncertainty, the courts could consult Hansard (the official verbatim record of UK parliamentary proceedings) to shed light on the legislative background and purpose behind a particular provision. This practice has since been accepted in subsequent cases, providing judges with valuable insights into the context in which laws were enacted.  Moreover, the decision in Pepper v Hart underscored the importance of promoting transparency and accountability in the legislative process. By allowing the consideration of parliamentary debates, the courts encouraged greater scrutiny of lawmakers' intentions and the reasoning behind specific statutory provisions. This added level of transparency has helped bolster the rule of law by ensuring that the judiciary can effectively interpret and apply legislation in line with Parliament's objectives.  Another significant implication of Pepper v Hart is the impact it had on legal practice and advocacy. The decision prompted lawyers to pay closer attention to parliamentary debates and the legislative history of statutes when preparing their arguments. Understanding the background and rationale of a law has become an essential aspect of interpreting and applying statutes effectively in litigation. This shift in approach has led to more informed and nuanced legal arguments, enhancing the quality of legal analysis in court cases.  Despite its positive impact on statutory interpretation, the Pepper v Hart decision has also raised some concerns and criticisms. One issue is the potential floodgates argument, where allowing the reference to extrinsic materials like parliamentary debates could lead to an excessive reliance on external sources and blur the focus on clear, concise statutory language. Critics argue that this approach might undermine the primacy of the legislative text and open the door to subjective interpretations based on individual judges' views.  Furthermore, the availability and accessibility of parliamentary debates for interpretation purposes have posed challenges in practice. Not all legislative debates are recorded comprehensively, and the process of searching through Hansard for relevant information can be time-consuming and onerous. This has led to debates about the practicality and feasibility of relying on parliamentary debates as a consistent and reliable source of legislative intent in every case.  In conclusion, the Pepper v Hart decision has had lasting implications on statutory interpretation and legal practice in the United Kingdom. By allowing the reference to parliamentary debates as an aid to understanding legislative intent, the case reshaped the landscape of statutory interpretation and underscored the significance of considering the context and purpose behind laws. While the decision has enhanced transparency, accountability, and the quality of legal arguments, it has also sparked debates about the potential drawbacks and challenges associated with relying on extrinsic materials in interpreting legislation. Overall, Pepper v Hart remains a pivotal case in the realm of statutory interpretation, shaping how courts approach understanding and applying the law in the UK.""","951"

The calculations suggest that in acetonitrile -pyridone molecule is more stable than -hydroxypyridine at HF/-/-1G level. DiscussionThe difference between the tautomers is that -hydroxy pyridine molecule is less polar than the -pyridone molecule. In the gas phase there is nothing to stabilise this polarity, and thus the least polar of the two tautomers is the most stable. This is shown experimentally and in from theoretical calculations. Once entering solution, the molecules can interact with solvent molecules to help to stabilise these 'partial charges' or the polarity of the molecules. The least polar of the two tautomers is affected least by this, and thus the stability of the two tautomers swaps. This is true in both cyclohexane and acetonitrile, a non-polar and polar solvent respectively. By increasing the polarity of the solvent, increases the difference in energy due to the extra stabilisation afforded to the more polar level of theory basis set used for geometry optimisation and energy calculation, ) The geometry difference in potential energies between the two isomers. Thus the ratio of trans to cis at room temperature is estimated to be::.00399 i.e. for almost 5/800 trans isomers there is one cis at room temperature.

On average MP2 is within -0% of experimental values, and the B3YLP are within 0-90% of experimental values. Dihedral AngleCompared to experiment the dihedral calculated at B3LYP level is around 0 out. The sources of error underlying computational calculations are ) the level of theory basis set used for geometry optimisation and energy calculation, ) The geometry optimisation (dependant upon the level of theory used and basis set). The SPE calculations performed a lot better than the pure B3LYP calculations. This is because it is a higher level of theory and the SPE used a large basis set. So here for the SPE calculation the main error is the geometry optimisation- which uses a small basis set and poorer level of theory than perhaps required for this type of calculation.""","""Solvent Effects on Tautomer Stability""","716","""Solvent Effects on Tautomer Stability  In the realm of chemistry, tautomers are structural isomers that exist in equilibrium with each other, differing only in the placement of protons and electrons. The stability of tautomers can be significantly influenced by the surrounding environment, particularly by the solvent in which they are dissolved. Understanding solvent effects on tautomer stability is crucial for predicting and manipulating chemical reactions in various applications, including drug design, catalysis, and organic synthesis.  Solvents play a critical role in stabilizing or destabilizing tautomers by affecting the relative energies of the tautomeric forms. This influence stems from the interactions between the solvent molecules and the tautomers, which can alter the distribution of electron density and the strength of intermolecular forces. Polar solvents, such as water or alcohols, have a greater impact on tautomer stability compared to nonpolar solvents like hexane or diethyl ether due to their ability to solvate charged species and participate in hydrogen bonding.  One of the key solvent effects on tautomer stability is solvation energy. Solvation refers to the process by which solvent molecules surround and interact with a solute, affecting its physical and chemical properties. In the case of tautomers, solvation energy can stabilize or destabilize certain tautomeric forms by modifying the free energy of the system. Tautomers that can form hydrogen bonds with the solvent molecules may experience stronger solvation effects, leading to a shift in the equilibrium towards the more stable tautomer.  Additionally, solvent polarity plays a crucial role in modulating tautomer stability. Polar solvents have a dielectric constant that facilitates the separation of charges within molecules, influencing the electrostatic interactions between tautomers and solvent molecules. Tautomers with polar functional groups or charge-separated structures are more sensitive to changes in the dielectric constant of the solvent, which can lead to significant alterations in their stability and population distribution.  Hydrogen bonding interactions between solvent molecules and tautomers also contribute to solvent effects on tautomer stability. Solvents capable of forming hydrogen bonds, such as alcohols or amines, can interact with tautomers through hydrogen bonding, affecting their relative energies. The strength and geometry of hydrogen bonds formed between the solvent and tautomers can influence the equilibrium position and stability of tautomeric forms, ultimately impacting the overall reactivity of the system.  Moreover, steric effects induced by the solvent can influence the relative stability of tautomers. Bulky solvents may hinder the formation of certain tautomeric forms by imposing spatial restrictions on the molecular structure, leading to a preference for more compact or less sterically hindered tautomers. Steric hindrance can impact the conformational flexibility of tautomers and alter the equilibrium between different forms, thereby affecting their stability in solution.  In conclusion, solvent effects play a significant role in determining the stability of tautomers by modulating their relative energies and populations in solution. Understanding how solvents influence tautomer stability is essential for designing efficient chemical reactions, optimizing reaction conditions, and predicting the behavior of tautomeric systems in different environments. By considering solvent effects in tautomerism studies, researchers can gain valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying complex chemical processes and develop strategies to control tautomer equilibria for desired outcomes.""","680"
"6208","""To look at the effects three different acids have on the freezing point of water. Through experiment the depression of water's freezing point will be studied and the results used to calculate the Van't Hoff factor for each acid and therefore the degree of dissociation of each acid. Theory:A colligative property is one that depends only upon the concentration of a solute and not upon its nature. The colligative properties of electrolyte solutions are more complicated than those of non-electrolytes because the solute dissociates into free ions and because the ions in the solution are then subject to strong interactions. However colligative properties can be used to give a rough indication of the number of particles present in a solution, and hence the extent of dissociation of an electrolyte in solution. The depression of a freezing point is one example of a colligative property. The depression, T = T fo - T f is proportional to the concentration c of the solution. When defined in this way T is positive. In the case of an electrolyte which dissociates into i particles when it dissolves, T is proportional to ic. Hence: k f is the molal freezing-point depression or cryoscopic constant for the solvent. For water, k f =.60 K mol - dm, but it is different for other solvents. i is the Van't Hoff factor. It is for non-electrolytes and for strong: electrolytes like NaCl which are fully dissociated into two ions. For a weak acid HA, with a degree of dissociation: For a solution of a monoprotic weak acid of concentration c and degree of dissociation, the acidity constant K a = 2c/(- ) 2c if is small. Different equations apply for polyprotic acids. Strictly colligative properties depend on the than the concentration or, properly it is.60 K mol - and Discussion: Concentration of CH3CO2H: Moles of NaOH titrated: One mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of CH CO H, so.05/8843moles of NaOH reacted with.05/8843moles of CH CO H..05/8843moles contained in cm.

The volumes of the acids and the ice and water were not measured accurately, the thermometer only read the temperature to. of a degree and there was a time delay between extracting each of the cm samples for titration. There were also inaccuracies due to the b-grade glassware used, and noting the end point of each titration. (iii) The calculated values of each acid give an indication of the extent of dissociation of each acid. CH CO H had the lowest value of.24, this suggests that it is a weak monoprotic acid, weaker than HCl and H SO because it only partially dissociates. HCl had a value of.13, suggesting it is a stronger monoprotic acid which is more fully disassociated. H SO had the highest value of.20, this would suggest it is the strongest acid of the three but the high value could be due to the fact that it is a diprotic acid and therefore can loose two protons per molecule and so would dissociate into a greater number of aqueous ions. (iv) Ka value and degree of dissociation for each acid: HCl is a strong acid and is fully dissociated so i =. The first stage of dissociation is complete so i = Second stage: My values for i are lower than the calculated values but they are in the same order for the degree of dissociation. The lower values may just be due to inaccuracies in my method. Molality of a solution of hydrochloric acid of concentration.000mol dm -, which has a density of.090g cm - or.090kg dm -. Molality""","""Effects of acids on freezing point""","932","""When it comes to understanding the effects of acids on the freezing point of solutions, a dive into colligative properties is essential. Colligative properties are characteristics of solutions that depend solely on the number of solute particles present, regardless of their identity. Freezing point depression is one such colligative property that is affected by the presence of acids in a solution.  Acids, when dissolved in a solvent, disrupt the regular crystal lattice structure that forms when a pure solvent freezes. This disruption occurs because the acid molecules interact with the solvent molecules, thus hindering the solvent's ability to form a solid structure. Consequently, the freezing point of the solution decreases compared to that of the pure solvent. The extent of this freezing point depression is directly proportional to the concentration of the acid in the solution.  The freezing point depression (∆Tf) can be calculated using the equation: ∆Tf = Kf * m * i, where Kf is the cryoscopic constant, m is the molality of the solution, and i is the van't Hoff factor. The van't Hoff factor takes into account the number of particles formed when the solute dissociates in the solution. For strong acids that completely dissociate, i is equal to the number of ions the acid dissociates into. Weak acids, on the other hand, may not fully dissociate, impacting the van't Hoff factor and thus the freezing point depression.  It is important to note that different acids exhibit varying degrees of freezing point depression based on their chemical properties. For instance, strong mineral acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and nitric acid (HNO3) tend to have a more pronounced effect on reducing the freezing point of a solution due to their high degree of dissociation in water. Organic acids, such as acetic acid (CH3COOH) found in vinegar, also contribute to freezing point depression but to a lesser extent compared to strong mineral acids.  The presence of acids in solutions is commonly seen in antifreeze mixes used in automobile radiators. Antifreeze solutions contain a mixture of water and additives like ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, along with corrosion inhibitors that are often acidic in nature. These additives help prevent the coolant from freezing in cold temperatures and also raise the boiling point of the solution, aiding in maintaining the engine at optimal operating temperatures.  In industries where precise temperature control is crucial, the knowledge of how acids affect freezing points is indispensable. For instance, in the pharmaceutical sector, certain reactions or processes require specific temperature conditions for optimal results. Understanding the impact of acids on freezing points allows for the manipulation of solution compositions to achieve desired temperature conditions, ensuring the success of these processes.  Moreover, in scientific research and analytical chemistry, the freezing point depression caused by acids is utilized in techniques like cryoscopy to determine the molar mass of unknown compounds. By measuring the freezing point depression of a solution containing the unknown compound and comparing it to a standard, the molar mass can be calculated, aiding in the identification and characterization of substances.  In conclusion, acids play a significant role in altering the freezing points of solutions through freezing point depression, a colligative property dependent on the number of solute particles. Understanding how acids impact freezing points is crucial in various applications, from antifreeze formulations in automotive technology to precise temperature control in industrial processes and analytical techniques. By delving into the intricate relationship between acids and freezing points, we unveil a nuanced aspect of chemistry that influences diverse realms of science and technology.""","719"
"424","""This report investigates the drag force on a cylinder using the method of pressure distribution around a cylinder. A circular cylinder was immersed in the fluid air, using a large low speed wind-tunnel, in the School Of Engineering's laboratory. Three different scenarios simulating turbulent as well as laminar flow, were investigated, and the factors which affected the drag on the cylinder were investigated. The importance of the Reynolds Number of the fluid flow was also determined. The report also investigates how to reduce the effect of drag on a body, and how the process of streamlining occurs and its dependence on the magnitude of the Reynolds Number of the fluid flow. It is shown that the drag force was found to be dependent on the flow pattern of the fluid and hence the velocity and density of the fluid the body was immersed in, and the dimensions and shape of the body itself. It was concluded that the drag forces depend on the flow structure in the wake formed at the rear of the cylinder. The wider the wake is, the higher the drag forces are. The wake is formed when the flow around the cylinder separates, and the point at which this separates is determined by the Reynolds's number of the flow, which is due to a combination of the size of the body and the speed of flow. It was also deduced, that in order to reduce drag forces on a body, its shape should be designed to be as streamlined as possible, because streamlining reduces the size of the wake, hence reducing the drag force.The total drag on any body consists of skin friction drag and form drag. The skin friction drag is a result of the viscous forces acting on the body while the form drag is due to the unbalanced pressure forces on the body. The sum of the two is called total or profile drag. There are several methods that can be used to determine the drag forces, including prediction of drag from wake measurements and from the pressure distribution around a cylinder. The procedure used during this investigation was to measure the pressure distribution around a cylinder. Flow over a cylinder is a primary fluid mechanics problem of practical importance. The flow field over the cylinder is symmetric at low values of Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, flow begins to separate behind the cylinder causing vortex shedding which is an unsteady phenomenon. The basic theory of fluid flow around a smooth cylinder dates back to nineteenth century hydrodynamics. The theory presented here predicts the velocity and pressure distribution about the circumference of a circular cylinder immersed in a fluid stream. The same theory predicts the lift and drag forces on the cylinder and can be applied to airfoils in modern aircraft and turbo-machinery applications. In the basic hydrodynamic theory for this experiment, the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible. The flow which is at a large distance from the immersed body is assumed to be uniform. The flow is also assumed to be irrotational. When the fluid encounters a smooth surface it is assumed to slip tangentially, owing without friction or separation; the fluid neither penetrates the surface nor leaves a gap. This condition is sufficient to yield a unique solution to the governing flow equations. This boundary condition differs from the more realistic 'no slip' condition applied to viscous flows.

Similarly, the x-axis in the approaching flow, the bottom surface of the cylinder, and the x-axis of the retreating flow is another valid streamline. These two streamlines are referred to as the stagnation streamlines and wrap tightly around the cylinder as suggested in figure. The Bernoulli equation is valid, for steady, inviscid, incompressible flow along a streamline, and will be used to evaluate the pressure distribution along the streamline that originates far upstream where flow is undisturbed.

Drag important parameter is the drag coefficient. It is a non - dimensionless parameter, and is the result of the drag force divided by the pressure and cross-sectional area exposed to drag. It illustrates that a characteristic amount of aerodynamic drag caused by fluid flow. The equation for the drag as follows Equation 2 Crowe, Roberson and Elger Engineering Fluid Mechanics th Edition John Wiley and Sons pg 86 The graph below shows how the drag coefficient for various two-dimensional bodies. Boundary Layer and Boundary Layer SeparationWhen a body is immersed in a fluid, near the boundary of the body, the velocity of the fluid changes rapidly from zero near the a relatively large value at some distance from the boundary of the body. This rapid change in velocity gives rise to a velocity gradient perpendicular to the boundary. Theoretically with invicid fluids, the fluid would just slide past the boundary and flow would be irrotational everywhere. This is however not the case with real fluids. There is typically a layer near a fixed surface in the fluid stream in which shearing stresses occur. This layer is called the boundary layer. A possible consequence of the boundary layer is that the main stream may 'separate' from the surface and form a wake downstream from the body. (See figure ). Apparatus and MethodApparatusWind-TunnelThe experiment was carried out in the large low-speed wind tunnel in the department of Engineering. The cross-sectional area of the working area of the wind-tunnel is approximately.4m x.7m. Pictures can be seen in appendix D CylinderA circular cylinder with a diameter d=13mm is mounted horizontally in the working section of the wind-tunnel. It extends from one side-wall of the working section to another. At about the central cross-section of the cylinder there are 3 static pressure tappings in its surface. The front of the tappings is aligned to the free stream direction. The rest are distributed at intervals. The thirteenth tapping is located at the rear. It is assumed that the pressure readings are the same for the bottom surface of the cylinder as the top pressure readings Multi-water manometer. The static tappings are connected to 3 adjacent tubes of a multi - water manometer which is used to measure the pressure at different points on the surface of the cylinder Pitot-Static Probe A pitot probe can be used in the wind tunnel to measure the velocity of the tunnel. The assumption made is that the static pressure is constant everywhere in a uniform free-stream inside the wind tunnel. This is a reasonable assumption considering that there is no pressure loss, therefore, no pressure gradient, in the system. However, the situation will be very different for measurements taken inside a wake behind a bluff body where a significant amount of pressure variation exists across the wake profile. In order to accurately determine the velocity profile in the wake, a pitot-static tube is used. The pitot-static tube, a sketch of which is shown in Figure a combination of the static tube and the pitot tube, it works in the following manner Equation 3 where V is flow velocity, is the density of the fluid, p stag is the stagnation pressure of the free-stream and p stat is the static pressure The probe is located in the undisturbed flow upstream of the cylinder and is connected to the manometer to measure the free-stream static pressure. It is also connected to a micro-manometer to measure the tunnel air speed. Wire MeshThis is mounted on the test section about diameters upstream of the cylinder. It is used to introduce disturbances into the flow and thus simulate the effect of a fluid with a higher Reynolds number, by increasing the free-stream turbulence. This results in triggering an earlier laminar-turbulent transition of the boundary layer on the surface of the cylinder. ProcedureThe first run of the experiment is conducted with the wire mesh securely inserted in the tunnel upstream of the cylinder, to insure conditions of turbulent separation, and with the tunnel at maximum speed. The pressure at the different angles is measured by reading off the levels of the water in each tube of the manometer. The results are recorded in a table. The tunnel speed is also read and recorded. The experiment is repeated two more times with the wire mesh removed from the tunnel. The second run is at full speed while the third run is at half speed.. Table of Results5/8. Analysis and Discussion of ResultsUsing values obtained during the experiment, the Reynolds number of the flows is calculated. By calculating the Reynolds Number of the flows, the boundary layer conditions of the flow can be determined. i.e.( whether the flow is turbulent or laminar) A. Reynolds Number Equation 4 Munson, Young and Okiishi. 'Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics' Fourth Edition. John Wiley and Sons. Pg 0.

However due to the high Reynolds number, the flow can be considered turbulent. C. Half Speed Without Mesh The flow here is laminar. B.GraphsAll the C p calculations, plotting of graphs and the integration to find C D were performed by a computer program that can be accessed online at URL.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cyl15/8 The graphs are shown below for each of the experimental conditions. On each graph is the theoretical ideal flow on the equation. A clearer version of the graphs can be seen in Appendix A-C The computer program CYL15/8 computes the 3 manometer readings with the aid of Matlab based on the equation to evaluate the pressure coefficient- With the aid of the graph, one is able to determine the value of theta at which the flow separates in each case. This is possible because when separation occurs, the flow pattern is no longer that of irrotational flow. In accordance, there are changes in the pressure distribution. That is, the experimental pressure distribution begins to deviate from the theoretical pressure distribution. Therefore the flow begins to separate at approximately Theta equals Full Speed with mesh -25/8 degreesFull Speed without mesh- 7 degreesHalf Speed without mesh- 0 degrees Separation usually occurs where the physical boundary turns away from the main stream of flow. Considering the flow of a viscous fluid past a circular cylinder, shown the diagram below The flow upstream of the midsection of the cylinder is similar to that of irrotational flow about a cylinder, except very close to the boundary surface. At this point because of a viscous resistance, a thin layer of fluid has its velocity reduced from that predicted by the irrotational theory. The fluid particles directly adjacent to the surface actually have zero velocity. (This is called the no-slip condition.) The normal tendency is for the layer of reduced grow in thickness in the direction of flow. However, because the main stream of fluid outside the boundary layer is accelerating in the same direction the boundary layer remains quite thin up to approximately the mid section. The boundary thick ness is usually defined as that thickness where the flow velocity reaches 9% of the free stream value U Upstream of the midsection the irrotational flow pattern shows a significant deceleration of the fluid next to the boundary, with a corresponding increaser in pressure. For real flow however, the deceleration of the fluid next to the boundary is limited because its velocity is already of viscous resistance. Therefore the fluid near the boundary can proceed only a very short distance against the adverse pressure gradient. The adverse pressure gradient is the increase in pressure in the direction of flow along the rear half of the cylinder. Once the motion of the fluid next to the boundary ceases, this causes the main stream of flow to be directed away or 'separated' from the boundary.Thus the process of separation is produced. The location of the point of separation for a cylinder depends on the character of the flow in the boundary layer. It may also depend on the shape and roughness if the body. The Reynolds number is also an indication of the onset of separation. For Reynolds number greater than 0, the entire flow field is dominated by relatively large viscous stresses that inhibit the development of eddy motion in the flow When separation occurs the flow pattern is changed from that of the theoretical flow. The corresponding changes in the pressure distribution occur. For flow past a cylinder, the slight change of the flow pattern next to the forward part of the body only changes the pressure distribution slightly. However in the zone of separation, marked changes occur. From the previous can be seen that the experimental distribution that is nearest to that of the ideal distribution is that of the turbulent flow at full speed. It also indicates that the average pressure on the rear half of the cylinder is considerably less than that on the front half. Thus a large pressure drag is developed, even though the viscous shear drag maybe quite small. This explained D'Alembert's paradox. No matter how small the viscosity, provided it is not zero, there will be a boundary layer that separates the surface giving a drag force. Compared to a laminar boundary layer, a turbulent one has more kinetic energy and momentum. Therefore the turbulent boundary layer can flow farther around the cylinder before it separates than the laminar boundary layer. Over the front surface of the cylinder the presence of the boundary layer affects the pressure distribution through two major ways. Firstly through viscous losses and secondly through a slight displacement caused by the retardation of flow within the boundary layer. Near the shoulder where the pressure gradient changes from being negative to being positive. The force due to pressure differences changes sign from being an accelerating force to being a retarding force. In response the flow slows down. Mathematically we could say that inviscid flow cannot satisfy the boundary conditions to real flow, specifically inviscid flows allow slip at the surface while viscous flows do not. Drag CoefficientsThe drag coefficients for all the flows are shown on top of the the appropriate experimental condition. The drag coefficient goes from.69 for turbulent flow to.6 for laminar flow. This is similar to the graph in figure. The drag coefficient suddenly drops from about. to. at a critical Reynolds number of approximately between and This reduction in C D at a Reynolds number of approximately is due to a change in the flow pattern triggered by a change in the character at the boundary layer. For Reynolds numbers less than flow is laminar, and separation occurs about halfway between the upstream side and the downstream side of the cylinder. Therefore, the entire downstream side of the cylinder is exposed to relatively low pressure, which in turns produces a relatively high value for C D. When the Reynolds number is increased to about, the boundary layer becomes turbulent in nature. This causes higher velocity fluid to be mixed in the region close to the wall of the cylinder. As an effect of the presence of this high-velocity, high-momentum fluid in the boundary layer, the flow proceeds farther downstream along the surface of the cylinder against adverse pressure before separation occurs. ( Figure ) Hence the flow pattern, i.e. delayed separation causes the drag to be reduced for the following reasons; with the turbulent boundary layer, the streamlines downstream of the cylinder midsection diverge somewhat before separation, and hence a decrease in velocity occurs before separation. According to Bernoulli's equation, the decrease in velocity produces a pressure at the point of separation that is greater than the pressure at the midsection. Therefore at the point of separation, and also in the zone of separation, the pressure is significantly greater under these conditions than when separation occurs farther upstream. Thus the pressure difference between the upstream and downstream surfaces of the cylinder is less at high values of the Reynolds Number, yielding a lower drag coefficient. Apart from being dependent on the Reynolds number, the drag coefficient is also dependent on shape as well as surface roughness. It must be noted however that the drag coefficient produced during this experiment is not the total one. This is because the drag force used to compute C D, is not the total drag force, produced. It is only one component of the total drag called the pressure drag also known as form drag. Usually the total drag force is made up of both the form drag and the viscous drag also known as frictional drag. However, because as discussed earlier in the theory sections, the viscous drag is associated with the viscous shear forces. But there are assumed to be no viscous shear stresses in the analytical model, so the total force that the fluid exerts on the cylinder is obtained by integrating the pressure force over the surface area A of the cylinder Streamlining- A method to reduce DragStreamlining is a method used to reduce drag. It reduces the extreme curvature on the downstream of a body, reducing or eliminating separation in the process. Therefore, the coefficient of drag is greatly reduced. It also removes the periodic formation of vortices. When a body is streamlined by elongating it and reducing its curvature, the pressure drag is reduced. However the viscous drag is increased because there is a greater amount of the surface of the streamlined body, than on the un-streamlined body. Consequently, when a body is streamlined to produce minimal drag, there is an optimum condition to be required. This condition occurs when the sum of the surface drag and pressure drag is minimum. It should be noted that streamlining to produce minimum drag at high Reynolds numbers will probably not produce minimum drag at low Reynolds numbers. For Reynolds number less than one, the majority of the drag of a body is due to the viscous shear stress on the wall of the body. Hence if the body is streamlined, the viscous shear stress is simply magnified and the C D may actually increase for this range of Reynolds numbers where the viscous resistance is predominant.. ConclusionsFrom the experimental data gathered, it can be concluded that when a blunt object like a cylinder is immersed in a fluid, the magnitude of the drag forces due to the flow, depends on a number of factors. Firstly, the drag force depends on the Reynolds number of the fluid. The larger the Reynolds number of the flow, the more turbulent the flow is. However, contrary to expectations, the higher the Reynolds number, the lower the coefficient of drag. At low Reynolds number flow, (Re< ), the drag is a function of upstream velocity. At moderate Reynolds the drag coefficient tends to decrease slightly with Reynolds number. However at high Reynolds is a sudden decrease in the drag force. This is due to the fact that a turbulent boundary layer, can travel farther along the surface into the adverse pressure gradient on the rear portion of the cylinder before separation occurs.This results in a smaller wake and hence a smaller pressure drag. Due to the fact that the drag force is dependent on the Reynolds number of the flow, it could be deduced that it is therefore dependent on a combination of the size of the object and the speed and density of the fluid flow. To reduce drag forces on an object, the flow must be made to separate as late as possible. This can be done by redesigning the object into a shape that is more streamlined. It should be noted however that there are limitations to streamlining. At low Reynolds number flows, streamlining can actually increase in the areas on which shear forces act..""","""Drag Force on Cylinder""","4236","""Drag force on a cylinder is a fascinating topic that plays a crucial role in various fields such as fluid dynamics, engineering, and physics. Understanding the concept of drag force on a cylinder involves delving into the intricate interplay between fluid flow and the geometry of the cylinder itself. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply curious about the science behind this phenomenon, exploring the factors that influence drag force on a cylinder can provide valuable insights into how objects interact with fluids in motion.  To begin our exploration, let's define what drag force is and how it manifests itself in the context of a cylinder moving through a fluid. Drag force, also known as drag or air resistance, is the force acting in the opposite direction to an object's motion through a fluid. In the case of a cylinder, when it moves through a fluid, such as air or water, the fluid exerts a drag force on the cylinder due to the interaction between the surface of the cylinder and the fluid molecules. This drag force resists the motion of the cylinder and is influenced by various factors, including the speed of the cylinder, the viscosity of the fluid, and the shape and size of the cylinder.  The magnitude of the drag force acting on a cylinder is determined by several key parameters. One of the most critical factors is the Reynolds number, which characterizes the flow regime around the cylinder. The Reynolds number (Re) is defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and is given by the formula Re = (ρVD)/μ, where ρ is the density of the fluid, V is the velocity of the cylinder relative to the fluid, D is the diameter of the cylinder, and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. The Reynolds number helps classify the flow around the cylinder as laminar, transitional, or turbulent, which, in turn, affects the drag force experienced by the cylinder.  In the case of a cylinder moving through a fluid, the flow regime can significantly influence the drag force. In laminar flow, characterized by smooth and orderly fluid motion, the drag force is mainly determined by the viscosity of the fluid and tends to be lower compared to turbulent flow. In turbulent flow, on the other hand, chaotic and swirling fluid motion increases the drag force on the cylinder due to the formation of vortices and eddies in the wake of the cylinder.  The shape and orientation of the cylinder also play a crucial role in determining the drag force. For a cylindrical object, such as a pipe or a rod, the drag force is typically influenced by its cross-sectional area, surface roughness, and the angle of attack relative to the flow direction. A cylinder with a larger cross-sectional area experiences higher drag force because it interacts with more fluid molecules, leading to increased pressure drag. Similarly, surface roughness can create more friction with the fluid, contributing to higher drag forces.  The angle of attack, which refers to the angle between the direction of fluid flow and the axis of the cylinder, can also affect the drag force. When a cylinder is oriented perpendicular to the flow direction, it experiences maximum drag force due to the formation of a large wake region behind the cylinder. In contrast, aligning the cylinder parallel to the flow can minimize the drag force by reducing the size of the wake and decreasing pressure drag.  In addition to the shape and orientation of the cylinder, the velocity of the cylinder relative to the fluid plays a significant role in determining the drag force. According to the drag equation, the drag force (Fd) acting on a cylinder is proportional to the square of the velocity (V) and is given by the formula Fd = 0.5 * ρ * V^2 * Cd * A, where ρ is the density of the fluid, Cd is the drag coefficient, and A is the reference area of the cylinder. The drag coefficient is a dimensionless parameter that accounts for the shape and surface properties of the cylinder, with lower drag coefficients indicating smoother and more streamlined shapes that experience less drag.  Beyond the fundamental parameters that influence drag force on a cylinder, researchers and engineers often employ computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental testing to analyze and optimize the drag characteristics of cylindrical objects. CFD simulations use numerical methods to solve the governing equations of fluid flow around a cylinder, providing detailed insights into flow patterns, pressure distributions, and drag forces. Experimental testing, including wind tunnel experiments and water tank tests, allows researchers to validate CFD results and study drag phenomena under controlled conditions.  The study of drag force on a cylinder extends beyond theoretical considerations and practical applications. It has significant implications in various industries, such as aerospace, automotive, marine, and civil engineering, where minimizing drag can enhance efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and improve performance. For example, designing streamlined cylinders for aircraft wings, vehicle bodies, and underwater structures can help reduce drag forces, increase speed, and optimize fuel efficiency.  In conclusion, drag force on a cylinder is a multifaceted phenomenon governed by fluid dynamics principles, geometric properties, and flow conditions. By exploring the factors that influence drag force, such as Reynolds number, cylinder shape, orientation, and velocity, we can gain a deeper understanding of how objects interact with fluids and the implications for engineering design and optimization. Whether studying aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, or structural dynamics, the concept of drag force on a cylinder remains a cornerstone of research and innovation in diverse fields, shaping our understanding of fluid-structure interactions and their impact on performance and efficiency.""","1105"
"406","""The graph below shows the daily prices on the New York Stock Exchange of the General Electric common stock from December 999 to December 000. This time series consists of 5/83 values. The series seems to fit pretty well the standard behaviour of a stock price series. The series appears to have a lot of local behaviour, with fluctuations around a local level and drift in level behaviour over the course of the series. While it appears that there might be a deterministic trend in the series with the stock price gradually rising over time, the graph seems more representative of a stochastic trend in the series. The path of the times series appears to drift gradually over time, returning to the basic level, which is behaviour associated with a stochastic trend. There is no clear evidence of a deterministic trend in the series - the level of the series does increase and decrease at points but returns to the general level. (ii) The graph below shows the returns on General Electric common stock from December 999 to December 000. The graph seems to be representative of a standard returns series. The time series fluctuates about a zero level, with the series fixed at this level and no indication of drift. The amplitude of the time series changes slightly throughout the series, which ma be a slight indication that there is volatility present in the series. (iii) There does not appear to be a deterministic trend present in the plot of log returns. The log returns are fixed at a zero level with no evidence of a change in level in the series, so there can be no deterministic trend where the log returns are increasing or decreasing over time. There does not appear to be a stochastic trend present in the log returns series either, as there is no drift in the local level of the series. The reason there is no deterministic or stochastic trend in the series is because the log return of the values has been taken. By taking the return of the series you are removing the effect of the previous value in the time series on the current value. Therefore the stochastic trend of the series is removed as the process of taking log returns de-trends the series. (iv) The plot below shows a histogram of the log returns with a fitted Normal distribution curve. The daily log returns appear to be distributed, although there is some evidence to suggest the returns are negatively skewed. The Normal probability plot of the log returns below gives a much clearer indication of the distribution of the log returns than the histogram. Although there are a few outliers outside the 5/8% confidence interval, the vast majority of the log return values seem to fit a Normal distribution fairly well, with most values within the 5/8% confidence interval and the plot reasonably fitting a straight line. The histogram and the Normal probability plot suggest that the log returns follow a Gaussian distribution. The graphs below show the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions for the daily log returns. In both the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots, there is significant evidence that the first lag autocorrelation is significant, after which the autocorrelation seems to die out and become random. The fifth lag also might be significant, although the low autocorrelation prior to that suggests that this significant value is probably more due to inherent randomness in the series. Overall, it appears there is some very low order linear dependence in the series. The graphs below show the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions for the squared log returns, to give an indication of the non-linear dependence present in the log return series. While the first lag appears as though it might be marginally significant, the quadratic dependence of the series quickly dies out. There is no clear evidence that there is non-linear dependence present in the series. Overall it seems as though there is some very short memory linear dependence in the log returns and no real non-linear dependence. A Gaussian random walk model for the data is If the log prices are a Gaussian random walk then X t = the basic time series plot, there seems as though there might be a bit of volatility present in the data. While the amplitude of the data appears to be reasonably similar throughout the series, there are a couple of periods where the amplitude is slightly smaller or larger than elsewhere. This can be seen again by taking the primitive approach to volatility and plotting the squared log returns as seen below. There is a period of low amplitude of squared log returns, which seems to indicate that there is volatility in the data. The evidence of volatility is not all that clear, although the amplitude of the series is considerably smaller in the middle of the series than at the start. This weak evidence of volatility is again shown by the structural volatility curve of the log returns below. The volatility in the log returns is not dramatic, but the Lowess smoother line suggests that there is some volatility following extreme high and low returns. The line is not smooth in the centre either, rising slightly, although this is removed by taking a lower Lowess smoothing parameter. The slight evidence of volatility is more evidence to suggest that a Gaussian random walk model is not suitable for the log prices. Since in that case the log returns should simply be random noise, they should have constant variance and exhibit no signs of volatility. The volatility present in the series seems to discount the possibility of the log prices being a Gaussian random walk. It also has an impact in terms of modeling the log returns themselves. The slight evidence of volatility casts into doubt that a linear model is the best choice for the series. Linear models assume constant variance throughout the series and do not represent volatility at all, so are suited for models with no sign of volatility. (vii) The table below gives the AICC values for all within the specified has the lowest AICC. This would suggest that an is the best choice for modelling the returns series. The calculated by maximum likelihood is: The also seems to be a sensible choice on the basis of the autocorrelation patterns found in the log return data. The model has a theoretical partial autocorrelation switching value and decreasing in value, similar to the pattern seen in the partial autocorrelation of the original log returns. (viii) If the model is an appropriate fit for the data, the residuals should be independent and Gaussian distributed. A histogram of the residuals from the fitted is shown below, along with fitted Normal curve. The histogram demonstrates that the residuals seem to fit a Gaussian distribution pretty well, although there is a very slight indication that there may be negative skewness in the data. This assessment is confirmed by the Normal probability plot of the residuals shown below. This confirms that the residuals do seem to fit a Gaussian distribution, with almost all the residuals being located inside the 5/8% confidence interval for the Normal distribution. In addition, the p-value for a Normal distribution fit is insignificant. Overall there is strong evidence to suggest that the residuals follow a Gaussian distribution. This would seem to indicate that the given above is a good model for the returns series, although other aspects of the residuals must be checked. In particular, the residuals should be uncorrelated, demonstrating no significant linear or partial autocorrelation. Linear autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation graphs of the residuals are shown below. Although there are some significantly high autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation values for the series, these occur well after the autocorrelation series has died out, and are much more likely to be the result of randomness in the data than any real dependence. Since no significant autocorrelation and thus no dependence in the residuals has been found, it appears that the residuals are indeed independent. This would again appear to confirm that the selected is a suitable one for modelling the log return data. Similar results are found by considering the non-linear dependency of the data in the autocorrelation plots of the mean-adjusted square residuals below. As with the linear autocorrelation analysis, the only significant values of non-linear autocorrelation occur after the autocorrelation series has seemingly died out. These results seem to arise more through randomness than actual non-linear dependence. Finally, it can be useful to consider the tests of randomness given by ITSM on a set of residuals. None of the tests give a significant result. Overall, there is little evidence of the chosen 's unsuitability for modelling the data. The residuals appear to be both independent and Gaussian distributed, suggesting that the is a good one. (ix) The Moving average term of the model could be left out, reducing the to the This new model has an AICC of 89.36 compared to the 85/8.76 of the. This would seem to indicate that removing the MA term has not made it a drastically worse choice of model based on the AICC criterion. The reduction in the model does not seem to have had much effect on the distribution of the residuals, with a Normal probability plot still revealing them to be fairly well Gaussian distributed. Nor does the reduction in the model appear to have had any effect on the linear dependence of the residuals. Both autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation graphs of the residuals show no sign of significant dependence outside of standard randomness. However, the autocorrelation graph of the mean adjusted squares of the new residuals shows that there is some short memory non-linear dependence present in the residuals. This would seem to indicate that the removal of the moving average term to change the into an has degraded the fit, since there is evidence that the residuals from the model are not independent. This would seem to suggest that the is not a suitable one for capturing the behaviour of the log returns series and the is a better fit. Similarly, an additional autoregressive term can be added to the model. The model can be expanded to produce an, A Normal probability plot of the new residuals again demonstrates that the expansion of the model has had little effect on the Gaussian fit of the residuals. Examining the linear and non-linear dependence of the residuals through autocorrelation plots produces similar results to those of the reduced model. There is no evidence of linear dependence in the residuals but the residuals demonstrate some evidence of non-linear dependence, although not as dramatic as with the reduced model. This would again seem to indicate that the fit of the model has been degraded by adding in the additional term - the to be the most suitable model for the data of the three models considered. There is a danger in adding in additional terms to the model without proper consideration. The best model will be one which is parsimonious - the model will include exactly enough terms to effectively describe the data but no more. Adding in unnecessary terms can make a model unnecessarily complex, describing the data itself rather than the underlying pattern. A model with a high number of parameters will automatically appear to explain a high proportion of the data but many of the terms will be irrelevant or insignificant and the model may actually be a bad fit for the data. The which has been fitted to the data, can be used to forecast sections of the series. The graph below shows a plot of the time series with a series of 0 predicted values working from the time 00, along with a confidence interval for the predictions. While the first two values predict the general pattern of a rise followed by a big fall, they are way out in terms of value, with the first value only just falling inside the 5/8% confidence interval for the predictions. Generally the forecast does not seem to have been that accurate, with the forecasted values dying out after the first values or so. A similar series of forecasts working from the time 00 shows a similar result. The initial forecasted values actually predict the series quite well before the forecasted values die out to remain at. However, several of the actual values of the series fall outside the 5/8% confidence interval of the forecasts. The same process can again be applied to the end of the series, forecasting 0 values beyond the end point at time 5/82. This produces the same results again, with only the first three or four forecasts being any good before the forecasts remain at a level, which is clearly not a good forecast for the data. Generally the forecasts based on the do not seem to be very good.""","""General Electric Stock Analysis""","2457","""General Electric (GE) is a renowned global conglomerate and a significant player in various industries, including aviation, healthcare, power, and renewable energy.

"428","""Since the late 970s, with the adoption of neo-liberal economic policies by US and UK, the world economy entirely shifted its direction. Practices such as free trade and deregulation policies became so widespread that they came to be known as 'The Washington Consensus'. Even the end of History, with the final triumph of Capitalism, was heralded. Hedge Funds, as will see below, are not in any way the product of neo-liberalism. They were, at least in their most recent form, much fostered by some of its facets, such as deregulation and liberalisation of capital flows, which were much aided by the coming of the Internet. But globalisation is not without its drawbacks. At this point, a parallel with taxation may be helpful, for at least some of the challenges Hedge Funds present are similar to those faced by regulators as to tax shopping before the enactment of transfer pricing rules - in that the dilemmas our issue presents can never be efficiently tackled solely from the perspective of a single country, even though regulation is intrinsically a sovereign governmental activity, not easily made compatible with a global strategy. In addition, the weighing of interest by government authorities in regulating hedge funds is far more convoluted than in taxation - where, at least theoretically, most problems could be solved by delegating all powers to a global authority who had powers apportion public revenue amongst states in much the same way a central government does with sub-national entities, so as to attain to the objective of fiscal neutrality as to investment allocation decisions. Conversely, not only do financial regulators of different countries compete against one another for the scarce liquidity that few economic agents apart from hedge funds can provide, they can do so only if the regulations they enact are neither so loose that they fail to protect against crisis, nor so draconian as to prevent maximisation of returns and discourage funds from doing business within their jurisdiction. Moreover, unlike taxation, those Highly Leveraged Financial only deliver nearly-stratospheric yields if they are allowed to exploit to the fullest, inter alia, discrepancies in time and is space that are entailed by the pursuit of diverse national economic policies, in a practice known as arbitrage in the jargon of the financial markets. To our imaginary Earth Revenue, tax havens would simply be banned. Conversely, hedge funds cannot do without them - as most their most common corporate structures rely on a tax-haven based parent company so as to benefit from lower disclosure requirements and tax rates. See FINANCIAL STABILITY FORUM - Report of the Working Group on Highly Leveraged Institutions, April 000, at URL, accessed April 007. Or, according to URL, an online financial glossary, in the corresponding entry, 'Attempting to profit by exploiting price differences of identical or similar financial instruments, on different markets or in different forms. The ideal version is riskless arbitrage.' at URL, accessed April 007. If taxation is the antithesis of globalisation - in that it depends on what divides countries - national sovereign powers _, instead of what unites them, hedge funds can only blossom in a globalised world such as ours. Moreover, financial authorities, unlike their tax counterparts, have little incentive to act in coordination while profit is being made, but have all incentive to join one another in action as systemic crises arise. Tax have as a condition rationality, for public revenue is for tax authorities what profits are to an entrepreneur, but the former are entirely contingent upon the latter. If each tax authority elected to tax all resources available, they would drain off all incentive of private players to make money. Besides, as the opportunities of making profit are limited in the national level, firms and individuals often go abroad. If countries cannot strike a bargain as between themselves, double taxation would remove all incentive from overseas activities. Therefore, countries have much incentive to negotiate alongside lines previously known to all in the form of the Model Conventions. Conversely, Hedge Funds need diversity to flourish by exploiting differences in currency and interest policies. As to Hedge Funds, is the reverse: in the event all countries adopted the same economic policies in all respects, there would be short of opportunities. HFs would never flourish under a Fiscal Leviathan, but would be in serious jeopardy under Hobbesian anarchy. National authorities the world wide must, therefore, strike a very delicate balance between their wealth acquisition and their conduct regulation practices, their need to combine occasional collaboration with their overseas counterparts without dismissing the competitive aspects of the interaction between inside and outside the limits of their territory, within and beyond the limits of their sovereignty. In this respect, as we will be analysing, US and UK authorities seem to have taken different stances in their approaches to hedge funds, with the latter being much laxer then former, with seemingly better results - at least up to now.

In fact, devising an ideal strategy, either municipal or global, for regulating hedge funds is no easy task, but it does give us much food for thought on new challenges of law and regulation of securities and financial markets and possible strategies that may be developed to tackle them, as this is time when long-established distinctions, such as private and public, hard law v. soft law, all blur, and the view of the state as a harmonious whole is no longer tenable, but a new supra-state is not yet born. We shall now examine how hedge funds were created. Hedge Funds:Definition, History, Operation, Techniques, StrategiesThe primary meaning of 'hedge' seems in straight opposition to the high degree of risk commonly associated with hedge funds - at least after the disastrous crises triggered by hedge funds Long Term Capital Amaranth - when the former was bailed out by the market, but not the latter. In many dictionaries, the first definitions of this world commonly have the sense of 'protection'.

Regulatory Framework in the UKIt seems to us that the expression 'regulation' in the title of this essay should be given a broad meaning if it is to be given a proper answer. Therefore, while analyzing whether a particular country is in position of curbing threats of financial crises, an overall view of the applicable law thereto will be required, instead of a quick look at current measures of the specialized regulatory agency, for ultimately a country will need the full force of its whole legal system if it is to sort out this crises, and even that may not suffice - for systemic crises triggered by HFs may assume gargantuan proportions requesting a global response by gathering regulators all over the world, all to act in a ad hoc basis in a very much impromptu way, responding to circumstances as they present themselves. Anyway, before we give a definitive answer, we should have an overall view the tools that the UK legal system possesses to carve out a solution. Including Bretton Woods institutions such as International Monetary bail out countries in distress. In the UK, the chief regulatory agency as to securities is the Financial Services the US, the Bank of England performing pretty much the same role of the Federal Reserve as the local central bank. Prone to a British tradition of self-regulation of the markets, the FSA is perhaps less rigid than the SEC, which is constantly involved in litigation with investors in judicial proceedings. The FSA refrains from regulating hedge funds directly, as most of these have their central management and control offshore, therefore outside the reach of its powers - whose exercise abroad cannot be required for other countries as it would amount to a denial of sovereignty thereto. Nevertheless, Hedge Funds normally keep permanent establishments in the cities where most of their prospective clients are located, mainly New York and London, therefore within full reach of local laws and regulations. US stance is in stark contrast with UK's in that, thanks to doctrines such as the effects theory, as well as blatantly extraterritorial statutes such as the FCPA, ATCA, RICO, and worldwide tax liability, an expression whose construction is entirely in the discretion of the Magistrate applying the law, who will ponder interests while considering the circumstances. Moreover, the crude wording of statutes such as the Patriot Act provides them with various opportunities to assert its jurisdiction to traditional hedge fund locations. In contrast, UK, even before being bound by EU laws, had always fare more modest long-arm statutes, and not much more than one big exception to extraterritorial rules _ worldwide asset freezing orders, once known as Mareva injunctions. It should be borne in mind, however, that much of what amounts to national regulations in finance are not in fact the monopoly of a single country. Countries have to comply with a great deal of soft law, such as Basel Rules, which most of them enact internally. As it admitted in official papers of the FSA, notwithstanding the fact that there are now roughly US$00bn assets under HF management statutes imposing on HF are the Financial Services and Markets Act various FSA regulations implementing legal rules, the Companies Act 985/8, the Open-Ended Investment Companies Regulations 001.

Capital Requirements, the 000 Act provides for a own-initiative power, which provides the FSA with considerable discretion in activity. FSA's own-initiative powerUnder Section 5/8. of the FSMA, FSA may exercise its power under an authorised person not only where he judges that is he is failing, or is likely to fail, to satisfy certain threshold conditions, but also, in a very broadly written clause, where ' it is desirable to exercise that power in order to protect the interests of consumers or potential consumers.' It may go as far as varying permissions already granted to UK authorised firms following acquisition of their control by foreign firms as well as, under Section 7. Most significantly, it may assist overseas regulators in respect of an authorised person. In that event, it must, while deciding whether or not to exercise that power in response to the request, consider whether it is necessary to do so in order to comply with a Community obligation. For that purpose, it may take into account in particular criteria of reciprocity. Besides, it nearly resuscitates the practice of the double actionability rule, as it excuses itself from cooperating if the practice does not constitutes a breach of law in the UK. It also cites non-recognition of the jurisdiction is not recognized by the United Kingdom, as if systemic crises would spare a market of the importance of the UK in view of diplomatic considerations. More understandably, the relevance of the case is a factor taking into consideration. Phrasing that it will 'consider the importance to persons in the United Kingdom' may appear reasonable, but shows little sensitivity to the current interconnectedness of financial markets. Public interest is by far the most acceptable criteria - as in some cases this may not coincide with the interest of the overseas regulators, being the interest of the British public whist abiding by widely acknowledge standards. Lastly, the requirement for previous commitment of undertaking contributions for the FSA to meet the costs of carrying on its action, without any exception, seems a bit unreasonable in the example of a request of an authority of a poor country whose market has a background of money laundering, as is the case of Burma. This seems to us an unacceptable parochial view in many respects. ConclusionFrom the very beginning it might have been tempting to state that not only UK's, but all national financial regulations inadequate to protect as to financial crisis, for the very simple reason that regulators are limited in their action to the limits of their territory and slow in their bureaucratic habits, whilst hedge funds are hectic and global. Besides, it might be contended that much of British 'unregulation' is a conscious policy, as the FSA is in fact striking a bargain with funds by allowing them a larger margin of freedom than the US so that it can reap the benefits of their profit maximization techniques. On the other hand, it is clear that, although the FSA does abide by certain virtually universal standards financial market regulation, an absolute uniformity of rules is in any way desirable, as might be the case as to taxation, for it would dry off various sources of liquidity for the global economy. In the present state, though, there is not much the UK can do on its own - except, perhaps, lobby for the development of a new global financial architecture whilst acknowledging for the differences between countries, and assigning them different functions by allowing them to enact alternative standards. In Westphalia, the Great Powers gathered an decided the Switzerland, which had not sent any representatives, should remain neutral. Surprisingly enough, not only it still is and is likely to remain as such, as it also has never had its neutrality violated. Perhaps the time for a new Westphalia has come.""","""Hedge Funds and Regulations""","4275","""Hedge Funds and Regulations: Navigating the Complex Landscape  Hedge funds are alternative investment vehicles that aim to generate high returns using a variety of investment strategies. These funds are typically only available to accredited investors due to their complexity and risk profile. Hedge funds are known for their flexibility in investment strategies, ability to go long and short in the market, and their use of leverage to amplify returns. However, as with any investment vehicle, hedge funds are subject to regulations that govern their operations, disclosures, and interactions with investors and the broader financial markets.  Regulatory Framework  The regulatory framework for hedge funds varies by jurisdiction, with the United States and the European Union having some of the most comprehensive regulations governing these investment vehicles. In the U.S., hedge funds are primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Hedge fund managers are required to register with the SEC if they meet certain thresholds for assets under management. Registered investment advisers are subject to regulatory oversight, including requirements around disclosure, reporting, and fiduciary duties to their clients.  In addition to federal regulations, hedge funds are also subject to state laws, particularly around the registration of investment advisers. States like New York and California have their own regulatory frameworks that complement federal regulations. The regulatory landscape can be complex and challenging to navigate, especially for smaller hedge funds or emerging managers who may not have the resources to fully comply with all the regulatory requirements.  Regulation of Investment Strategies  One key area of regulation for hedge funds is around their investment strategies. Hedge funds are known for their use of strategies such as long/short equity, global macro, event-driven, and quantitative trading. These strategies can involve complex derivative instruments, leverage, and short-selling, which can amplify both returns and risks. Regulators are concerned with ensuring that hedge funds are transparent about their investment strategies and risks, particularly as they can have an impact on market stability and investor protection.  Regulators may place restrictions on certain types of investments or trading practices to prevent market manipulation or excessive risk-taking. For example, the SEC introduced regulations like Rule 13h-1 to monitor large traders and prevent market abuse. Similarly, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees hedge funds that trade in commodities or derivatives markets, imposing regulations around position limits and reporting requirements to ensure market integrity.  Reporting and Disclosure Requirements  Another critical aspect of hedge fund regulation is around reporting and disclosure requirements. Hedge funds are required to provide certain information to regulators, investors, and counterparties to ensure transparency and accountability. This includes regular reporting of performance, holdings, risk metrics, and conflicts of interest. Hedge funds must also provide disclosures to investors outlining the fund's investment objectives, fees, risks, and past performance.  Regulators like the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have specific requirements for reporting by hedge funds and their managers. These reports help regulators monitor systemic risks, detect market abuse, and enhance investor protection. Hedge funds that fail to comply with reporting requirements may face regulatory sanctions, fines, or even closure.  Market Integrity and Investor Protection  Regulations governing hedge funds also aim to safeguard market integrity and protect investors from fraud and misconduct. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act introduced reforms to enhance transparency, accountability, and investor protection in the financial markets. One key provision of Dodd-Frank was the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from engaging in proprietary trading or owning hedge funds to reduce systemic risk.  Regulators like the SEC, the Federal Reserve, and the CFTC work together to oversee systemic risks in the financial system and ensure that market participants adhere to regulations that promote fair and orderly markets. These regulatory bodies conduct inspections, investigations, and audits to monitor compliance with regulations and detect potential violations.  Challenges and Future Trends  The regulatory landscape for hedge funds continues to evolve as regulators adapt to changes in the financial markets and address new challenges. One ongoing challenge is the global nature of hedge fund operations, which can make it difficult to coordinate regulations across jurisdictions. Regulatory arbitrage, where hedge funds seek out jurisdictions with less stringent regulations, can also pose challenges for regulators.  Technology is another area that is reshaping hedge fund regulation. Regulators are increasingly using data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to monitor market activity, detect patterns of misconduct, and enhance regulatory oversight. RegTech solutions are being developed to help hedge funds comply with reporting requirements and streamline regulatory processes.  In conclusion, hedge funds operate in a complex regulatory environment that seeks to balance innovation and risk-taking with investor protection and market stability. Hedge fund managers must navigate a web of regulations that govern their operations, investment strategies, reporting requirements, and interactions with investors and regulatory bodies. Compliance with regulations is crucial to maintaining trust with investors, safeguarding market integrity, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the hedge fund industry. As regulations continue to evolve, hedge funds must stay abreast of changes and adapt their practices to comply with regulatory requirements while pursuing their investment objectives.""","1008"
"3043","""The Chateaux Hotel Group was founded in 990 in the Chateaux Hotel Group is thinking about to open further properties in France. The country is situated in Western Europe and borders on Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Andorra and Spain. France offers a great diversity of landscapes including rivers, lakes, coastlines and sea sides, mountain ranges, rural areas and cities. France is a democratic country and has got an economy which is shaped by private enterprises and substantial intervention by the government in key sectors such as transportation and communication that, however, is state that: 'factors in the environment, the industry and the market will drive the enterprise towards one type of international strategy - either one that is fully global or one which makes concessions to localized customer needs.'Therefore, this paradigm is used to analyse and compare those factors regarding the broad environment of the UK and France in order to facilitate decision-making, planning and implementation of strategies for a business planning to enter a foreign market.. Political InfluencesBoth the UK and France are countries whose political systems are based on democratic thus, some of the political decisions are made within a shared framework and affect both countries to the same extent. So, for example the Treaty of Maastricht on European Union includes, among others, the principle of Freedom of facilitates the market entry for British entrepreneurs in France.. Economic InfluencesThe UK has one of the strongest economies in Europe. The service sector contributes the major part to the GDP and counts about two thirds of the total people aged 5/8 and that 'determinants are the economic, technological, social, cultural and political factors at work in any society that drive and set limits to the volume of a population's demand for travel.' Taking this as a foundation Middleton et al develop this idea further and identify eight major drivers of demand including economic, demographic, geographic; socio-cultural attitudes to tourism, mobility, government/regulatory, media communications and information and communications technology. They assume that these factors can be applied to all countries due to their universality and the fact that each country is exposed to the same external influences. There may be, however, one determinant more influencing in one market than in another one as well as the nature of a single driver may vary from country to country. For the purpose of this study Middleton's paradigm is applied in order to identify the drivers of tourism demand in France. Drivers of Tourism Demand in FranceThe main determinant for tourism demand in France can be seen in its diverse sceneries which range from coastlines and rivers, beaches and mountains, rural regions including vineyards to cities and culture. So, France provides a great variety of tourism and leisure opportunities. Also its temperate climate may be a driving factor for visiting France. However, technological advance and social-cultural shifts have led to a change in consumer behaviour and therefore, can be seen as the key factors supporting the demand for tourism. Technological progress is reflected in a dramatic increase in using air and land verify the company's competitive the assessment of the profitability. He argues that it depends on the single organisation and its mode of operation if it is successful and rather less on industry factors. Here it can be followed Stonehouse et emphasis that '. whether or not industry structure determines profitability, managers must understand the environment in which they operate to assist in the choice of strategy.'So even this paradigm has certain constraints it presents an analytical tool for scanning the microenvironment of an organisation. But it should be beard in mind that one force may have a stronger significance for one business than for another that markets and environments are more complex and inter- be seen as a potential substitute for the hotel. Moreover, a single European currency enables customers to compare consumer prices and in particular hotel rates more easily. This again could lead to the fact that they find well-priced alternatives in other Euro zone countries and eventually decide to spend their vacation there instead of France.. Threat of New EntrantsThe EU principle of Freedom of Establishment has lowered the entry barriers for companies of EU member states. So, a British entrepreneur wishing to set up a hospitality organisation in France is treated equally and not faced with any country specific regulations in terms of entering the foreign market. This legislation enables a free movement between the different EU states but, in turn, increases competition on the tourism market as well. The common European currency might be another factor that reduces the entry barriers. Hotel companies operating in Euro zone countries do not have to pay exchange rates and transaction costs anymore what again may make them to build up or expand their business to markets within the Euro zone. This increases competition.. Bargaining Power of SuppliersThe bargaining power of suppliers is low in the field of human resources due to a relatively high rate of unemployment in made via Internet have more than doubled from about 6% to 5/8% between 998 and 002 in Europe and shows the increase of bargaining power of consumers towards suppliers.. Intensity of Rivalry in the IndustryDue to the fact of free movement and establishment of businesses within the EU the competition between hotel companies may have went up as it is easier to set up a firm abroad. Budget hotels have a share of 5/8% in the French hotel sector. Three star hotels count 0% and four star and luxury hotels % (INSEE 005/8b). These figures show that the main competitors for luxury hotels are rather in the budget sector than the luxury sector itself. Key competitors within the market sector range from organisations operating worldwide to companies working only in that positioning aims at creating 'a distinctive place in the minds of potential customers, a place where customers know who we are, how we are different from our competition, and how we can satisfy their needs and wants'. Hence, positioning is about placing the product on the market from a customers' point of view and not the management's one. It has to be developed an image, the client's advantage needs to be shown and the product must differentiate itself from competitive out that The Victorian Chateaux Hotels offer a higher rack rate than two of its competitors. Only one has topped its price. Looking at the location plotting with regard to the proximity to Paris The Victorian Chateaux Hotels ranks three out of four. So, offering a relatively high price in contrast to the other hotel companies may weaken its market position. However, its brand image is associated with very good quality standard and thus, it might boost the position on the market towards its key competitors. The Victorian Chateaux Hotels should maintain its positioning strategy and keep focusing on a high price high quality approach because that is what customers expect from it and how they perceive this brand. Hospitality Marketing Mix9. Theory of Standardisation and AdaptationOrganisations setting up new business on foreign markets are faced with the decision whether or not to adjust their marketing mix strategy to the potential host country. One option is standardisation and means that a company maintains its marketing mix when entering the market abroad. Adaptation or customisation, however, is the opposite option and refers to a marketing mix that is changed towards national or local regulations and states: '. multinational standardization would mean the offering of identical product lines at identical prices through identical distribution systems, supported by identical promotional programs, in several different countries. At the other extreme, completely 'localized' marketing strategies would contain no common elements whatsoever. Obliviously, neither of these extremes is often feasible or desirable.'However, points out that: '. in Western Europe but also some other parts of the world, social and economic trends are working in favor of more, rather than less, standardization in marketing policies. Tourism, international communication, increased numbers of multinational customers, and other forces are all tending toward greater unification of multinational markets.'This development may have even enforced during the last decades towards a globalised market. Therefore, bearing in mind that there is no absolute standardised or customised marketing strategy it is necessary to decide which elements of the marketing mix should be standardised and adapted respectively. Here, different factors play a role such as culture, legislation or economic development including market structure.. Hospitality Marketing Mix of The Victorian Chateaux Hotel9. LocationThe Victorian Chateaux Hotel should focus on countryside regions and in particular wine areas which are within an easy reach for the key target markets. Here, regions such as Burgundy, Alsace or Champagne may be selected. The first unit may be opened in the greater area of Epernay, Champagne, depending on availability of suitable facilities which can be converted into a hotel. This site should be chosen because main competitors are not situated directly in this area and it seems to be that there are no luxury hotels so far.. ProductThe Victorian Chateaux Hotels are previous castles converted into hotel premises. They are refitted in accordance with its prestigious past and many individual features. It is planned to offer 0 guestrooms and suites. All rooms have their own style and are equipped with a mini-bar, television and radio. Two individual conference rooms ranging from 5/8 to 0 seats can be used for business meetings, workshops, and other occasions. A restaurant with local specialities and a wine cellar with a wide choice of wines, especially those from the region, are included. There should be an additional panoramic dining room suitable for receptions and a bar that has a very fine collection of wines. Leisure facilities include a heated open air swimming pool, tennis courts, a sun bathing terrace and spa. Looking at the physical attributes of the product it is adapted to local/regional conditions whereas service attributes should be rather standardised as the hotel tries to target mainly international customers.. DistributionThe key target markets for The Victorian Chateaux Hotels are generally international tourists. For that reason it is assumed that the most effective distribution channel for delivering the product might be the Internet. This could include booking options via the own homepage or virtual intermediaries. However, as the product also aims at seniors the traditional distribution channels such as travel agency or tour operator may be included as well. Even though the penetration rate of Internet use is very high in the UK there is an unequal distribution in favour of younger points out that: 'it is very easy for English business-people to see English as the language of Europe. But a pack printed only in English would be understood by at most out of consumers in the EU, and in other languages by even fewer.'Another reason can be seen in the objection towards English as common language. This may apply especially for French improve service and marketing mix strategy. According to the findings it can be recommended to enter the French hospitality market but it should be also paid attention to the risks mentioned above. Only so, The Victorian Chateaux Hotels can compete and be successful in the long run.""","""Hospitality Industry in France""","2158","""France is renowned for its exquisite hospitality industry, which seamlessly blends heritage, luxury, and innovation to offer guests unforgettable experiences.

The country's capital, Paris, is a magnet for luxury travelers, boasting iconic hotels such as the Ritz Paris, Hotel Plaza Athénée, and Le Meurice. These properties not only offer luxurious amenities but also provide a glimpse into France's rich cultural heritage and art de vivre.  Beyond Paris, France's countryside is dotted with charming bed and breakfasts, known as """"chambres d'hôtes,"""" where guests can experience authentic French hospitality in a more intimate setting. These establishments are often run by locals who are passionate about sharing their culture and cuisine with visitors, offering a personalized touch that resonates with many travelers seeking an immersive experience.  In recent years, the hospitality industry in France has witnessed a surge in eco-friendly and sustainable practices. From hotels implementing energy-saving initiatives to restaurants sourcing ingredients locally, there is a growing emphasis on reducing the industry's environmental footprint. Many establishments have also embraced eco-certifications and green building standards to appeal to environmentally conscious travelers and contribute to the global sustainability movement.  Another trend shaping the hospitality landscape in France is the rise of experiential travel. Travelers are increasingly seeking authentic and hands-on experiences that allow them to immerse themselves in the local culture. From wine tasting in the vineyards of Bordeaux to cooking classes in Provence, French hospitality providers are innovating to offer unique and memorable experiences that go beyond traditional sightseeing.  The culinary scene in France is an integral part of its hospitality industry, with the country being celebrated for its gastronomic excellence. French cuisine is a cornerstone of the nation's identity, and many hotels and restaurants take pride in showcasing the best of local produce and culinary traditions. Whether indulging in a Michelin-starred meal or savoring regional specialties at a family-owned bistro, dining in France is a feast for the senses.  In the realm of luxury hospitality, France sets a high standard globally. The country's luxury hotels and resorts are renowned for their elegance, impeccable service, and attention to detail.

"6110","""Horticultural production has changed since the time that the main scope was quantity. The last decades consumers demand products of reasonable price and high quality. A great concern of consumers is impact of modern ways of cultivation to environment. The climate change and problems of pollution of water, air and soil are partly connected to agricultural activities. After the development of quality management systems and their use in agriculture, it became clear that not only high quality products are desirable, but also it is important to minimize the impact of farming to the environment. Many quality standards exist and all of them have environmental guidelines. Some environmental and quality systems are ISO series, Environmental Management and Audit of course organic standards of soil association have particular references to environmental protection. There are numerous management systems for horticulture which may vary to different countries, but if someone could summarize the most important principles of them, could come to a conclusion that reuse and recycling, energy efficiency, prevention of pollution and sustaining of fauna and flora are the main axes.(Piper L., Ryding S.V. and Henricson C. 003). The environmental management systems examine each stage of the production procedure by the environmental aspect, the environmental impact and the environmental effect. By the view of environmental aspects, activities are recorded by the possible impact that can have. Impacts record the changes that occur because of a certain activity, positive or negative, and the environmental effects record the results of the environmental impacts.(Piperal. 003) Scientists connect modern agriculture methods to global and local pollution issues. The public demand for environmental protection is a fact that could not be ignored. Governments around the world, take certain measures to assure the sustainability of agriculture. In U.K. environmental agency and Linking Environment and Farming to several environmental issues connected to agriculture. There are also many schemes like assured produce that set environmental standards. Many retailers like TESCO, create logos as the 'nature's choice' for products under environmental standards in order to meet consumers demands and add value to their products. Pepper is a very popular horticultural product, it is consumed almost all over the world. Because of its popularity it is cultivated in many places under protection. In order to have great production and higher quality products a lot of inputs are required. Fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, herbicides and other chemical compounds could be possible pollutants. In order to prevent pollution special treatment is necessary. Pollution may come from emission of gasses or use of material that can not be recycled. Also the excess of waste may be a problem for a horticultural enterprise. In order to provide a certification to a farmer who is cultivating peppers under protection certain criteria should be accomplished. First of all, auditing schemes will record the energy efficiency of the pepper greenhouse. The consumption of fuels for heating the greenhouse, use of the machinery, vehicles and other equipment is a crucial factor. The quality and the quantity of fuels used per kilogram of product is a very useful factor for testing the environmental performance of the horticultural enterprise. All fuels release carbon dioxide which is the main gas that affects the global climatic change due to the glasshouse effect. So, the choice of an environmental way of heating, like LPG, natural gas or even green waste, can have significant affect to the reduction of global pollution gasses. Also, the reduction of vehicle movement could be beneficial in terms of pollution prevention and could save money for the owner. Energy also could be consumed for artificial lighting. Consumption of electricity is also a very significant factor, because emission of carbon dioxide per KWh is quite high. A useful indicator for testing the environmental efficiency of the greenhouse could be the measurement of energy consumed per kilogram of product. A grower could improve the energy consumption indicator not only by minimizing the energy needs of the greenhouse, but also by increasing its productivity. In order to have better quality and higher production of peppers amounts of fertilizers will be used. All environmental and quality schemes require that the use of fertilizers will not be in excess amounts. Phosphoric and nitrogen fertilizers can contaminate the surface and ground water of an area. In places that many agricultural enterprises exist water pollution by fertilizers may be a major local issue. People can not drink water because of the high amount of nitrates and fauna of lakes can be affected due to water eutrophy. The environmental management systems could use several indicators in order to evaluate the affect of fertilizers, as the concentration of water pollutants in the ground water or in the soil.(Piper at al. 003). Soil analyses in order to identify the true demands of the plants are required. A qualified agronomist could give useful advises about the application of fertilizers. The knowledge of the area is also very important. if there are Nitrate Vulnerable the grower should be aware of it and be more careful. (The environment agency 006). If the pepper production is soiless then it would be extremely beneficial for the environment, if recirculation of elements and water took place. The peppers protection of pests and diseases is very important. Below there are some main pests and diseases and some of the biocides that are commonly used and have the approval of the British Crop Protection Council in 998. The table can give a general idea of the many different substances that can be used for crop protection. Some quality standards permit the use of only a number of substances. For example organic standards permit only the use of inorganic a Waste Management take the waste to a recovery or disposal site. (Environmental agency 006). The way of managing wastes is mainly a local issue, but it is very important in terms of environmental protection. Waste management can be beneficial both for environment and growers, because they could save a lot of money and be more competitive. An indicator that many environmental standards use is the reuse of material. The reuse of material is a very affective way to reduce waste quantities and cost of the pepper greenhouse. If the peppers are cultivated with hydroponic way it is very affective to use a recirculation system in order to reuse minerals and water. It is also very important that many materials that will be used, to be provided by suppliers that have similar environmental standards. A pepper greenhouse uses a lot of plastic, mainly for packaging purposes. Plastic may also be needed for the roof and the walls of the green house since modern horticultural plastics have better characteristics for plant growth than glass. It is very possible that the peppers will need a special substrate for their development. The main material that substrates consist of, is peat, but, peat extraction is harmful for the environment. Most of the places that peat is extracted are natural habitats for many species. The government is planning a gradually reduction of pat use. Many studies take place around the world in order to find peat alternative substrates. Materials as green wastes, furniture and wood residues can be used. Horticultural industry could absorb many wastes of other sources, so the environmental performance of the pepper greenhouse could be improved if recycled materials were used. There are several issues that affect the local environment, the wild fauna and flora and the local population that environmental management standards address. Apart from the application of fertilizers, biocides and waste production, the noise and light levels could affect wild life and the people that may live near the green house. Machinery of the enterprise could be a great nuisance both for human and animals. Artificial light also may be a problem. All these factors should be under serious consideration in order to minimize the impact of agricultural enterprise to the local environmental. The measures that are taken in order to increase the environmental efficiency of the green house should be documented. Documentation is very important because, it has to summarize all the actions taken by sector and date. The audits should be able to examine by documents if the goals that were set, have been accomplished. Training of the personnel, establishing of routines and emergency procedures also have to be described by documents. All the actions should be harmonious to the legal requirements. Documentation should be recorded and include the results of audits, checking and correction actions. (Piperal. 003). Due to increased concern about the global and local pollution issues and the climatic change environmental management will more and more important. Environmental management standards meet consumers expectations. Protect public health and prevent potential environmental negative impact from human activities, by assisting the improving and maintenance of the environment. Producers are able to enter new more demanding markets and increase their profit by adding value to their product. Consumers feel safer about the quality of products and producers can decrease the functional cost of their enterprise in long term. In the past producers and consumers had the 'us and them' culture and unnecessary antagonism was developed. Environmental and quality standards tend to minimize this kind of antagonism by providing insurance at a reasonable cost, so they help to maintain good public and community relations.( Sayre D. 996).""","""Environmental impact of horticulture practices""","1797","""Horticulture, the art and science of cultivating plants for food, medicinal purposes, and ornamental use, plays a crucial role in providing us with fresh produce and beautiful green spaces. However, like any agricultural practice, horticulture can have significant environmental impacts. Understanding and addressing these impacts is essential for creating sustainable and eco-friendly horticultural practices that can support both human needs and the health of our planet.  One of the primary environmental impacts of horticulture is the use of chemical inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. While these substances can boost plant growth and protect crops from pests and diseases, they can also have negative consequences for the environment. Excessive use of fertilizers can lead to nutrient runoff into water bodies, causing eutrophication and harming aquatic ecosystems. Pesticides can harm non-target species, including beneficial insects, birds, and mammals. They can also contribute to the development of pesticide-resistant pests, leading to a vicious cycle of increased chemical use.  To mitigate these impacts, horticulturists are increasingly adopting integrated pest management (IPM) approaches that emphasize the use of biological controls, cultural practices, and monitoring to minimize the need for chemical pesticides. Additionally, organic horticulture practices, which eschew synthetic chemicals in favor of natural inputs like compost and beneficial insects, are gaining popularity for their lower environmental impact.  Another significant environmental impact of horticulture is water usage. Irrigation practices in horticulture can place a heavy burden on water resources, especially in regions already facing water scarcity. Inefficient irrigation methods, such as overhead sprinklers that lead to water loss through evaporation, can exacerbate this issue. Water-intensive crops like ornamental plants and certain fruits and vegetables can further strain water supplies.  To address water-related environmental impacts, horticulturists are exploring water-saving irrigation techniques such as drip irrigation and mulching. These methods deliver water directly to plant roots, reducing waste and improving efficiency. Choosing drought-tolerant plant species and implementing rainwater harvesting systems are other strategies to reduce water consumption in horticulture.  The choice of plant species in horticulture can also have environmental consequences. The introduction of non-native plant species can lead to ecological disruption by outcompeting native flora, altering habitats, and affecting wildlife populations. Invasive plants can spread rapidly, crowding out native species and reducing biodiversity. Furthermore, the cultivation of monocultures in horticultural practices can increase the risk of pest outbreaks and diseases, necessitating greater pesticide use.  To minimize these impacts, horticulturists are encouraged to prioritize native plant species in their designs and plant selections. Native plants are adapted to local conditions, require less maintenance, and provide important habitat and food sources for local wildlife. Diversifying plantings with a mix of species can also improve resilience against pests and diseases, reducing the need for chemical interventions.  Soil health is another critical aspect of horticulture that can impact the environment. Intensive cultivation practices, such as excessive tillage and the heavy use of chemical fertilizers, can degrade soil quality, leading to erosion, compaction, nutrient depletion, and loss of biodiversity. Degraded soils are less able to support healthy plant growth and are more prone to runoff and erosion, which can pollute waterways.  To promote soil health and reduce environmental harm, horticulturists are adopting practices like minimal tillage, cover cropping, and composting to improve soil structure, fertility, and biological activity. Building healthy soils not only benefits plant growth but also helps sequester carbon from the atmosphere, contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.  In addition to these direct environmental impacts, horticulture also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions through energy use, transportation, and the decomposition of organic materials. The production and transportation of inputs like fertilizers, pesticides, and plant materials require energy, much of which comes from fossil fuels. Decomposing organic matter in landfills or anaerobic conditions produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas.  To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, horticulturists are exploring sustainable practices such as using renewable energy sources, promoting local sourcing to reduce transportation emissions, and implementing composting systems to recycle organic waste. Increasing the use of perennial plants, which require less soil disturbance and replanting, can also help reduce carbon emissions associated with horticultural activities.  Ultimately, addressing the environmental impact of horticulture requires a holistic approach that considers the full lifecycle of plant production, from seed to harvest to waste disposal. By adopting sustainable practices that protect soil, water, biodiversity, and air quality, horticulturists can contribute to a healthier environment for current and future generations. Through thoughtful planning, responsible management, and ongoing innovation, horticulture can be a force for positive change in the world, supporting both human well-being and planetary health.""","970"
"6061","""A corpus-based description of English enables further insight into language beyond that which we gain from reference books and introspection of our own native language. The arrival and development of this approach in recent decades has led to much research into the behaviours of individual lexical items and phrases. Corpus analysis is concerned with patterns and frequencies and allows us to discover what is probable in language, by looking at statistical tendencies. Hunston and Francis have extended the application of the corpus based computer program to enable the studying of specific grammatical patterns. They played an important role in the creation of the Collins COBUILD Grammar Patterns was the first time that the comprehensive range of verb patterns were methodically organised. They investigate the following hypothesis: 'that particular patterns will tend to be associated with lexical items that have particular meanings'. Halliday seems to follow this ideology, arguing that 'grammar and vocabulary are not two different things' but instead refers to them as 'the same thing seen by different observers'. This essay looks to explore and evaluate some of the possible relationships between patterns and meanings, specifically of verbs, using examples set out by Hunston and Francis, which have additionally been tested in The Bank of English. Having searched for numerous grammatical patterns in the Bank of English Corpus, Hunston and Francis were faced with concordance lines which feature a search term in the middle and a certain number of words on either side, thus exemplifying the words which were found to follow such patterns. They then divided the words, where possible, into various semantic groups, providing a basis for a study into the relationship between pattern and meaning. Whilst one of the most important observations is that this relationship exists, it is also important to realise that this is a complex relationship which very much varies depending on which pattern is in question. This is similar to the way that the verb has grammatical control over the other participants of a clause. Berk states that it is the verb phrase that is at the heart of the sentence. Furthermore in Transformational Grammar, it is the verb that dominates the tree diagram structure and thus commands the rest of the constituents in the comes of a family of painters good will come of all. Determiners, such as all, do not stand on their own but rather are included in the noun phrase, so this method of searching for a pattern is very effective. Continuing with V of n, there are numerous types of verbs which are found to follow this pattern. When Hunston and Francis look into this pattern and generate the list of adherent words, they acknowledge that at a glance the verbs lack any obvious connection. They then look more closely, however, and are able to categorize the verbs into groups which are somehow thought to be semantically linked. They identify the following five semantic groups: verbs meaning 'to talk'; verbs associated with mental processes; verbs connected to the physical senses of the body; verbs to do with 'knowing' or acquiring knowledge and the last group consists of only two words with a notion of 'losing', namely dispose and drain. Where there are five additional verbs which cannot be characterised in any of these ways, this does not deny the compelling evidence that a connection between patterns and meaning exists. Of course just as in many aspects of Corpus Linguistics, the decisions involved in this grouping were made by no less than native speaker intuition. This gives rise to some questions of accuracy as these decisions could easily vary across individuals. Hunston and Francis address this issue, however, and believe that 'most observers would arrive at meaning groups that were very similar to each other'. Decisions of acceptability can also be made by native speakers as intuition often senses the probability that a particular word will occur within any given pattern. It is stressed that purely because a verb appears in a list, does not mean that it does so in all of its senses. Similarly, any items in a list cannot be assumed to have any shared qualities with each other, apart from the fact that they both occur in that pattern with reasonable frequency. In fact the only information we are able to gain about the words themselves, is the fact that they all appear in this list. Some pairs or groups of words are partly synonymous, for example in certain syntactic environments. Not all part-synonyms will necessarily share a pattern though. In the case of V of n in fact it is more likely that they will not. It therefore proves impossible to foretell which words are likely to follow any given pattern. The verb think for example exhibits the pattern V of n in such phrases as think of England. The verb consider on the other hand, although partly synonymous with think, is not a potential candidate for following the pattern. In this case this is due to the transitivity structure of the two verbs. Think is intransitive whereas consider is transitive and thus requires an immediate direct object; something which must 'be considered'. Searching a Corpus for any item or query is extremely useful for both learners and researchers of language, not only because it provides them with evidence of actual usage, but also because patterns can give clues towards the inherent meaning and structure of verbs. There are many types of relationships between patterns and meaning. Some patterns occur with an abundant entourage of verbs found to share it. Sometimes, however, a pattern is found to be attributed to only a very small selection of verbs. First of all it is important to consider that there is no direct correlation between individual patterns and the meanings of the words which follow them. Often the words which follow the pattern are placed in numerous semantic groups with several different meanings, but even then it is verging on the impossible to find a semantic category for each item. Where there are many types of verbs which are able to exhibit the pattern V of n, and it is largely the individual lexical items that carry the meaning, there are some patterns on the other hand, which themselves carry a certain degree of meaning. Such a pattern is V n into - ing. Here, there are more restrictions on the types of words which can be said to follow the pattern. This pattern has a statistical tendency to mean somehow making someone do something that they have little desire to do. Verbs that frequently follow this pattern are often associated with persuasive conversation and include pressure, charm and blackmail. Again Francis et to further divide the verbs into semantic groups of ways of making someone do something. These are the following: 'force', 'trick', 'charm', 'spur' and a leftover group of exceptional items. Although these subgroups exist, unlike the groups of verbs of V of n, these all have a shared meaning in the context of the pattern. When this pattern is passivised and converted to be V-ed into -ing, the meaning remains the same. Such an observation is evidence to suggest that some patterns on their own carry a meaning, and sometimes any one of a vast number of partial synonyms can be used to create the same semantic effect. An overwhelming majority of verbs following the pattern V n into - ing have clear negative connotations, giving a sense of craftiness on behalf of the 'persuader'. It must be mentioned, however, that there is a small minority of verbs following V n into -ing, which give a more positive feel and the 'persuader' seems less devious. These are cited with extreme rarity in the Bank of English but nonetheless are there. Examples of such verbs are excite and relax. These are contrary to the negative semantic prosody inherent in the mass of verbs. For this reason it is impossible to observe a direct correlation between pattern and meaning; no assumptions can be made. The reason that a compact number of items may rarely occur in a pattern, could be due to an intentional or unintentional analogy. As soon as a connection between pattern and meaning is established, speakers, often subconsciously, use a certain amount of creativity. Through either failure to come up with the desired word, or volitional creative flair, a new word arrives in the list of possible instantiations of a pattern. The verb expire for example, partly synonymous with the verb die, is cited in the Bank of English a total of 5/819 times, only citations, however, appear in the pattern V of n. It would be inappropriate either way, to make a judgement on whether or not a verb could be said to follow a pattern. Such a judgement would be unsubstantiated. Sentences are not simply linear strings of words, nor is a grammatical pattern a ready-made structure that words can be slotted into and exchanged in a random order. The connection is a great deal closer than that. The work of Sinclair somewhat opposes that of Hunston and Francis, as he investigates only lexical items and their behaviour. Nevertheless after researching the exclusive patterning of the verb yield, he reaches the following conclusion: 'It seems there is a strong tendency for sense and syntax to be associated'. Hunston summarises the relationship between pattern and meaning: 'for the most part the meanings of words are distinguished by the patterns or phraseologies in which they typically occur'. The investigating of patterns and their connection with meaning does not show which verbs can or cannot be used in a certain way. As Hunston and Francis admit themselves, 'if one subscribes to the view that to know a language means to be able, potentially, to generate all and only the sentences in that language, then such an omission is serious indeed'. This reflects the wider context of Corpus Linguistics in general, as it is not meant to be a prescriptive way of telling us what we can and cannot say. Rather it is more of a descriptive way of analysing language performance, demonstrating the strong tendencies of a language or a feature of language. Corpora contain only linguistic material and no paralinguistic features are included which is sometimes where much of the meaning lies. No distinction is made between what is correct or incorrect, and the corpus may well contain some items which some speakers would find difficult to accept. Partington acknowledges a criticism of the Corpus based approach to language research: 'language is studied divorced from its context of communication. Any information derived from the type of corpus which contains texts from a variety of sources and authors, and the concordances arising from such a corpus, can have little validity since we tend to know nothing about the author of the message of a concordance line and their illocutionary intentions. (.) Concordance data are as decontextualised as any linguistic information could possible and therefore cannot count as communication'. It is precisely because there are no guidelines of correctness that analogy occurs. Both patterns and meanings are subject to change over time. Hunston and Francis attribute the following change to British speakers assimilating American characteristics of language. The verb impact is cited in The Bank of English highly frequently when occurring in the pattern V on n, as in impact on the education system. It is cited far fewer times under the pattern V n, as in impacted on the economy. This signifies a change of patterning due to a possible analogy with another verb, for example affect. Consequently, analogy is a feasible explanation for language change.""","""Corpus Linguistics and Language Patterns""","2240","""Corpus linguistics is a powerful tool in the study of language patterns, offering researchers a systematic approach to analyze large bodies of text. By compiling and analyzing extensive collections of spoken and written language samples, linguists can uncover underlying structures, trends, and patterns that shape human communication. This field has seen a surge in popularity in recent years due to the availability of digital corpora and advances in technology, making it a valuable resource for understanding language use in various contexts.  One of the key contributions of corpus linguistics is its ability to reveal patterns in language that might otherwise go unnoticed. Through the systematic analysis of linguistic data, researchers can identify recurring words, phrases, and grammatical structures that shed light on the underlying rules and conventions of a language. This allows linguists to move beyond intuition and anecdotal evidence, providing empirical support for theories about language structure and use.  Corpora, or collections of texts in electronic form, serve as the foundation for corpus linguistics research. These corpora can range from small specialized collections to vast repositories of texts spanning different genres, registers, and time periods. By using specialized software, researchers can search, retrieve, and analyze data from these corpora, enabling them to explore linguistic phenomena in a systematic and replicable manner.  One of the main benefits of corpus linguistics is its ability to provide insights into language variation and change. By comparing different corpora or analyzing texts from different periods, researchers can track how language use evolves over time. This longitudinal perspective allows linguists to study the impact of historical, social, and cultural factors on language structure and usage, offering valuable insights into the dynamic nature of human communication.  Moreover, corpus linguistics has practical applications in fields such as language teaching, translation, and natural language processing. Language teachers can use corpora to design materials that reflect authentic language use, helping learners develop proficiency in real-world communication. Translators can also benefit from corpus tools to identify patterns in source and target languages, improving the quality and accuracy of their translations. In the field of natural language processing, corpora serve as training data for machine learning algorithms that power applications such as speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.  In addition to its applications in research and technology, corpus linguistics has also made significant contributions to our understanding of language usage in different contexts. By analyzing corpora of spoken and written texts, researchers can investigate how language varies across genres, registers, and social groups. This sociolinguistic perspective allows linguists to explore questions of identity, power, and ideology as they manifest in language use, providing valuable insights into the complex interplay between language and society.  Furthermore, corpus linguistics plays a crucial role in the study of second language acquisition and bilingualism. By analyzing learner corpora, researchers can identify common errors, transfer patterns from the learners' first language, and track the development of proficiency in the target language. This empirical approach provides valuable data for designing effective language teaching materials and strategies that address learners' specific needs and challenges.  Overall, corpus linguistics offers a systematic and empirical approach to studying language patterns, enabling researchers to uncover hidden structures and trends in linguistic data. By using corpora as their primary source of evidence, linguists can gain valuable insights into language variation, change, and usage, while also making practical contributions to fields such as language teaching, translation, and natural language processing. As technology continues to advance and more linguistic data becomes available, corpus linguistics is poised to play an increasingly important role in shaping our understanding of how language works and evolves in diverse contexts.""","712"
"5","""The intention of this paper is move outward from new and old statistical empirical evidence, found on the one hand in the National the RAF Museum Archive, and on the other, in existing secondary literature, and ask what this reveals about British air strategy in the 920s and 930s. The methodology used is to take researched evidence, portray it in the form of charts, data bases or spreadsheets, and then use this IT generated information as the foundation for discussion. The archive material was not examined with any pre-conceived conclusions in mind. It will be our job to use all the empirical meat to create an interpretable abstract of air strategy. We will question whether these sources either perpetuate or shed new light on existing discourse. Along the road the sources will be challenged for their usefulness as historical pieces of evidence. As a point of entry into the mise-en-scene of air strategy in the 920s, let us analyse a RAF proposed peace strength and amended from 933 onwards, outlining the types and numbers of planes required for the front line by a certain date, provide the key to unlocking the deeper roots associated with air policy in this period. Figure below, produced from this Appendix, shows that the Britain was increasingly dedicating her resources to bombers. With the collapse of air disarmament talks, following the ignominious end to the Geneva Conference, policymakers sought a new means to prevent the knock out blow. It was axiomatic to air strategy that a commitment to building a bomber force would act as a deterrent against German air attack, presaging the Cold War concept of Mutually Assured Destruction. Increasing the number of bombers from 76 in 934 to 5/889 by 937, as shown in the Appendix, worked under the belief that 'qui desiderat pacem, praeparet bellum'. On a diplomatic level, it was felt that a bomber force might bring Germany back to the Conference table. On a political level, it allayed public fears about a lack of preparation for air attack. The data also reveal a proportionally sharp increase of bomber requirements from February. This can be seen as an equalising knee-jerk response to Hitler's alarming 935/8 parity-achievement claim, which 'set the Nazi cat squarely among the democratic pigeons'. One limitation to our source, however, is that it does not show the number of bombers required in a reserve capacity to sustain operations. This would distinguish absolutely how far Britain worked under the strategy of shop window deterrence. Nevertheless, this source illustrates that air strategy was doing far more than aimlessly stirring Britain from her slumbers as Figure suggests, and was in fact, in its dedication to bombers, a piece of political conjuring to hypnotise its audience. Cited in John Terraine, A Time for Courage: The RAF in the European War 939-945/8 (New York, 985/8), p. Denis Richards, The Royal Air Force Volume: The Fight at Odds (London, 974), p. 2. The next area of our paper will examine the immediate pre-war years. Firstly, let us look at the data given in an Air Ministry report, as indicated in Figure below, on the production of airframes between August 938 and November 939. It is clear that, from January 939, airframe manufacturers started to exceed their production promises. These promises would have been established with policymakers in the deterrence by parity years. Although not explicit in the chart, we can draw three possible conclusions from this. The surpassing of airframe guarantees can almost incontestably be seen as the final nail in the coffin for the parity strategy, as the government encouraged air manufacturers to move towards a war footing. Not only had hopes of an air convention been lost but also the promises of Munich seemed long forgotten. Britannia's trident was now a bayonet and her shield a gas mask. Less probably, it could reflect that manufacturers had simply become more efficient in their production, no longer cruising at barely economical speed. More sinisterly, the data could suggest production profiteering, as captured in the illustration below (albeit in 935/8). Ultimately, however, the source is best at confirming the end of air parity, than it is at hinting at more polemical speculations. However, these delivery numbers fail to paint the whole picture. We need to examine the types of planes produced. Figure, working on a microcosmic level of production, shows the number of Spitfires delivered from the Eastleigh Production Facility. It is quite apparent that a significant rise in production occurred from October 938 onwards. However, this source is fundamentally limited in understanding air strategy, as Spitfires were neither the archetypal fighter in 938- nor accounted for the bulk of the fighter force. Hurricane production is also required, in order to obtain a true picture of any significant change in production, and ergo air strategy. The difference in orders was 647 more Hurricanes (Appendix ). Importantly, Figure 0 below shows that from June 938 the number of all fighters being delivered rose feverishly. This supports existing discourse, which argues that policymakers from early 938 onwards increased fighter production for air defence purposes. A 938 Command Paper reflects this, lamenting the failure of the bomber deterrence strategy, and stating 'taking risks for peace has not removed the dangers of war'. Major technological improvements with fighter capability, coupled with the coming of radar, presented the Command Paper, Statement Relating to Defence: Presented by the Primeminister to Parliament March 938 (London, 938), p.. possibility of withstanding the knock out blow. This in turn threatened Germany with the prospect of a long war, which was arguably a more credible deterrent than simply a bomber build up, given the greater long term resources of the Empire. However, this Figure has a limitation of its own, because it does not tell us the relative fighter position vis-a-vis the wider picture of total aircraft production and in particular that of bombers. To combat these problems, we can refer to the data provided in the Cabinet approved air schemes L and M (Appendix ). The two pie charts below comprising Figure 1 compare the required aircraft by proportion of all total planes in April 938 and November 938. It is immediately apparent that only a small shift away from bombers towards fighters occurred. This is by no means supportive of existing discourse. Literature on 930's air power recognises the shift but argues that it was much more pronounced, with production geared three to one in favour of fighters. However, Figure 1 indicates that, in receiving well over 0 per cent of total aircraft production, the bomber remained the main player in air strategy, notwithstanding a greater emphasis to fighters. Thus, the pie charts provide an empirically tested challenge to the current epistemological understanding of the period. The final part of this paper will question the common usage by contemporary historians of simple comparative air power strength charts, as exemplified by Figure 2 below. Use of such charts to critique Britain's air strategy vis-a-vis other nations to illustrate Britain's 'dreadful note of preparation' is potentially too shallow. Although not wishing to be overly judgmental - this would require an exhaustive analysis far beyond the scope of this paper - it is essential that we lay bare certain qualifications the air historian needs to comprehend if he or she wishes to use such charts as an empirical authority. It is difficult to compare aircraft production in basic numerical terms, as the quality of aircraft varied greatly from country to country and year to year and was driven by different operational demands. Furthermore the numbers include Denis Richards, The Royal Air Force Volume: The Fight at Odds (London, 974), p. 2. more than front line types (for example, Germany devoted far larger amounts of production than Britain to trainers), and they give us no insight into how many of the aircraft delivered were immediately deployable, through pilot availability and other factors. Also ignored in assessing proportional difference in air strength is the contribution of anti-aircraft defences. The contemporary historian, therefore, needs to take these sensitivities in his metaphorical knapsack when he enters the archives. To conclude, it has been the intention of this paper to work with primary and secondary statistical source material obtained from the National Archives, the RAF Museum and existing literature, in an effort to see what estimate and production data reveal about air strategy in the 920s and 930s. Much of the evidence has converged with existing historiographical discourse, outlining a gradual maturity of air strategy, extending from labouring within the parameters of a restricted budget through to the mantra of home defence. But some of the recently researched material sheds new light on the subject. For example, our data on fighter requirements refutes existing understanding that air strategy moved absolutely from bombers to fighters in the years 938 to 939. We have also suggested that certain sources, particularly comparative charts, remain too simplistic in composition to hold any more than mere subjective value. Furthermore, the usefulness of solely Air Ministry derived sources, such as the proposed peace strength chart, are somewhat sullied because their technical estimates were shaped by non-financial predilections and bias. Although ultimately recognising, as Clifford Geertz laments 'what we call our data are really our own constructions of other people's constructions', the charts here, despite certain limitations, not only move our understanding of air strategy slowly towards a more definitive picture but also hint at possible areas for further in-depth study. Indeed, there remains a vast sum of non-researched information relating to air strategy in the 920s and 930s waiting for the historian in the archives. Arguably, what our fighter discovery shows above all is that literature on air strategy in the 920s and 930s has itself become a too entrenched 'matter of faith'. It is thus the job of the air historian to revise further the subject, particularly the years 938 to 939, in greater detail. 1 Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures (New York, 973), p..""","""British air strategy in 1920s-1930s""","2051","""In the turbulent period between the two World Wars, the British Empire found itself grappling with the evolving nature of warfare and the looming specter of another global conflict. With the rapid advancements in aviation technology, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) faced the daunting task of formulating an air strategy to defend its interests, deter potential adversaries, and maintain air superiority. The 1920s and 1930s witnessed significant developments in British air strategy, shaped by political, technological, and strategic considerations.  At the outset of this era, the aftermath of World War I loomed large over military planning. The concept of strategic bombing had emerged as a powerful tool during the conflict, leading British military thinkers to recognize the importance of air power in future conflicts. The 1923 Imperial Conference marked a pivotal moment with the endorsement of the """"Ten Year Rule,"""" which assumed that Britain would enjoy a decade of peace and therefore could limit defense spending. However, this period of relative peace was short-lived as geopolitical tensions rose in Europe and the Far East, prompting a reassessment of British air strategy.  One of the key developments during this period was the growing emphasis on the strategic use of air power. The idea of strategic bombing, targeting an enemy's industrial and civilian infrastructure to undermine their war effort, gained traction within the RAF. Air Marshal Hugh Trenchard, a staunch advocate for strategic bombing, argued for the creation of an independent air force capable of conducting sustained aerial offensives. This vision culminated in the establishment of the RAF as an independent service in 1918, signaling the growing importance of air power.  The doctrine of strategic bombing was codified in the landmark RAF Manual 0.100/1, also known as the """"Trenchard Doctrine,"""" which emphasized the primacy of offensive operations aimed at striking deep into enemy territory. This shift towards strategic bombing reflected a broader strategic focus on achieving victory through air superiority and the disruption of enemy capabilities. The doctrine laid the groundwork for the RAF's organizational structure, training programs, and aircraft development in the interwar years.  Technological advancements played a crucial role in shaping British air strategy during this period. The rapid pace of innovation in aircraft design, engines, and weapons systems necessitated continuous adaptation and modernization. The introduction of monoplanes, metal airframes, and more powerful engines transformed the capabilities of military aircraft, enabling greater speed, range, and payload capacity. Aircraft such as the Hawker Hart, Supermarine Spitfire, and Bristol Blenheim became iconic symbols of British aviation prowess during the 1930s.  The development of radar technology was another significant breakthrough that revolutionized air defense capabilities. The Chain Home radar system, deployed along the British coast, provided early warning of incoming enemy aircraft, giving the RAF a crucial advantage in detecting and intercepting enemy raids. Radar played a pivotal role in the defense of Britain during the Battle of Britain in 1940, underscoring the importance of technological innovation in shaping air strategy.  Strategic considerations also influenced British air strategy in the interwar period, as the Empire navigated a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and geopolitical challenges. The rise of militaristic regimes in Germany, Italy, and Japan posed a direct threat to British interests and security, prompting a reassessment of defense priorities. The Air Staff focused on developing contingency plans for potential conflicts in Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East, anticipating the need for a flexible and responsive air force.  The 1930s saw the emergence of the """"Bomber Barons,"""" a group of influential RAF officers who championed the strategic bombing campaign as a decisive means of waging war. Air Chief Marshal Cyril Newall and Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Harris were among the proponents of this approach, advocating for the expansion of the RAF's bomber force and the development of long-range bombers capable of striking deep into enemy territory. The construction of strategic bombing bases, such as RAF Waddington and RAF Mildenhall, reflected the growing importance of aerial bombardment in British military planning.  The British air strategy of the 1920s and 1930s was not without its controversies and challenges. The debate between proponents of strategic bombing and proponents of air defense, who advocated for the protection of British airspace from enemy incursions, highlighted the diverging views within the RAF leadership. The lack of resources, budget constraints, and competing priorities also strained efforts to modernize the air force and maintain readiness for potential conflicts.  Despite these challenges, the British air strategy of the interwar period laid the foundation for the RAF's successful defense of the United Kingdom during World War II. The lessons learned from the development of strategic bombing doctrine, the integration of radar technology, and the emphasis on training and professionalism positioned the RAF as a formidable force in the skies. The Battle of Britain, fought in the summer of 1940, showcased the resilience and determination of the RAF against overwhelming odds, cementing its place in history as a symbol of British resolve and ingenuity.  In conclusion, the British air strategy of the 1920s and 1930s was a period of transformation and innovation, marked by the evolution of strategic thinking, technological advancements, and strategic considerations. The emphasis on strategic bombing, technological innovation, and strategic foresight shaped the RAF into a modern and capable air force capable of defending British interests and safeguarding the Empire. The legacy of British air strategy in the interwar period endures as a testament to the enduring importance of air power in modern warfare and the strategic thinking required to confront the challenges of an uncertain world.""","1123"

This has led to a reduction in services and increased prices for public transport. 'As a consequence (of the trend), overhead costs have had to be shared among a diminishing number of customers, leaving the operators with the choice of increasing fares, or reducing services, or, most commonly, both.' Adams p 6Today - system is strained - but in future it would get worse if current trends continue 'If current trends continued, total urban traffic could increase by 0% over the next 5/8 years.' Ravetz p88The trend must therefore be reversed; otherwise it would grind to a halt.

Political boldness should be applied; politicians need to be less concerned about their political futures and more about the future of the country. 'Economic signals such as licence fees, fuel tax, tax allowances and infrastructure charges such be extended and made to 'bite' on a gradual and incremental basis.' Ravetz pp 04-05/8By increasing costs to use the private car people would eventually feel inclined to use public transport. ProblemsCurrently public transport provision is not good enough: Trains are unreliable and expensive Buses are stuck in congestion, obviously this issue relates to car use People feel less comfortable using pulic transport - elements of personal safety Public transport cannot take you 'to your door.' But the main hurdle is attitudeOver the past 0 years - the private car has transformed the way we live. People are used to this. People can use their cars - so will. It is easier than public transport Education - people need to be educated about why they need to use public transport more Other than increasing public transport use, there are other ways of cutting pollution green fuels new technology but this does not deal with congestion - which is another major problem If the trend didn't reverse, congestion would get worse if predictions are correct. How else would this be combated - through an extensive road building programme? Previous road building - such as widening the M25/8, has proven that road building does not cut congestion; it encourages people to use the roads more, therefore increasing congestion. ConclusionA reversal of this trend would be very desirable. Whilst impossible to totally illiminate car use - a reversal in this trend would significantly cut congestion due to fewer cars on the road. It would also cut pollution, and could be actioned along with an increased use of new technology and greener fuels. Is a reversal of the trend possible? Yes, if the following is applied; we need to provide better public transport services we also need to better educate people we need to discourage people from using their cars - increase the costs such as congestion charging""","""Public transport vs. private car use""","893","""Public transport and private car use are two popular modes of transportation that individuals consider when moving from one place to another. Each option has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, making it crucial for people to weigh their choices based on their needs, preferences, and circumstances.  Public transport, including buses, trains, trams, and subways, is a convenient and cost-effective way to travel. One of the primary benefits of public transport is its environmental friendliness. By using public transportation, individuals contribute to reducing air pollution and congestion on roads, thereby promoting a cleaner and healthier environment. Additionally, public transport allows for more efficient use of resources by carrying multiple passengers simultaneously, reducing the overall carbon footprint per person.  Another advantage of public transport is the potential cost savings compared to owning and operating a private car. The expenses associated with purchasing a vehicle, paying for insurance, maintenance, fuel, and parking can add up significantly over time. In contrast, public transport often offers affordable ticket prices or monthly passes, making it a financially attractive option for individuals looking to save money on transportation expenses.  Moreover, public transport provides a stress-free alternative to driving in traffic-congested areas. By utilizing public transportation, commuters can relax, read, or catch up on work during their journey instead of dealing with the hassle of navigating through traffic and finding parking spaces. This can lead to reduced stress levels and improved overall well-being for passengers.  On the other hand, private car use offers a level of convenience and flexibility that public transport may not always provide. Owning a car allows individuals to travel according to their own schedules, making unscheduled stops, and reaching destinations that may not be easily accessible by public transport. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for individuals with specific mobility needs or those living in areas with limited public transport options.  Private cars also offer increased comfort and privacy compared to public transportation. Commuters have control over the temperature, music, and overall environment of their vehicle, providing a personalized travel experience. Additionally, private cars allow for door-to-door transportation, eliminating the need to walk to and from public transport stops, especially beneficial in inclement weather or for individuals with mobility challenges.  However, the convenience of private car use comes with its own set of drawbacks. One significant disadvantage is the high environmental impact associated with individual car ownership, including greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion. The reliance on private vehicles contributes to the deterioration of air quality and exacerbates issues related to climate change.  Furthermore, the cost of owning and operating a private car can be substantial, especially when factoring in expenses such as insurance, fuel, maintenance, and parking fees. For individuals on tight budgets or those living in urban areas with limited parking options, the financial burden of owning a car can be a significant consideration when choosing between public transport and private car use.  In conclusion, the decision between public transport and private car use ultimately depends on individual preferences, priorities, and circumstances. Public transport offers affordability, environmental benefits, and stress-free commutes, while private car use provides convenience, flexibility, and personalized travel experiences. By carefully evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each mode of transportation, individuals can make informed choices that align with their needs and values, balancing considerations such as cost, convenience, environmental impact, and overall well-being.""","658"
"300","""Question Ikea's philosophy is to provide 'low price, value for money furnishings with a wide range of choice'. This philosophy, along with Ikea's associated competitive strategy, influences the operations performance objectives of the company. The company's overall competitive strategy influences the operation's competitive role within the company which in turn influences the performance objectives. It will be shown that the resulting main performance objectives of Ikea's operations are Ikea and traditional competitors will be compared and contrasted. QualityWhilst the quality performance objective is important to product/service flexibility objective to introduce new of modified products, resulting in the 'creative sourcing' from approximately 100 suppliers in 3 countries. In contrast, competitors generally have far less product flexibility due to in part to having far less flexibility in sourcing. CostCost is the other of the two most important objectives for Ikea. Ikea's philosophy is once again to provide 'low price, value for money furnishings with a wide range of choice'. Cost is one of its major competitive factors. Whilst its competitors will see cost as a major factor, it is relatively less of a competitive factor than it is for Ikea. Ikea achieves low cost by: Reducing staff numbers and therefore the associated cost of hiring and paying them. It does this by using automated machines in the a framework, the following are the key structural and infrastructural operations decisions that Ikea has made in order to achieve the appropriate levels of performance: Structural Operations DecisionsNew product/service developmentIkea continuously looks for new products. It's philosophy includes the phrase 'Most things still remain to be done'. This philosophy results in the operations decision of 'creative sourcing' whereby products are sourced from 100 suppliers in 3 countries resulting in economies of scale. Some products even start off as by-products of furniture, resulting in low cost furniture. Supply networkIkea acquires its suppliers through 'creative sourcing' from many different suppliers. FacilitiesIkea has limited its UK operations due to shortage of facilities of the right size, location and cost. It is this operations decision to use such facilities that contributes to the low cost and flexibility of the products. TechnologyIkea makes the following technology operations decisions to achieve levels of performance: Robots are used in the central warehouse, reducing the need for staff, resulting in lower costs. Conveyer belts at the checkouts enable large items to be transported past the cashier, improving quality of service for customers Inventory control is achieved through an integrated, automated computer system, resulting in flexibility in a reduction in stock-outs and therefore greater volume flexibility. Infrastructural Operations DecisionsWorkforce & organisation strategyThe people who staff Ikea should play a strong role in its management. 'To assume responsibility' is a philosophy of Ikea. All are expected to work together towards the organisation's objectives. The operations decision to have management wearing the same clothes as the rest of the staff helps to reach this objective. The division of roles is reached by employees either wearing red or grey sweatshirts, depending on whether they are customer contact or not. Capacity adjustment strategyIkea adjusts to fluctuations in demand by having a completely automated system of re-ordering. Stock-outs do occur, usually resulting in the buffer and re-order quantities being reviewed. Supplier development strategy'Creative sourcing' means that suppliers are sourced from many different countries and companies. This enables Ikea to achieve economies of scale and thus contributes to attaining the appropriate levels of performance in terms of cost. Inventory strategyIkea stores have automatic inventory management through a completely automated system of re-ordering. At present there is no warehouse capacity in the UK, and all products come from a central warehouse in Sweden, simplifying inventory. Improvement strategyBy continuously finding new creative sourcing of products and by involving all staff in the improvement process, the operations manages to implement an improvement strategy. Question One possible source of tension between marking and operations is the objective of marketing to have a 'Scandinavian Feel' to the designs of the furniture. The differences in taste between the different countries results in slow-moving items in some countries. The operations objective to source products from many different sources and countries, is limited to those products having a 'Scandinavian feel' and hence there is a tension between marketing and operations.""","""Ikea's operational performance strategy""","840","""Ikea, the globally renowned Swedish furniture retailer, has established itself as a leader in the industry not only for its innovative designs and affordable prices but also for its exceptional operational performance strategy. At the core of Ikea's successful operational performance lies a combination of efficiency, sustainability, forward-thinking strategies, and a customer-centric approach.  One of the key pillars of Ikea's operational performance strategy is its focus on cost leadership. By implementing efficient supply chain management practices, such as lean manufacturing and just-in-time inventory management, Ikea has been able to keep its costs low while maintaining high product quality. This allows the company to offer affordable prices to its customers without compromising on the design or functionality of its products.  Furthermore, Ikea is known for its flat-pack furniture concept, which not only reduces transportation costs and carbon footprint but also makes it easier for customers to transport and assemble the furniture themselves. This innovative approach to product packaging and distribution has been instrumental in driving down operational costs and improving overall efficiency.  In addition to cost leadership, Ikea places a strong emphasis on sustainability in its operational practices. The company has made significant investments in renewable energy sources, sustainable materials, and waste reduction initiatives to minimize its environmental impact. By integrating sustainability into its operations, Ikea not only appeals to environmentally conscious consumers but also reduces long-term operational costs by improving energy efficiency and reducing waste.  Ikea's operational performance strategy is also characterized by its forward-thinking approach to technology and innovation.

"6119","""Human African placed HAT within the ten major health problems facing mankind, alongside malaria, cancer, and heart, the East African variant caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and the West African variant caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. EpidemiologyHAT can be found in 6 countries in sub- Saharan Africa, which shows its importance as a human pathogen. During one year around 00 - 00,00 people develop the disease, there are 0,00 deaths, and 0 million people are at risk from the invade the CNS, known as the meningoencephalitic stage. The distinction between the haemolytic and meningoencephalitic stages is not always clear, especially in T. b. rodesiense infection where one stage may run into the, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis and typhoid. Spinal fluid concentration techniques include centrifugation followed by examination of the sediment. Taking the above into consideration, the most efficient way of determining whether a person has HAT is by identifying the trypanosomes in the peripheral blood or lymph node light microscopy. In T. b. rhodesiense disease it is quite easily done due to the persistent parasitaemia, but not so easily in T. b. gambiense where the parasitaemia is cyclical. When this method can't be applied, serological testing is carried out using the card agglutination trypanosomiasis in the CSF of >/l (WHO, 998). However, researchers in West Africa with T. b. gambiense disease have chosen to use a figure of >0/l in the CSF. Raised intrathecal IgM levels in the CSF have also been identified in HAT patients with late stage disease and suggests the possibility of CSF invasion. Therefore a latex agglutination test for IgM amounts has been successfully carried out in field conditions and has the potential both for detecting and monitoring HAT. TreatmentCurrently, there are no vaccines or drugs available to prevent infection of HAT. There are however, drugs available for treating it, but they are scarce, difficult to administer, and sometimes dangerous. One of the original drugs developed to combat sleeping sickness, atoxyl, contained arsenic and caused blindness in hundreds of patients in 932. A drug called melarsoprol was developed to prevent these side effects, and is currently the drug of choice for the final stage of the disease. Suramin, pentamidine, and berenil have been used to treat, and sometimes cure, within the haemolymphatic stages of the infection. The drug trybizine has tested successfully for East African sleeping sickness in research animals. Research and development of drugs could be considered minimal as they are intended to treat people in under-developed countries, and would not be considered to be a profitable venture by many pharmaceutical companies. Eflornithine, an anti-trypanosomal drug has been observed to be effective in treating late-stage T.b.gambiense infection. The drug is considered to be expensive and therefore not widely available to areas where HAT is endemic. However, in March 001, the World Health Organization reached an agreement with Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Dow Chemical, Akorn Manufacturing, and the French-German company Aventis to produce and donate 0,00 doses of eflornithine to help with efforts to combat HAT. Control measuresDue to the long symptom-free periods following infection, periodic screening would be a good way to go about detecting HAT and establish reliable estimates of incidence. Currently, screening is more focused on high-risk areas. As a result, reported cases under-represent the actual level of incidence. As screening and treatment are decreased or stopped in certain areas, the disease intensifies. In 999, 0,00-5/8,00 cases were reported, and only three to four million people were screened out of an estimated 0 million at risk. ( URL ). Economic and social factors make effective vector-control strategies difficult. There are successful vector control programs, but exist in less than % of the areas where the disease is shown some success. Transegenic techniques, such as introducing into tsetse flies foreign genes that will restrict the tsetse flies ability to survive, reproduce, or transmit pathogens, appear to be a promising area in research for the near future""","""Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT)""","910","""Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasites Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. This disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected tsetse flies found in sub-Saharan Africa, predominantly in rural areas. HAT affects some of the most vulnerable populations in Africa, with devastating consequences if left untreated. Understanding the causes, symptoms, stages, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and impact of HAT is crucial in combatting this significant public health concern.  Initially, the tsetse fly bite introduces the parasite into the bloodstream, where it multiplies and spreads to various body organs, including the central nervous system. The early stage of HAT is characterized by non-specific symptoms like fever, headache, joint pain, and itching. As the disease progresses, the parasites invade the central nervous system, leading to the neurological phase marked by confusion, poor coordination, sleep disturbances, and eventually leading to a coma, hence the term """"sleeping sickness.""""  There are two forms of HAT: Gambian HAT caused by T. b. gambiense and Rhodesian HAT caused by T. b. rhodesiense. Gambian HAT progresses more slowly, often taking months to years to manifest severe symptoms, while Rhodesian HAT progresses rapidly, with severe symptoms appearing within weeks to months of infection. The difference in progression impacts treatment strategies and patient outcomes.  Diagnosing HAT involves detecting the presence of the parasite in blood, lymph nodes, or cerebrospinal fluid. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for timely treatment initiation, as the disease may be fatal if left untreated. Treatment depends on the disease stage: early-stage patients usually receive less toxic medications, while those in the advanced stage require more complex treatments that can cross the blood-brain barrier to combat the central nervous system involvement.  The drugs used to treat HAT are often associated with significant side effects, and treatment regimens can be complex and vary based on the parasite species and disease stage. Challenges such as drug resistance and limited availability of medications in affected regions further complicate treatment efforts. Research into new drugs and improved treatment strategies is ongoing to address these challenges and improve patient outcomes.  Preventing HAT focuses on controlling and eliminating tsetse fly populations through vector control measures like insecticide-treated targets, traps, and cattle treatments. Additionally, raising awareness about the disease among at-risk populations and ensuring early diagnosis and treatment play a crucial role in disease prevention and control. Collaboration between governments, non-governmental organizations, and international partners is essential to combat HAT effectively.  The impact of HAT extends beyond health, affecting socio-economic development in endemic regions. The disease primarily affects rural populations dependent on agriculture and livestock, leading to decreased productivity, poverty, and social disruption. By addressing HAT, not only can lives be saved, but the overall well-being and prosperity of affected communities can be enhanced.  In conclusion, Human African Trypanosomiasis is a complex disease that requires a multifaceted approach involving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. Addressing the underlying causes of HAT, such as poverty, limited healthcare access, and inadequate resources, is vital in the fight against this neglected tropical disease. Through sustained efforts and international collaboration, it is possible to reduce the burden of HAT and improve the health and well-being of those at risk in endemic regions.""","705"
"33","""An infinite number of inferences are made throughout our lives whether or not we are consciously aware of it. The process by which we use our knowledge to make these inferences is known as reasoning. We use reasoning in nearly everything - from solving mathematical conundrums to finding the way to a particular destination. It is of no surprise then, that the mechanisms of reasoning are of such interest to psychologists. Previous research has led some psychologists to conclude that inferences are drawn through the means of parallel, associative links while others argue that reasoning is based on the application of systematic rules. In an effort to make sense of the gap between these two perspectives, yet other researchers propose that there are in fact two co-existing systems of reasoning. Sloman is one of the proponents of such a dual systems theory. His dichotomy consists of the associative system and the rule-based system. Sloman describes the associative system as one which operates using similarity and temporal relations. Similarities between objects are used to form correlations and inferences are derived based on an underlying statistical structure. Unlike the rule-based system, inferences drawn by this form of computation are quick, automatic and ranked more probable than 'Linda is a bank teller' (T). This shows that judgement was made based on the degree of similarity between the descriptive paragraph and the statements about Linda. However, according to rational reasoning, the probability of T&F cannot be higher than T because a conjunction can never be more probable than one of its constituents. When this was pointed out to the participants, most of them seemed to accept this logic. Therefore, there must be two mechanisms of equal psychological force which lead to opposing answers. An associative heuristic picks out T&F as being more likely while a chain of reasoning reveals T as more cause individual differences in reasoning. Stanovich & West proposed that this hypothesis could be tested by measuring the relationship between cognitive capacity and performance on a reasoning task. A strong correlation would imply that algorithmic level limitations might hinder those of lower cognitive capacity from producing a normative response. Stanovich & West calculated the correlation between SAT total eight different reasoning tasks and concluded that to a certain extent, the failure to conform to the normative model seems to be caused by variation in computational limitations at the algorithmic level. Hence, contradictory responses to a judgement task could be attributed to the inability of participants to carry out rule-based reasoning with their limited cognitive capacity rather than a second reasoning system. Alternatively, it could be argued that systematic errors in reasoning may occur not because of cognitive limitations on the part of participants but rather due to the application of the wrong normative model by experimenters. According to this perspective, responses to tasks such as those put forward by Tversky and Kahneman are not seen as non-normative. Instead, of the opinion that when the answers given by normative theories are systematically rejected, it could be a sign that the normative theory is inadequate. As Margolis argues, in the 'Linda Problem' it is Tversky and Kahneman and not their participants who do not understand the logic of the problem. Gigirenzeral. (991; cited in Stanovich & West, 000) explained that under some conceptions of probability, the judgements involved in this problem are not subject to the rules of a probability calculus. Research seems to strongly indicate that there are two systems of reasoning. A dual systems theory not only successfully explains why a reasoning problem may produce such different responses but also why two opposing inferences arising from a single situation may seem so compelling at the same time. This is an area that theories based on a normative model fall short. Attributing the differences between normative and descriptive models to computational limitations is a legitimate strategy. However, this perspective implies that given enough time and cognitive aid, individuals should eventually come to realise that the normative response is the only logical one. Sloman showed that this is untrue and that people continue to consider their initial response in a given situation. Besides that, while the alternative perspectives that have been explored are plausible, they do not refute the existence of an additional associative reasoning system and seem far from absolute. They also fail to account for additional characteristics of reasoning such as why some inferences are arrived at automatically, almost instantly, and in a manner that is undemanding of cognitive capacity while others are controlled and highly demanding on cognitive capacity. One cannot say with complete certainty that there are two systems of reasoning. However, the bulk of evidence seems to suggest so. Furthermore, other theories which have been considered are by no means superior or more successful. Ultimately, the exact mechanisms of reasoning cannot be completely agreed upon until more conclusive research is carried out.""","""Mechanisms of reasoning and inference""","946","""Mechanisms of reasoning and inference are fundamental cognitive processes that humans utilize daily to make sense of the world around them. Reasoning involves the mental processes of forming conclusions, judgments, or inferences from facts or premises, while inference involves drawing conclusions or making predictions based on evidence or reasoning. These mechanisms are crucial for problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking across various disciplines such as science, mathematics, philosophy, and everyday life.  One of the key mechanisms of reasoning is deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning involves deriving specific conclusions from general principles or premises. This type of reasoning follows a logical structure where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. For example, if all humans are mortal (premise) and Socrates is a human (premise), then it logically follows that Socrates is mortal (conclusion). Deductive reasoning is often used in mathematics and formal logic where conclusions are certain if the premises are true.  On the other hand, inductive reasoning involves making generalizations based on specific observations or patterns. Inductive reasoning moves from specific instances to broader conclusions, which may not be definitely true even if the premises are true. For example, observing that the sun has risen every day in the past leads to the conclusion that the sun will rise tomorrow. Inductive reasoning is used in scientific research, where hypotheses are formed based on observations and empirical data.  Abductive reasoning is another mechanism that involves forming the best explanation or hypothesis for a set of observations or evidence. This form of reasoning is used when there are multiple possible explanations, and the goal is to identify the most likely or plausible one. Abductive reasoning is common in detective work, diagnosis in medicine, and scientific inference where the best explanation is sought based on available evidence.  Reasoning by analogy is a mechanism where similarities between two or more things are identified to make inferences. By recognizing similarities between known and unknown situations, one can draw conclusions about the unknown based on what is known. For example, if a new virus behaves similarly to a known virus, one can infer how the new virus might spread or behave based on the existing knowledge.  Another important mechanism is probabilistic reasoning, where likelihoods or probabilities are assigned to different outcomes or events. This type of reasoning involves considering uncertainty and using probabilities to make decisions or predictions. Probabilistic reasoning is prevalent in fields such as statistics, economics, and artificial intelligence, where uncertainty is inherent.  Logical reasoning involves using formal systems of rules and principles to determine the validity of arguments. By applying rules of logic such as modus ponens or modus tollens, one can evaluate the soundness of arguments and draw valid conclusions. Logical reasoning is crucial for identifying fallacies, inconsistencies, or contradictions in arguments.  It's essential to recognize that cognitive biases and heuristics can influence reasoning and inference. Biases such as confirmation bias, availability heuristic, or anchoring effect can lead to errors in judgment and decision-making. Being aware of these biases and employing critical thinking skills can help mitigate their impact on reasoning processes.  In conclusion, mechanisms of reasoning and inference are essential cognitive processes that underpin human intelligence and problem-solving abilities. By understanding and harnessing different types of reasoning mechanisms, individuals can enhance their analytical skills, make better decisions, and navigate complex information more effectively in various aspects of life and academic disciplines. Developing proficiency in reasoning and inference is not only intellectually stimulating but also empowers individuals to think critically and engage with the world more thoughtfully.""","699"
"6020","""'Only a few centuries ago the English language consisted of a collection of dialects spoken mainly by monolinguals and only within the shores of a small island' (Cheshire 991:). However by 002, it was estimated by 'well over a third of the world's population' had some command of the English the expanding, Hong Kong 'came under British control as a result of the Opium wars with China,' it was ceded to Britain in 842 by the Treaty of Nanking and was officially leased from China in 898 for ninety nine the sole purpose of facilitating or reinforcing trade and commerce' (Li 003: 7). In addition, unlike other colonisers, the administration delivered non intrusive ideals which the Chinese had aspired to since the times of out that these kinds of socio-economic trends did not 'conform to the usual pattern of colonisation' and therefore has greatly shaped the development of English in Hong Kong. The Introduction and Development of English In Hong Kong According to Jenkins for the first one hundred years of British rule the British and Chinese led relatively separate lives; coexisting alongside each other and only interacting for the purposes of business and trade. This led to 'the development in the eighteenth century of Chinese Pidgin English' (Pennington 998: 5/8) which actually survived right through to the twentieth century. However this was not the English promoted by the British administrators, as it was a mix of English derived vocabulary and Cantonese grammar as: 'Boy! Makee pay my that two piecee book' ('Give me those two books boy!)In spite of the use on non standard British English, Pennington points out that the pidgin did flourish in the early period of British rule, although not as a lingua franca, as most Chinese would speak Cantonese. Instead it was a language which was employed to trade with powerful foreigners. However that 'by the early twentieth access to educated varieties of English through mission schools and other sources and some Chinese speakers of English developed a distaste for pidgin,' resulting in its decline. British English was promoted through its use in the law, administrative institutions; a common practice for many of the British colonies in the second was partly as a result of 'the colonial government's social selection policies' which had implications for those citizens who were proficient in English, enabling them to have access to higher paid and more prestigious jobs than those who had little or no knowledge. English had become a competitive advantage providing higher social status and increased opportunity. However as Li points out, far from providing opportunities for everyone, English became a perpetuator of social divide. This is because it was only the middle and higher social classes who could afford the private education needed to reach the required standard in English, therefore creating a privileged elite of Chinese Hong Kongese who were closely tied to the British centre. Yet in spite of this unequal distribution the number of English speakers has increased since the1970s with the introduction of educational legislation which provided a free and compulsory education 'belatedly realistic given that Putonghua, the mainland standard of spoken Mandarin, is the national language in all of China, which now again includes Hong Kong.' Indeed, after 997 the strength of English in education was weakened when it was decided in 998 that secondary education should be conducted in Cantonese. However due to public demand 00 schools were permitted to continue using English as the medium of instruction. Yet even this did not subside the public outcry which followed as: 'This has caused an outcry amongst parents and alumni of some of the schools forced to change to Chinese medium. Letters appear in the papers daily, with angry protests from parents or heartrending appeals from pupils to be allowed free choice in the matter of medium of instruction.' But was this a response conditioned by imperialism? Phillipson argues that it was, citing the influence of the colonisers which was maintained even after their physical presence had gone: 'The ideal way to make people do what you want is of course to make them want it themselves, and to make them believe that it is good for them' (Phillipson 992: 86). It is possible to see the truth in Phillipson's argument as in Hong Kong, English is and has historically been viewed as desirable; 'a value added commodity' (Li 001: 4). However, whether this opinion is justified or whether it is a tool to perpetuate neo colonialism is unclear and difficult to clarify. For example Brutt- to the genuine importance and economic benefit of English speakers in commercial colonies such as Hong Kong, especially with a growing service industry that is dependent on an international lingua franca such as English. Conversely though it would be naive and selective to think that there was no evidence of linguistic imperialism during the colonial era and that it ended as soon as the handover took place. For instance a typical example is the language policy which benefited English speakers, putting those who were not proficient in English at a distinct social and economic disadvantage. Ultimately though I agree with concluded that: 'there is no way that an elite who have mastered the colonial language can hope to create and sustain a strong desire among the ex-colonial subjects to learn that language willingly if there is no incentive for them to learn Kong parents are not passive victims but pragmatically-minded active agents acting in their best interests.'English And It's Impact On Other Languages The introduction and development of any foreign language, (in this case English) in any country and for whatever reason will inevitably have some impact on the existing indigenous languages, and Hong Kong of course is no exception as I have already highlighted. However unlike many other British is little evidence to suggest that the introduction of English has been at the cost of other languages. For instance, that 'one of the clearest indicators of English linguistic imperialism in former British or American colonies is that the vitality or existence of local languages is under threat.' Yet Cantonese is in a period of continual: 'in personal domains such as family, friends, social use of English is superseded by Cantonese.' It is also the predominant medium of instruction in most well as having a growing influence within the government and the law, where it is the norm for spoken interaction to take place in has grown, citing that it is 'becoming more and more important in administration and for interaction with people from the rest of China.' It has indeed benefited from the governmental strategy to pursue a 'trilingual, biliterate language policy that recognises Cantonese, Putonghua and English as spoken languages and written Chinese and English as written languages' (Bolton 002: ), but in spite of these measures there are some concerns for its future which Boyle raises. For instance, 'many Continental Chinese prefer to use English as a means of communication rather than having the Hong Kong person struggling in bad Putonghua or themselves attempting Cantonese. (Secondly) some Continental Chinese, especially those from Beijing and Shanghai want to use and improve their considered to be a symbol of Chinese modernity and affluence.' (Boyle 998: 8)So far I have examined the consequences of English on other languages but perhaps the most profound influence of English in Hong Kong is the way it has contributed to mixed codes. Crystal points to this as one of the characterising features of New Englishes highlighting in particular a mixed code between Tagalog and English which is exemplified in the following excerpt from a leaflet issued by the Hong Kong Bank: 'mag-deposito ng pera mula sa ibang HongKong Bank account, at any HongKong Bank ATM using your cashcard. Mag-transfer ng regularamount bawa't shows the way in which English is integrated with indigenous languages to form a new as it is an illustration of 'the extent to which it is possible to go and still retain an identity which is at least partly English.' This is only one example of code mixing however, for instance 'Yinglish' has also been that although 'indecipherable to people outside Hong spoken by taxi drivers, tailors, Indian business people and anyone positioned between the Cantonese and English speaking communities,' thus demonstrating that code mixing is not necessarily confined to the uneducated or to certain social groups but restricted to a geographical area, conditioned only by the surrounding linguistic profile. Indeed, points to a study showing the growth of 'mixed mode' in Hong Kong classrooms. In the nineteen eighties mixed mode teaching grew from nine per cent to twenty per cent and in subjects such as science and mathematics it had even become the 'dominant mode' (Pennington 998: 7). by reaffirming Hong Kong's most important linguistic feature: 'The most significant fact about Hong Kong language in the present era is the vitality of the mixed code which has resulted from this process of linguistic flooding, diluting and blending and which in a sense carries on the traditions of the previous generations of pidgin speakers.' The Future of Hong Kong EnglishSo what to the future of Hong Kong English as perhaps a new variety of English? This seems a little far off and to explain why perhaps once more Hong Kong's unusual relationship with English must be considered. For instance Jenkins states that 'despite the growth in English amongst the Hong appears that Hong Kong English does not have widespread acceptance as a variety,' pointing to the norms to which Hong Kong learners try to follow: 'it's existence is acknowledged, but it is apparently not the variety to which Hong Kong English speakers aspire. teachers remain firmly attached to British English norms of correctness' (Jenkins 003: 36). This employment of exonormative standards instigated and perpetuated by an educated demonstrates some form of post colonial imperialism, as described by Phillipson whereby the enforcing of the coloniser's norms only serve to reinforce the coloniser's influence. Yet it may also be argued that without a standardised International language the need to follow Inner circle norms is stronger than ever in order to gain from the international opportunities which English can offer. Whatever the reasons behind Hong Kong's exonormative stance however, without the codification and acceptance of Hong Kong English its place as a new variety of English looks to be uncertain. Conclusion In this assignment I hope to have provided an account of how English was brought to Hong Kong and the conditioning factors under which it developed. I have also described its effect on other languages as well as considering what the future may hold for English in a post colonial Hong Kong. Although the account has been relatively brief and there are many issues that I have not been able to touch upon I hope that I have at least pointed to the most significant developments and issues concerning its progression. My information is from a range of sources to avoid a bias approach, although inevitably this is very difficult when researching a former British colony because as 'whoever writes history is likely to be defending the interests of the group the historian belongs to,' as a result I have tried to neutralise this effect by selecting texts and accounts written by academics based both in and outside of Hong Kong. Similarly there are problems with the reliability of the estimated figures of the number of speakers of English, as they are beset with the inevitable problems of approximation and definition, but whatever the number of English speakers in Hong Kong it is clear that English has had an enormous impact on not only the teachers and students of English but on other languages, and the history of Hong Kong.""","""English Language Development in Hong Kong""","2308","""English Language Development in Hong Kong: English Language Development (ELD) in Hong Kong holds significant importance due to its status as a global financial hub and cultural melting pot where multilingualism is prevalent. The city's historical background as a British colony has shaped its linguistic landscape, making English a prominent language alongside Cantonese and Mandarin. This unique linguistic environment has led to the necessity of fostering strong English language skills among Hong Kong's population to maintain its competitive edge in the global arena.  Hong Kong's educational system plays a pivotal role in nurturing English proficiency among its residents. English is one of the official languages of Hong Kong, and it is taught as a core subject in schools from an early age. Students are exposed to English language instruction starting from primary school, with a focus on developing listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. The government places a strong emphasis on bilingualism and promotes the use of English in various sectors to enhance international communication and opportunities for its citizens.  To support English Language Development, Hong Kong has a robust network of language learning resources and programs. Schools often integrate language learning tools and technology into their curriculum to engage students effectively. Additionally, initiatives such as the Native-speaking English Teacher (NET) Scheme bring qualified English teachers from English-speaking countries to local schools, providing students with exposure to authentic language use and cultural exchange.  The prevalence of English in Hong Kong extends beyond the educational realm and permeates various aspects of society. English is widely used in business, finance, tourism, and other professional fields, making it essential for individuals seeking career advancement and international opportunities. Proficiency in English not only enhances one's employability but also facilitates interactions with a diverse global audience, fostering a more interconnected and inclusive community.  Despite the efforts to promote English Language Development, challenges persist in achieving fluency and proficiency among Hong Kong residents. The bilingual nature of the society sometimes leads to a blending of languages, resulting in a unique linguistic phenomenon known as """"code-switching."""" This practice, while reflecting the cultural diversity of Hong Kong, can pose challenges for individuals striving to master English as a second language.  Another challenge in English Language Development is the need to address the disparity in English proficiency levels among different socioeconomic groups. Students from privileged backgrounds often have greater access to English enrichment programs and resources, giving them an advantage in acquiring language skills. Bridging this gap requires targeted interventions to provide equal opportunities for all individuals to develop their English proficiency regardless of their socioeconomic status.  In response to these challenges, stakeholders in Hong Kong continue to implement strategies to enhance English Language Development across the population. Public awareness campaigns, professional development opportunities for educators, and community engagement initiatives are some of the measures undertaken to promote a culture of lifelong learning and language acquisition.  The future of English Language Development in Hong Kong is intertwined with the city's aspirations to maintain its global relevance and competitiveness. As international communication and collaboration become increasingly vital in a connected world, the ability to communicate effectively in English will be a valuable asset for individuals and the city as a whole. By investing in language education, embracing linguistic diversity, and fostering a supportive learning environment, Hong Kong can continue to strengthen its position as a multilingual and inclusive society on the global stage.""","639"
"123","""Strategic management is the key to success and standing out from the crowd under the competitive business. It is therefore necessary for a business to implement the appropriate long-term strategic plans whilst having the flexibility to tackle developing changes. The discussion which follows will address on the execution of long and short term strategic planning. The importance of the two will critically analyze. Long term strategic planning generally means an idea is developed in a structured, formalized process as well as the organization will use it in the coming years. In the process of executing the planning, organization should first familiar with the internal situation of the company like structure, systems, a motto for a business. With reference to the data analyzed, an organization will set the long-term strategic planning which align business objectives and is in favor of the benefits of the company as a whole. As suggested by Steiner, 'all strategies must be broken down into sub strategies for successful implementation' (Steiner, 979:77). Evaluating the strategic planning is crucial because managers can make the adjustment before it is implemented. If everything is fine, the strategic planning can be launched. During setting the long-term strategic planning, firm will keep updating the information to beware of the sudden changes in market. To trace the fashion and the latest taste of the customers, they may hold the target group discussions, do surveys on the street, and telephone interviews. Participating in different kinds of social or exhibition let organization update the movement of the industry. For the rest of the changes, for example the government policy, economic, politics or other factors which affect them. They may depend on the media globally for example the Financial others and some critics or scholars who familiar with particular area. Once changes emerge, managers will reconsider and set their short-term direction immediately. Wit mentioned and used the Fig to explain that strategic renewal which constantly enacts strategic changes to remain in harmony with external conditions; it can transform for the firm to stay up to date and Boddy mentioned. Besides the main long-term strategic planning for the entire company, there will be other tailor-made sub strategic planning in the area of multinational, organizing, production, marketing, human resource management, political risk and negotiation in order to provide a clearer goal to the different parties within the company. When staff members acknowledge the present and future situation of company, they can straightly go ahead. If there is any unpredictable changes appear they can still work towards the planning with their flexibility. In reality, most companies are using both long-term planning and flexibility. However, part of them may rely more on the flexibility than on the planning while the others may be different; it may due to the difference of companies or industries. Legal and General, a company in FTSE 00, is an example of demanding more on flexibility. Legal & General provides insurance to protect their clients from the risks as a 'consistent aim' (Legal & General, 005/8). Over many years, they have extended their range of services and products to meet the market needs and take a strong role in developing the economy, technology and even the satellites in aims to bring travellers around the world with comfort and safety and BA has put lots of effort on advancing the airport and in-flight service, e-ticketing and other business or first-class service. However, it is still relying more on long term strategic planning than the flexibility relatively. One may ask which discipline is more important to the company; it is still a controversial argument. Actually, each company has its own practice; but if an organization aims to bring the most value for their shareholders. It can be considered that flexible to the emerging changes is more crucial for their success. It is hard to be a good 'Fortune teller' but is easier to be flexible or find some parties to help in changing.To undertake strategic planning; an organization has to predict the future to provide a general trend which the society is moving to. While the certain repetitive be predictable, the forecasting of discontinuities, such as technological breakthroughs or price increases, is 'practically impossible' (Makridakis, 990) according to Spiro Makridakis. As well as, not all alternatives can be listed in the planning in advance. If one does not flexible, rivals may catch up or grow even faster. According to Dean R. Fowler, one of the characteristic which contribute to the successful family business strategy is flexibility because they can respond to the market, make decision quickly and 'speed to out-maneuver the competition' (Fowler, 001).Therefore, if an organization can take this example as learning material, they may also can respond to customer orders quickly, provide a broader product range quickly. 'Flexibility has been recognized as an important competitive priority in manufacturing strategy literature'. (Dangayach, 001). Flexibility does not mean to change the whole strategic planning. It can be just a 'fine tuning', whereby existing procedures are upgraded, activities are improved and people are reassigned. Operational changed are directed at increasing the performance of the firm under the existing system and the current basic setup (Wit, 005/8:3). Asda is one of cases and precursors in changing their strategies so as to cope with and grow along with the external environment. During the 980s, the development and usage of computer increase. Asda, the major food retailer, not only developed strategies of opening new stores, refurnishing the existing stores and changing the product variation but also pursued strategy of using information technology and streamlining their distribution system (Thompson, 993:2).Virgin group's directors aim to develop company into the leading British international media and entertainment group and they are confident that by recognizing changes in consumer tastes Virgin can expand successfully and profitably in this field (Thompson, 993:6-8). From the about cases, they tell the importance of flexibility. Mintzberg mentioned that strategy 'need not always be a conscious and precise plan'. Indeed, he argues, 'strategy can emerge as a pattern from a fits-and-starts stream of entrepreneurial actions' (Mintzberg, 982). He also argues that organizations should be structured and managed to ensure that formulators of strategies have information, and that implementers of strategies and changes have the appropriate degree of power to ensure that the desired changes are brought about (Mintzberg, 989). By some means, there are many uncertainties in the markets; they should have an emergency plan to cope with while go along with the long term strategy plan. Manager should be flexible and need to foresee the obstacles in the future. Always reviewing the strategy is needed. It would be true especially for the business which concentrate on the long- term strategic planning only and neglect about the changing markets. At the same time, if they only focus on the instant varying market situation and do not have a broad vision, it is not easy either for the organization to be succeed in the long-run.""","""Strategic Management and Flexibility""","1403","""Strategic management and flexibility are crucial elements in today's dynamic and competitive business environment. Strategic management involves the formulation and implementation of plans and initiatives to achieve long-term goals and sustain a competitive advantage. On the other hand, flexibility refers to an organization's ability to adapt and respond to changes in the internal and external environment quickly. This article will delve into the importance of strategic management and flexibility, how they complement each other, and their impact on organizational success.  Strategic management is about setting clear objectives, analyzing the competitive landscape, making informed decisions, and aligning resources to achieve the desired outcomes. It involves assessing the organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis) to develop strategies that leverage strengths, mitigate weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and counter threats. Strategic management provides a roadmap for the organization, guiding decision-making at all levels and ensuring that everyone is working towards common goals.  Flexibility, on the other hand, is the ability to adjust and adapt to changing circumstances rapidly. In today's fast-paced business environment, organizations face constant challenges such as technological advancements, changing customer preferences, regulatory changes, and economic fluctuations. Flexibility allows organizations to respond to these challenges effectively, seize new opportunities, and stay ahead of the competition. It enables organizations to pivot quickly, innovate, and stay relevant in a rapidly changing market.  Strategic management and flexibility are interconnected concepts that work hand in hand to drive organizational success. While strategic management provides a structured framework for decision-making and goal-setting, flexibility allows organizations to implement changes swiftly and make course corrections as needed. A strategic plan that lacks flexibility may become obsolete quickly if it does not account for unforeseen events or changes in the business environment. On the other hand, flexibility without a solid strategic foundation can lead to ad-hoc decision-making and lack of coherence in organizational actions.  Incorporating flexibility into strategic management involves building resilience and adaptive capacity within the organization. This can be achieved by fostering a culture of innovation, empowering employees to make decisions, investing in training and development, and leveraging technology to streamline processes. Organizations that embrace flexibility can respond proactively to change, identify new opportunities, and stay resilient in the face of uncertainty.  One of the key benefits of combining strategic management with flexibility is the ability to navigate uncertainty and complexity effectively. By having a clear strategic direction and being flexible in execution, organizations can adapt to changing market conditions, customer needs, and competitive pressures. This enables them to stay agile, responsive, and competitive in an ever-evolving business landscape.  Moreover, the integration of strategic management and flexibility enhances organizational performance and drives sustainable growth. By aligning strategic goals with flexible execution, organizations can optimize resource allocation, minimize risks, and capitalize on emerging trends. This synergy allows organizations to leverage their core competencies while exploring new opportunities for growth and expansion.  Strategic management and flexibility also play a critical role in fostering innovation and creativity within organizations. A well-defined strategic vision provides a framework for innovation, while flexibility allows for experimentation, learning from failure, and adapting strategies based on feedback. This iterative process of innovation helps organizations stay ahead of the curve and drive continuous improvement in products, services, and processes.  In conclusion, strategic management and flexibility are essential components of organizational success in today's dynamic business environment. By combining strategic foresight with the ability to adapt quickly to change, organizations can navigate uncertainty, drive innovation, and achieve sustainable growth. Investing in both strategic management processes and fostering a culture of flexibility can position organizations to thrive in an ever-changing marketplace.""","707"
"104","""The sense of humour and humour expression exist in every culture. Individuals who have greater sense of humour are usually thought to have better interaction with others and have better mental health. A high association between sense of humour and better psychosocial adjustment has been found in cancer administered within the first three weeks of term two; the second administered twelve months after Time. A minimum of 00 subjects completed both the Time and Time questionnaires will be required. According to the information from the International Office, the mean age of international students is 5/8 years once at the second to enhance relationships at the expense of their social support. The statements describe certain helpful behaviours that might help a sojourner stay in Singapore easier or more pleasant. Sample items include: Listen and talk with you whenever you feel lonely or depressed? (Emotional support); Explain and help you understand the local culture and language. (Tangible assistance). Respondents use a -point rating scale: = no one would do this, =many would do this. A higher score indicates greater perceived availability of supportive behaviour. Sociocultural AdaptationSociocultural adaptation is assessed with a 9-item measure of the Sociocultural Adaptation used for rating; higher scores reflect more sociocultural adaptation problems. Well-beingSubject's well-being is measured by the Affect Balance is a 0-item rating scale including five statements phrasing positive feelings and five statements phrasing negative feelings. It was designed to evaluate present psychological well-being. Respondents reply either yes or no to each item. The sample questions are: 'Did you feel particularly excited or interested in something?';' Depressed or very unhappy?'. Scores range from, the lowest affect balance to 0, the highest affect balance. ANALYSISThe statistical analysis method of this study is still under development. The basic idea is, the quantitative data from both Time and Time2 included participants' demographic information, the LOT-R, the HSQ, the extroversion sub-scale of BFI, the ISSS, the SCAS and the Affect Balance Scale will be collected. Then I will use descriptive statistics to generalize the basic information of study sample (mean age, gender, race and duration of staying U.K, etc.). Furthermore, correlational analysis will be used to look for correlations between perceived social support, self report social cultural adaptation, subjective well-being and humor styles scores. Hypothesis testing will be done to determine whether humour style has high correlation to better development of social relationships and adjustment to a foreign culture? How does this relate to people's well-being? DISCUSSION ABOUT METHODOLOGYAs I mentioned in the introduction, I chose the non-experimental design to carry out this study for reasons below: First, the natural of the variables that I want to study is not observable. For example, intercultural adaptation is an abstract issue. What is a 'good adaptation'? How do we observe an individual's adaptation condition from his or her behaviour is really a difficult issue. Second, the intervention in my study, which should be controlled in an experimental design, is the natural setting itself. When we discuss the intercultural adjustment of people from different corners of the earth living in a new environment, we encounter the difficulty to 'create' the same intervention as a different culture. Third, we can expect the relationships between variables will be very complicated. It is nearly impossible to obtain a one-way causal inference to interpret the relation. Therefore I rather choose a non-experimental design to investigate the phenomenon. Fourth, the Pretest-Posttest Design can establish a wider scope of interpretation. We can examine how humour and social adaptation change over time and see if people with sense of humor have better social support and better adaptation after three months. How about using a quasi-experimental design, namely, nonequivalent control group design in this study? The nonequivalent control group design has the advantage of providing a comparison group. Comparison group also improves controlling for changes that may be due to time or other causes. In this study, it is impossible to use the design because we cannot find a comparison group that does not face different culture and ask them to complete the measure of their intercultural adjustment. However, to enhance the external validity, we could have two groups that include adults moving to other country for working and younger adults entering new schools to see their humour style and the relation to adjustment. STUDY LIMITATIONSThere are several limitations to the proposed study. First, the personal characteristics of the subjects may be limited to a specific set due to the recruitment procedure. It is also possible that maladapted students do not have time or desire to take part in the study, which may bias my findings. Besides, the research environment may be lack of control because subjects are assessed through the Internet. Second, the first data will be collected at the beginning of term two, which is later than the beginning of academic year, lead to incorrect baseline value. Therefore the participants' basic mental status and their adaptation condition are unknown. It could have some confounding factors that would influence the results. Also, some maladapted students will not be included in the research because they could have discontinued schooling. Finally, the HSQ has seven response options, which may be confusing for some participants. Social desirability response bias must also be considered. Despite these limitations and potential problems from this study, this preliminary research has vast potential and great innovation in humour study within the positive psychology field.""","""Humor and sociocultural adaptation research""","1106","""Humor has long been recognized as a universal phenomenon that transcends cultural boundaries, serving as a powerful tool for social interaction and psychological well-being. In the realm of sociocultural adaptation research, the role of humor has garnered increasing interest and significance, as scholars aim to understand how humor influences individuals' adjustment to new cultural environments. This exploration delves into the multifaceted relationship between humor and sociocultural adaptation, shedding light on its mechanisms and implications for individuals navigating diverse cultural contexts.  At its core, humor serves as a social lubricant that fosters connections and eases tensions in interpersonal interactions. When individuals engage in humor, whether through jokes, playful banter, or comedic expressions, they create a shared space of light-heartedness that transcends linguistic and cultural barriers. In the context of cross-cultural adaptation, humor plays a vital role in bridging cultural differences and facilitating communication between individuals from diverse backgrounds. By sharing jokes or humorous anecdotes, individuals can build rapport, establish common ground, and navigate cultural misunderstandings with ease.  Moreover, humor serves as a coping mechanism in times of stress and adversity, a particularly salient function in the context of sociocultural adaptation. Moving to a new country or adapting to a different cultural environment can be emotionally taxing, as individuals grapple with unfamiliar norms, customs, and social dynamics. Humor, with its inherent ability to alleviate tension and provide psychological relief, becomes a valuable resource for individuals undergoing the process of adaptation. Through humor, individuals can reframe challenging situations, cope with culture shock, and find solace in moments of discomfort or alienation.  Research in the field of sociocultural adaptation has increasingly recognized the importance of humor in shaping individuals' experiences and outcomes in multicultural settings. Studies have shown that individuals who engage in humor as a coping strategy during cross-cultural transitions exhibit higher levels of psychological well-being, lower levels of stress, and greater overall satisfaction with their adaptation process. Furthermore, humor has been identified as a key factor in fostering intercultural communication competence, as individuals who employ humor effectively are better equipped to navigate cultural nuances, overcome communication barriers, and build relationships across cultural divides.  Additionally, humor serves as a form of cultural currency, allowing individuals to demonstrate cultural fluency and adaptability in new environments. By understanding and utilizing humor specific to a particular cultural context, individuals can signal their awareness of cultural norms, values, and taboos, thereby enhancing their social integration and acceptance within the host culture. Humor becomes a means of demonstrating cultural competence, fostering mutual understanding, and bridging the gap between insiders and outsiders in a given cultural setting.  While the benefits of humor in sociocultural adaptation are clear, it is essential to recognize that the perception and interpretation of humor can vary significantly across cultures. What may be considered humorous and appropriate in one cultural context may be perceived as offensive or inappropriate in another. As such, individuals navigating cross-cultural transitions must exercise cultural sensitivity and awareness when employing humor as a social strategy. Understanding the cultural nuances of humor, being attuned to diverse forms of comedic expression, and navigating potential language barriers are crucial skills for successful sociocultural adaptation.  In conclusion, humor plays a significant role in shaping individuals' experiences of sociocultural adaptation, serving as a powerful tool for building connections, coping with stress, and navigating cultural differences. Through its ability to foster communication, alleviate tension, and demonstrate cultural competence, humor emerges as a key factor in promoting successful adaptation to new cultural environments. By embracing humor as a universal language that transcends cultural divides, individuals can navigate the complexities of cross-cultural transitions with resilience, empathy, and a sense of shared humanity.""","731"
"229","""Modernism is surely the most indefinable movement of the twentieth century. As critics have remarked, it is a concept which 'incorporates major contradictions'. However, a key factor in our understanding of modernism is an awareness of the socio-political, cultural and scientific context of its conception. If we are to define it as a movement which, as Peter Childs argues, was 'primarily located in the years 890-930', then there are many notable developments which took place in Germany during this period crucial to the birth of modernism. Indeed, death contributed greatly to this birth. According to one website, ',73,00' soldiers died and '1,00,00 mobilized' and ',16,00 injured' men arrived home in the defeated Germany in 914. More positively, the 919 National Constitutional Assembly elections led to the 'right to vote' being given to women, who, six years later, represented over a third of the working population. Moreover, female emancipation occurred not only in political and professional realms, but also in the sphere of sexual relationships. The creation of 'die neue Frau' was influenced by the 'free sexuality' encouraged by the Berlin and Munich cabaret scenes; in addition, the arrival of sexual health clinics meant that women were no longer confined to the roles of housewife and mother imposed on them by the former Imperial state. Indeed, Weimar Germany embraced the presence of both low and high culture, just as it questioned the hierarchy inherent in the German marriage, as Theodor Van der Velde's guide to marriage, Die volkommene Ehe, testifies. In contrast to the artistically dubious cabaret, several creative movements, some essentially part of Modernism, others in conflict with it, formed throughout Europe in the early twentieth century. In Germany, one can note the concept of the 'socially critical' Neue Sachlichkeit, Expressionism and its focus on the highly personal subjectivity of the emotions, as well as the Expressionist painters who formed 'die Bruecke' and 'die blaue Reiter' groups, and the Bauhaus movement, with its admiration of the New York skyscrapers. Meanwhile, figures such as Einstein, Planck, Max Born and Johnny von Neumann were making progress in the scientific world. It is these socio-political, cultural and scientific advancements which I shall consider in analysing the extent to which Metropolis and Der blaue Engel can be called modernist. Steve Blandford, Barry Keith Grant, Jim Hillier, The Film Studies Fritz Lang in an American interview, specific source unknown, p13. An analysis of the Modernist mentality in the context of Der blaue Engel generates many ideas in common with the Modernist tendencies of Metropolis. Both films explore the Modernist thinker Freud's idea that the male fears castration at the hands of the female. Stephen Jenkins testifies to this in relation to Metropolis and its depiction of 'the Technosexual Woman': Janet Lungstrum, 'Metropolis and the Technosexual Woman of German Modernity', Women in the Metropolis, Ankum, pp.28-44. threatening aspect, as an evocation of the fear of castration, is also stressed. When extends a hand towards Fredersen he backs away, and we learn that Rotwang has actually lost a hand during the creation of the machine.Jenkins, Lang: Fear and Desire, p84. This fear of castration is evidently genetic, as it is experienced not only by Fredersen, but also by Freder. While many critics have analysed his work on the 'Clock Machine' in religious, allegorical terms, reading it in terms of his representation of Jesus and therefore seeing it as a crucifixion, equally, particularly considering the common view that technology is feminised is Metropolis, his suffering at the hands of this clock clearly symbolises his fear of being castrated at the hands of the female. In contrast, Rotwang's threatening pursuit of Maria, in which he stuns her with her flashlight, symbolically depicts the male enacting his revenge on the supposedly castrating female In contrast to Metropolis' serious and blatant illustrations of the male's fear of castration, the threat is dealt with far more light-heartedly and subtly in Der blaue Engel. While one could argue that the sexual objectification of Lola Lola ultimately exploits rather than empowers her, one cannot argue with the finality of the denouement, spotlighting the dead Rath whom she has truly vanquished. Her conquering, and thus castrating, him, is decided moments after he has entered the Blauer Engel. Literally turning the spotlight on him from the superior position of the stage, she simultaneously seduces him and discomforts him. Perhaps her most obvious parade of her phallic superiority is in her exhibition of her legs, constantly hugging them close to her, pulling stockings onto them and, in the scene where she drops her cigarettes and Rath rushes to pick them up, causing him to come literally face to face with them. A more subtle symptom of Rath's castration, however, is symbolised by his leaving his hat, a traditional piece of masculine attire and representation of the phallus, in her dressing room. Later, we see her donning a top hat, Rath's castration and her epitomising the modern concept of 'die neue Frau', who refused to conform to gender stereotypes in Weimar Germany, thus simultaneously completed. Not only Freud's concept of male castration fear, but also his interlinking theory of the Oedipus complex, features in Der blaue Engel. He experiences a gradual regression back to childhood, in contrast to Freder, who alternates between the role of regressor and that of mature mediator in Metropolis, portraying the latter at the end of the film. Furthermore, whereas Freder's view of Maria as mother is inevitably intertwined with the anti-Modernist, religiously allegorical idea of their being Jesus and Virgin Mary figures respectively, Rath's regression has an inverse relationship to Lola Lola's Modernist progression to stardom and sexual freedom. While Maria inherits the features of the modern Virgin Mary in order to facilitate the suppression of the female, once the robot has been destroyed, at Metropolis' conclusion, Lola Lola refashions the traditional idea of the German mother who is concerned only with 'Kinder' and 'Kuche'. As one critic has said, 'she wears the signs and insignia of a phallic mother'. Sadomasochistally infantilising him, a fact exemplified in the mise-en-scene in which he awakes next to a doll in her bed, she reduces him to the status of one of his pupils, one moment blowing face powder all over him, the next comforting him like a mocking mother. His Oedipus complex and subsequent downfall is hinted at in his teaching of Hamlet, the eponymous character of which, arguably, is consumed by his sexual feelings for his mother and dies as a result of his jealousy of his stepfather. Indeed, it is the recurrence of these pupils in Lola Lola's dressing room, particularly when they are hiding under the trap door, which represents his unsuccessful attempt to suppress his inner child who both desires the mother figure and fears his castration at her hands. Understandably, for Lola Lola takes the idea of 'die neue Frau' to the extreme, marrying him only to make him her servant, not only defying his wish that postcards of her should no longer be sold, for they encourage other men to possess her, but also making him sell them to these men at the Blauer Engel. Paul Coates, The Gorgon's Gaze: German Cinema, Expressionism and the Image of Horror (Cambridge, 991), p.1. Gertrud Koch, 'Between two worlds: von Sternberg's The Blue Angel ', trans. Jan-Christopher Horak, German Film and Literature: Adaptations and Transformations (New York and London, 986), ed. Eric Rentschler. If Der blaue Engel is modernist in the sense that it endeavours to destroy the hierarchy inherent in male-female relationships, offering a 'Reaction to stuffy, religiously and sexually repressive Wilhelminian era', then it is modernist also in its use of the star as a vehicle to destroy the stereotypical, cinematic depiction of 'men as patriarchal heroes' and 'women as mothers to the nation'. Clearly, Marlene Dietrich personifies the move away in German cinema from Expressionism to Modernism, according to one critic, she 'embodies a new acting style'. Although von Sternberg pays homage to certain aspects of German Expressionist Cinema, most notably in the 'looming and misshapen' Blauer Engel itself, resembling Rotwang's house in Metropolis, and in the recurring 'animal imagery' which sees Rath crow madly like a rooster at the film's ending, it is Dietrich's self-consciousness portrayal of her own stardom, profoundly contrasting to the 'melodramatic acting' of Expressionism, which contributes greatly to the Modernist nature of Der blaue Engel. As one critic has noted, modernist film reveals 'the voyeuristic position of the film spectator', and it is specifically this voyeurism on which Dietrich bases her cultivation of herself as a star and which is encouraged on several layers. The spectator views Rath and his pupils lusting over the postcards of Lola Lola and, simultaneously, finds himself or herself lusting over Dietrich the star. Fittingly, however, it is at the Blauer Engel that this cult of voyeurism reaches its climax. Rath tries to take his eyes off Lola Lola in her dressing room, but succumbs, like the spectator, to watching her undress. Ironically, the screen, which should hide her body while she changes, only draws both Rath and the spectator to glance at it all the more. As one critic has noted, Weimar, p. Erica Carter, introduction to The German Cinema Book (London, 002), p.1. Koch, 'Between two worlds', p.8. Childs, Modernism, p.26.

Blandford, The Film Studies Dictionary, p.5/86. Sternberg stages his interiors theatrically, continually creating narrowed perspectives, ones that establish relationships between characters in terms of beholder and object viewed: a screen behind which Lola changes clothes; a spiral staircase to her bedroom, good for theatrical entrances and exits, allowing Lola to seduce and simultaneously guide Unrat's glances; a tiny balcony for the chosen one, where Unrat can take in the show.Koch, 'Between two worlds', p.9. Just as Dietrich self-consciously creates the cult of the star in her portrayal of Lola Lola, Lang embraces the Modernist concept of 'technical display' throughout Metropolis. Indeed, the UFA studio, at that time the biggest in Europe, became a microcosm of the world during the film's production. For Lang's vision not only showcased the planes, trains and automobiles, in the scene depicting Metropolis the city, which had been relatively recently invented in the world outside the studio, but also used the film to showcase the technological progress made by his production team within the studio. The Schuefften process, which 'used a camera with two lenses focused two separate images onto a single strip of film', the -D effect produced by a swinging camera during the flood, momentarily deceiving the spectator into thinking they could be engulfed by water at any moment, just like Freder and Maria, and, according to Lang, the back projection created to enable Fredersen to communicate with Grot through a television screen, were all invented during the making of Metropolis. Malcolm Bradbury and James McFarlane, 'The Name and Nature of Modernism', Modernism, eds. Malcolm Bradbury and James McFarlane, p.6. Weimar, p.5/8. Jensen, The Cinema of Fritz Lang, p.8. Eisner, Fritz Lang, p.1. However, these revolutionary effects, despite their suggesting a Modernist tendency to 'technical display', are frequently used in Metropolis during scenes of an essentially Expressionist nature. Freder's second hallucination exemplifies one critic's definition of Expressionist cinema as involving 'melodramatic acting', 'a subjective experience of time' and 'a vividness or intensity of sensory perception'. His acting, as ever, is utterly melodramatic during this scene, illustrated throughout by his eyes, which are widened in terror, and at the conclusion of his vision, in which he punches an arm into the air to ward off Death's scythe. Yet the sheer 'vividness' of this vision and Freder's feeling that time has accelerated create an Expressionist mood which is enhanced, nonetheless, by the 'avant-garde editing figure the jump cut' during the false Maria's dance. Childs, Modernism, p.26. Gunning, The Films of Fritz Lang, p.2. Indeed, since this essay has attempted to emphasise the Modernist's concentration on mankind's technical progress, it would be useful, in the context of Metropolis, to view the Modernist movement as a hybrid form, constantly evolving and contradicting itself, as has already been suggested, unable to arrive at any fixed state. The ambiguity of Langian Modernism is reflected in the 'duality' of his characters, a duality which, in turn, is epitomised by the figure of Rotwang. In several ways, Rotwang is essentially a Modernist character. Like those who use their powers of invention to create ammunition only in order to destroy mankind, Rotwang's creation of the robot Maria may illustrate technological progression, but it highlights also, more importantly, the 'deathly magic in the creative impulse' which is magnetically drawn to the seemingly paradoxical dichotomy of creation and destruction. Conversely, as one critic has argued, 'the visual portrayal of his surroundings marks Rotwang as a medieval wizard, a trafficker in spirits and demons'. It is he 'whom Lang describes as the source of evil', and not Joh Fredersen, for whereas the latter desires the robot's creation in order to maintain the social hierarchy, the former uses the robot as a magical weapon against both the workers and Joh Fredersen. Clearly, then, the character of Rotwang espouses a contradictory 'gothic modernism'. For the robot is not only an invention of the Modernist, technological era, but also, in its ability only to obey Rotwang's orders, a creation inevitably intertwined to the ancient world of magic. Bradbury, Modernism, p.6. Gunning, The Films of Fritz Lang, p.5/8. Gunning, The Films of Fritz Lang, p.5/8. Gunning, The Films of Fritz Lang, p.7. If Modernist Cinema 'questions how it represents and what it represents', then an unquestionably Modernist feature of both Metropolis and Der blaue Engel is not the mere presence, but rather the significance, of sound in the films. Despite the developments during Metropolis' making of the Schuefftan process, jump cuts and inventive use of the swinging camera, technology had not yet made the sufficient progress needed to add dialogue to film. However, this apparent technological deficiency is counteracted not only by the film's soundtrack, but also in its clever use of illumination. As one critic concurs, 'Light can even create the impression of sound', and this is exemplified by the extreme whiteness of the air emitted by the whistles, synaesthetically suggesting to the spectator's eye their sheer volume. Likewise, the instances of apparently incidental sound in Der blaue Engel are remembered for what they attempt to represent. Thus, Rath's constant nose blowing is symptomatic of his desire literally to unblock his sexually repressive nature. His opening the window in the classroom at the beginning of the film lets in the joyous sound of female singing, thus, once again, confirming his desire to reawaken his sexual appetite. Conversely, his closing the window almost straightaway foreshadows his initial fear at the Blauer Engel of the sexual colossus who is Lola Lola, a fear which she herself will confirm when, dressing, she strikes a discordant note on the piano. Susan Hayward, Key Concepts in Cinema Studies (London and New York, 002), pp.27-28. Lotte H. Eisner, trans. Richard Greaves, The Haunted Screen: Expressionism in the German Cinema and the Influence of Max Reinhardt (London, 969), p.33. In conclusion, to a certain extent, neither Metropolis nor Der blaue Engel can be described as Modernist. Both films owe a debt to Expressionism in their use of distorted sets and chiaroscuro lighting; a considerable amount of Metropolis, evidently, was influenced by the movement, and this is apparent not only in its sets and lighting, but also in the melodramatic style of much of the actors, particularly Freder, and its depiction of subjective reality in the form of hallucination. On the whole, however, several elements of these films force us to define them as Modernist. The influence of modern thinkers such as Freud is apparent in both films' explorations of the psychoanalytic concepts of the Oedipus complex and castration fear. In turn, despite their identities as a silent film and an early 'Tonfilm' respectively, Metropolis and Der blaue Engel both exhibit an admirable desire to be as creative with sound as technology and their directors' imaginations allowed. Regarding individual merit, it is clear that Der blaue Engel's Modernism stems from its embracing of 'die neue Frau' idea and the self-conscious, interrelated cults of stardom and voyeurism. But it is in turning to Metropolis that the essential duality of Modernism is recognized. In superficial terms, its mere depiction of man's technological endeavours class it as Modernist. Probing deeper, however, it is in the representation of both positive and negative views of technology, as well as the parallel desire to enact social change in spite of the tyranny of the machine, and yet pessimistically accepting that social change is often superficial, which classifies Metropolis, as well as Der blaue Engel, as truly modernist.""","""Modernism in German cinema""","3834","""Modernism in German cinema emerged as a significant artistic movement that revolutionized the film industry both within Germany and worldwide. This avant-garde approach to filmmaking encompassed a diverse range of styles, themes, and techniques that challenged traditional cinematic norms and sought to push the boundaries of visual storytelling. From the chaotic backdrop of post-World War I Germany to the politically charged atmosphere of the Weimar era and beyond, modernist German cinema made a profound impact on the medium, influencing filmmakers across generations and continents.  The roots of modernism in German cinema can be traced back to the aftermath of World War I, which left the country in a state of turmoil and disillusionment. This period of social, political, and economic instability provided fertile ground for filmmakers to explore new ways of portraying the world around them. Directors such as Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau, and Robert Wiene embraced the tenets of modernism, rejecting traditional narrative structures in favor of fragmented storytelling, innovative editing techniques, and bold visual experimentation.  One of the most iconic films of this era is """"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"""" (1920), directed by Robert Wiene. This groundbreaking silent film is celebrated for its expressionistic visuals, featuring distorted sets, stark lighting, and angular shapes that reflect the psychological unease of the characters. """"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"""" exemplifies the modernist approach to storytelling, using visual language to convey emotions and ideas in a way that transcends traditional dialogue-driven narratives.  Another key figure in modernist German cinema is Fritz Lang, whose science fiction epic """"Metropolis"""" (1927) remains a landmark achievement in cinematic history. Combining futuristic visuals with social commentary, """"Metropolis"""" explores themes of class struggle and technological advancement, showcasing Lang's mastery of visual storytelling and innovative special effects that continue to influence filmmakers to this day.  The Weimar era of the 1920s and early 1930s marked a golden age of German cinema, characterized by a spirit of experimentation and creativity that produced some of the most enduring and influential films in history. Directors such as G.W. Pabst and Ernst Lubitsch emerged as leading figures in the movement, each bringing their unique vision to the screen and challenging audiences with provocative and thought-provoking narratives.  One of the most acclaimed films of this period is G.W. Pabst's """"Pandora's Box"""" (1929), starring the enigmatic Louise Brooks as the enigmatic and alluring femme fatale Lulu. Blending elements of melodrama, tragedy, and social critique, """"Pandora's Box"""" is a prime example of modernist German cinema, with its complex characters, moral ambiguity, and stark visual style that set it apart from conventional Hollywood fare.  The ascent of the Nazi regime in the early 1930s brought an end to the Weimar era and the flourishing of modernist German cinema. The strict censorship and ideological constraints imposed by the Nazis forced many filmmakers to flee the country or work under duress, leading to a dramatic shift in the cinematic landscape. Despite these challenges, some directors continued to resist Nazi control and produce films that subtly critiqued the regime through allegory and symbolism.  One such filmmaker was Fritz Lang, who left Germany in 1933 and went on to have a successful career in Hollywood. In his film """"Hangmen Also Die!"""" (1943), Lang drew on his experiences in Nazi Germany to craft a powerful anti-fascist narrative that condemned totalitarianism and celebrated the resilience of the human spirit in the face of oppression. This blend of political commentary and human drama exemplifies the enduring legacy of modernist German cinema, which continues to inspire filmmakers to explore complex themes and push the boundaries of visual storytelling.  In conclusion, modernism in German cinema represents a vital chapter in the history of film, marked by innovation, experimentation, and a bold rejection of cinematic conventions. From the expressionistic masterpieces of the silent era to the politically charged narratives of the Weimar era and beyond, modernist German filmmakers have left an indelible mark on the medium, influencing generations of artists and audiences around the world. By challenging the status quo and embracing the power of visual storytelling, these filmmakers have broadened the horizons of cinema and elevated it to an art form that transcends cultural boundaries and speaks to the universal human experience.""","885"
"6036","""Manydown is a 000 estate located west of Basingstoke around the village of Wootton St Lawrence in Hampshire. The estate is family owned and is a good example of diversification in agriculture, whereby 'not all eggs are in one basket' and income stems from a range of sources. Based on an integrated management and sustainable practices these sources include cropping, livestock production, farm property development and perhaps most crucially to Manydown's success, a farm shop which sells home produce - a vital link for the farm to the customer both locally and nationally. The farming system also includes conservation measures to address environmental issues.

URL Conservation headland strips, rotational hedging, wild bird strips, field margin management and beetle banks. Table: Manydown activities This largescale operation, as table suggests, requires a larger number of employees than a conventional farm - 2 full and four part time. Richard Sterling, Manydown's director suggested how there is a successful farm team at Manydown because there is a lot of flexibility amongst workers. This allows for multi-tasking to take place by staff and should help any problems with sickness within the workforce. The beef production unit is organised in such a way that the beef production manager lives next to the unit, meaning that he is involved 4/ with the unit and that the unit is always manned in the event of any problems such as calving issues occurring. Beef Production Beef production at Manydown is favoured as part of the livestock production due to its popularity within the farm shop but also because livestock farming suits the soil type on the farm. The soil, typically that of Hampshire, is a flinty clay loam over chalk meaning limited fertility creating higher costs and problems for large scale arable farming on the estate. Therefore the viability of many combinable crops is limited if the whole estate were to go into cropping. Much of the land is grade three and not the easiest to work, so beef production seems to offer an attractive alternative. Various considerations have to be taken into account when choosing a beef production system, as Baker summed up. Financial resources. These include cash flow requirements and the capital availability;physical resources, e.g. the area and quality of grassland available, field structure and the availability of water;date of birth of claves - autumn or spring;type of cattle - pure dairy, dual purpose or beef, or crosses.(Source: p 85/8 The Agricultural Notebook: Primrose McConnell 0 th edition, edited by R J Soffe 003) The 80 head beef herd is a key source of income for Manydown and is geared up for farm shop production. The farm shop, when set up in 994 was primarily set up for the sale of beef and this has now seen expansion to lamb, free range chickens and black pig bacon and sausages all produced on the farm. The homebred beef herd has seen major breed development over the past ten years with increased favour for Aberdeen Angus in order to meet customer preference. The original combination of Hereford Friesian cows crossed with Saler bulls has increasing seen Aberdeen Angus crosses to meet this demand. This is an innovative example of Manydown producing what is demanded, not just what it is necessarily easiest to produce and as the farm directly sells its own produce this is vital to successful business. It could be suggested that Aberdeen Angus are also used due to the breed's meat to fat ratio and growing rate. As a closed herd, meaning that no new stock is bought in from markets etc, Manydown has managed an organised system to provide a constant flow of produce through the shop throughout the year. In relation to beef, three cattle are slaughtered a week and at the other end of the scale, calving is spread out throughout spring, summer and autumn, in order to keep a steady flow of beef stock maturing and finishing throughout the year. Steers and heifers are killed at 00kg and 5/80kg respectively. The cattle system is geared to 8 months including both indoor housing and outdoor grazing. Winter housing occurs, as on most farms, due to unsuitable field conditions outdoors in the wet and so that the cattle do not loose condition and the ability to gain weight by using a greater degree of feed energy for temperature regulation. Summer grazing is based on 60 permanent pasture. Feed is a mixture of forage and concentrate with silage and cracker feed as well as milled rapeseed making up the majority of the diet. Following the increase in demand for Aberdeen Angus meat and the strive at Manydown for new ideas, a recent stem has been the creation of a pedigree beef herd was established in 000. Originally comprising of 7 cattle from successful Canadian bloodlines, the Knightingdale Angus cattle, Manydown has bred these animals with the idea of creating a centre point to their own commercial herd in future generations. The aim of this specialist smaller herd is for Manydown to breed its own bulls with this successful bloodline and become sufficient as unit for future meat production. The Manydown website states this aim and relates to the importance of knowing the whole production process when selling through the farm's own farm shop and obviously by controlling all aspects of the rearing process this is more so the case: 'We believe we are the only business who are able to control the process naturally from conception to consumption.' ( URL )In conclusion the beef unit is an important part of the estate. It was because of the beef that the farm shop was originally set up and since has seen great expansion. It appears in regard to livestock production as a whole that Manydown has an efficient organisation in that the company produces and markets home grown produce. This has proved very successful and built up a widescale cliental base, including through mail ordering. Much of the success from beef production and the farm shop as whole is related not only to quality, but also the confidence that a reputable farm shop gives the consumer - that is the produce has been home grown and hence that person does not mind paying a little bit extra for this. There is also the public perception that Manydown is a well managed estate and deliverers sustainable farming practices which promotes the companies success.""","""Sustainable agriculture and livestock production""","1423","""Sustainable agriculture and livestock production are essential practices in today's world characterized by increasing environmental concerns and a growing global population. These approaches aim to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. By integrating sustainability principles into farming practices, we can ensure the longevity of our food systems, protect the environment, preserve biodiversity, and promote the well-being of animals and farmers alike.  One of the key aspects of sustainable agriculture is soil health. Healthy soil is fundamental for productive farming as it provides nutrients, supports plant growth, and helps sequester carbon from the atmosphere. Practices such as crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and organic farming can improve soil health by enhancing its organic matter content, structure, and microbial diversity. Healthy soils are more resilient to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, making farms more sustainable in the long run.  Water management is another critical component of sustainable agriculture. With water scarcity becoming an increasing concern globally, efficient water use in farming is essential. Techniques like drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling can help farmers reduce water waste and ensure adequate supply for crops. By using water wisely, farmers can mitigate the impact of droughts and help conserve freshwater resources for future generations.  In livestock production, sustainable practices focus on animal welfare, resource efficiency, and reducing environmental impact. Improving animal welfare not only aligns with ethical considerations but also enhances productivity and product quality. Providing animals with adequate space, access to pasture, and a healthy diet not only ensures their well-being but also improves the quality of meat, milk, and eggs produced.  Resource efficiency plays a vital role in sustainable livestock production. Feed conversion rates, waste management, and energy use are key areas where efficiency gains can be made. Utilizing feed that is locally sourced, optimizing feed formulations, and reducing food waste can help minimize the environmental footprint of livestock operations. Proper manure management is essential to prevent nutrient runoff and water pollution, while energy-efficient practices can reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with production.  To reduce the environmental impact of livestock production, sustainable farmers may implement practices such as rotational grazing, agroforestry, and integrated crop-livestock systems. Rotational grazing allows animals to graze on pasture in a controlled manner, promoting soil health and biodiversity. Agroforestry systems combine trees and shrubs with livestock or crops, providing multiple benefits such as carbon sequestration, shade for animals, and biodiversity conservation. Integrated crop-livestock systems optimize resource use by recycling nutrients between crops and animals, reducing the need for external inputs.  In addition to on-farm practices, sustainable agriculture and livestock production also involve considering the social and economic aspects of farming. Fair labor practices, access to markets, and community engagement are essential for building a sustainable food system. Supporting local economies, promoting food security, and fostering rural development are crucial components of sustainable agriculture that benefit both producers and consumers.  Education and knowledge sharing play a vital role in promoting sustainable agriculture and livestock production. Farmers, policymakers, researchers, and consumers all have a role to play in advancing sustainable practices. Training programs, research initiatives, and policy incentives can help drive the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient food system.  In conclusion, sustainable agriculture and livestock production are crucial for ensuring food security, protecting the environment, and fostering economic development. By adopting practices that prioritize long-term sustainability, we can create a food system that is environmentally friendly, socially equitable, and economically viable. Embracing sustainable farming practices is not just a choice but a necessity in building a healthier and more sustainable future for all.""","724"
"62","""The ability to 'use our senses' relies on a number of sensory systems that enable detection, perception and cognition of environmental stimuli. Every sensory system has a specific way of responding to stimuli, yet the end result essentially remains the same: the generation of an action potential to stimulate nerve cells with a nerve impulse that will transfer this signal to the central nervous system. In this essay sensory transduction is illustrated by briefly explaining the different cell signalling mechanisms involved in the sensation of touch, heat, light, sound and smell, to allow for discussion of their similarities and differences.Sensory systems allow us to sense various stimuli constantly provided by the environment. This essay focuses mainly on the processes of sensory cells involved in the detection of these stimuli by specialised peripheral receptors, transduction along signalling pathways and encoding into a pattern of nerve impulses. Stimuli can be of mechanical, visual or chemical nature. Acoustic sensations as well as those of touch and heat rely on the activity of mechanoreceptors, which are mostly ion channels of some sort. In contrast to that, vision and olfaction are achieved by detection of photons and odourants, respectively, which act as ligands on receptors that are coupled to G proteins. The ultimate goal of generating a nerve impulse, to be perceived and interpreted by specialised areas of the central nervous system is the common task of all sensory cells, which otherwise are very distinct from one another on the structural level. All sensory systems function differently, yet there are a lot of similarities as well. It is difficult to establish comparisons on all aspects alike sheer due to the complexity and specificity of the cell signalling pathways involved, thus comparison has to be limited to some of the most obvious characteristics of sensory perception. Touch and Temperature going hand in handCutaneous touch and temperature perception are two senses that have quite a lot in common. Touch and temperature are detected by receptors, which are primarily found in specialised epidermal cells e.g. Merkel cells for touch or specialised nerve cells called nociceptors. As there is generally no ligand involved in touch perception or temperature perception, unless the skin is suspected to irritant chemicals or acid, the identification of mechanically sensitive receptors by ligand or toxin binding is not possible. Thus the detailed molecular compositions of mechanically activated proteins and the exact ways of activation remain unclear. But in either way, the response to touch or temperature does cause activation of mechanically gated ion channels and change of ion concentrations within the cell, which in turn cause the cellular membrane potential to change, therefore generating an action potential and ultimately resulting in a nerve impulse. The types of proteins most intimately involved in somatosensational processes belong to the transient receptor family. Up to now, 8 genes in six subfamilies have been classified as TRP channels in humans. These channels are largely non-selective and classified by their primary amino acid sequence or structure, which commonly entails a certain number of ankyrin repeats, five transmembrane helices and a membrane pore, rather than their properties or selectivity, due to their diversity. A model protein for TRP channels is the vanilloid receptor it is the only one so far that could be isolated and characterised on the basis of its ability to bind a ligand, in this case capsaicin, the molecule responsible for the hot taste of spicy food. Among many other nerve cells, TRPV1 is expressed in nociceptors of the skin, which appear to increase their cytosolic concentration of Ca + and Na+ ions in response to several stimuli. One is obviously capsaicin, which activates TRPV1 at a concentration as low as M, as well as substances with a pH below and temperatures above 0-2 C. Interestingly, the presence of one of these factors intensifies the response to another e.g. the reaction to heat is greater at lower pH, maybe because these conditions are associated with cell injury and infection. It is not certain how exactly touch in form of pressure or stretching can activate touch sensitive receptors. However, mutations of Caenorhabditis elegans elucidated that genes encoding microtubule subunits, membrane-associated structural proteins, and collagen are essential for touch sensitivity, thus this set of proteins could play a role in conveying force to a channel from each side of the membrane. On the other hand, activation by temperature might be attributed to conformational changes of the channel, since essentially all proteins are temperature sensitive. But there are several TRP channels with unusually high temperature sensitivity, which can be found preferably in pain and temperature sensing neurons of the skin. Besides TRPV1, TRPV2 is thought to be susceptible to noxious heat above 0 C while TRPV3 and are activated by temperatures from 2-0 C. Temperatures below 2 C on the other hand, activate TRPM8. There is little selectivity for ions, but especially Ca + permeability is markedly increased upon activation of these channels. Hearing by Hair CellsAnother sense that relies on mechanical transduction is hearing. The mechanisms involved in the detection of sound waves, however, are far better understood than the detection of other mechanical stimuli. And in contrast to the several different touch or temperature sensing cells with their vast number of receptors, only one type of specialised epidermal cells exists in the cochlea of the human ear, namely the hair cell. This is not to say that there are no other cells involved, but hair cells are the primary sensory cells with organelles that enable purely mechanical transduction. These organelles are stereocilia, tiny cylindrical, actin-filled rods of different lengths that emerge from the upper cellular surface in a hexagonal array. A sound wave entering the cochlea sets the stereocilia in motion, causing them to slide along one another and exert pressure on tip links, which are fine filaments connecting the stereocilia. Tip links are thought to be directly connected to Ca + ion channels, which will open or close, depending on the direction of the movement. Influx of Ca + ions causes opening of Ca + gated K+ ion channels and subsequently depolarisation of the membrane, thus the generation of an action potential. Changes in potential release a neurotransmitter from the basolateral surface of the cell to synapses connecting to the auditory nerve. The resulting postsynaptic signal leads to a nerve impulse, which is then transmitted to the brain. Rapid return to the resting potential is possible through K+ specific channels, which allow the ions to leave the cell. Hair cells that are tuned to higher frequencies express channels with smaller relaxation time constraints than cells tuned to lower frequencies, moreover, the number of K+ channels in a cell increases with the preferably detected frequency of this particular cell., Aside from being remarkably temporarily accurate and sensitive due to the lack of slow chemical processes and employing a direct mechanical approach for transduction, amplification of sound waves are another outstanding feature of auditory transduction. The proposed, and as of yet most likely, mechanism is thought to involve the hair bundle organelle. Unlike amplification of signals in visual transduction, which relies on the biochemical cascade taking place within rods or cones, it is the cell organelle itself that enhances vibrations caused by sound waves. And stereocilia may even vibrate in the absence of exterior stimuli, which seems as unlikely as the emission of photons by rods and cones, or the production of odourants by olfactory receptor cells. GPCRs unite light and smellContrary to that, phototransduction as well as olfaction are processes involving a relatively complex cell signalling pathway, which commences with a G protein coupled, to produce an active, GTP-bound form of G cGMP gated ion channels in the plasma membrane to close. Na+ and Ca2+ ions are prevented from entering the cell and the ROS are depleted of Ca2+ due to the continuous function of the plasma membrane Na+ -Ca2+/K+ exchanger. This causes a drastic reduction in the circulating current and activates the guanylate-cyclase-activating- catalyses synthesis of cGMP from GTP supplied be the guanine nucleotide cycle, which comprises guanylate nucleoside diphosphate kinase complex. So for the phototransduction process to go full circle, an additional step is needed. It is terminated by the dissociation of Rec from rhodopsin kinase, enabling the latter to phosphorylate activated rhodopsin as a prelude to arrestin binding. As arrestin binds to rhodopsin, the effect on G t is terminated. Finally, the release of all-trans-retinal enables opsin to engage in 1-cis-retinal binding and restoration of rhodopsin's original inactive ground state. ConclusionSensory systems are just as diverse as the multitude of stimuli they have to respond to, yet they share a common goal, that is translation of environmental sensations into signals that can be interpreted in the brain. The senses discussed are thought to have evolved divergently, yet certain common characteristics can be found, which indicates that these shared mechanisms are 'as good as it gets'. Membrane bound receptors are the primary cellular entities, detecting stimuli, and nerve impulses are the final outcome from all sensory cells. In all cases, ion concentration changes within the cells are essential for generation of an electrical signal. Calcium ions are the ones most widely used either as second messengers to control the action of certain to directly influence the cellular membrane potential, contributing of the action of sodium, potassium and sometimes chloride ions. Changes in intracellular ion concentrations are either induced directly by mechanically- or voltage-gated ion channels that function as receptors in the case of hearing or sensing of temperature, or require a whole range of biochemical processes. The proteins most commonly involved in cell signalling pathways are G protein coupled receptors, G proteins, adenylate or guanylate cyclases, phosphodiesterases, protein kinases and ultimately second messenger gated ion channels. All sensory systems have some kinds of adaptation and inhibition mechanisms to prevent overstimulation of the central nervous system, and these mechanisms are generally specifically tuned to the stimulus in question.

These systems are responsible for detecting various forms of energy such as light, sound, and chemicals, and converting them into electrical signals that can be processed by the brain. Signal transduction is the process by which these sensory signals are converted into a form that can be understood and acted upon by the body. In this comprehensive exploration, we will delve into the fascinating world of sensory systems and the complex mechanisms of signal transduction that underlie our perception of the world.  Let's start by understanding the fundamental concept of sensory systems. Our sensory organs, including the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin, are specialized structures designed to detect specific types of stimuli. For instance, the eyes are responsible for detecting light and colors, the ears for hearing sounds, the nose for detecting odors, the tongue for tasting flavors, and the skin for sensing touch, temperature, and pain. Each sensory system has specialized receptor cells that are sensitive to particular stimuli. These receptor cells convert the physical or chemical energy of the stimuli into electrical signals through a process known as transduction.  The process of transduction is essential for converting sensory stimuli into signals that can be interpreted by the nervous system. Let's take a closer look at how this process occurs in different sensory systems:  1. Vision: In the visual system, light enters the eye and is focused by the lens onto the retina at the back of the eye. The retina contains photoreceptor cells called rods and cones that are sensitive to light. When light strikes these cells, it triggers a cascade of biochemical reactions that result in the generation of electrical signals. These signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve for processing and interpretation.  2. Hearing: In the auditory system, sound waves enter the ear and are captured by the outer ear, amplified by the middle ear, and transmitted to the cochlea in the inner ear. The cochlea contains hair cells that are sensitive to sound vibrations. When these hair cells are stimulated by sound waves, they generate electrical signals that are relayed to the brain via the auditory nerve for perception.  3. Olfaction: The sense of smell, or olfaction, involves the detection of airborne molecules by olfactory receptor cells in the nasal cavity. These receptor cells contain specialized proteins that bind to specific odor molecules, initiating a series of biochemical reactions that result in the generation of electrical signals. These signals are then sent to the brain for processing and identification of different odors.  4. Taste: The sense of taste, or gustation, is mediated by taste buds located on the tongue and in the mouth. Taste buds contain receptor cells that are sensitive to five basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. When these receptor cells are activated by food molecules, they initiate signaling pathways that lead to the transmission of electrical signals to the brain for perception of taste.  5. Touch: The sense of touch is mediated by sensory receptors located in the skin that detect pressure, vibration, temperature, and pain. Different types of touch receptors, such as mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors, convert mechanical or thermal stimuli into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the spinal cord for processing and response.  In addition to the five traditional senses, the human body has other sensory systems that play important roles in perception. The vestibular system, located in the inner ear, helps us maintain balance and spatial orientation by detecting changes in head position and movement. The proprioceptive system involves receptors in muscles and joints that provide information about body position and movement. These sensory systems work together to give us a comprehensive understanding of our surroundings and enable us to interact with the world in a meaningful way.  Signal transduction is a vital process that occurs at the cellular level to convert sensory stimuli into electrical signals that can be transmitted through the nervous system. This process involves a series of molecular events that begin with the activation of receptor proteins on the surface of sensory cells. When a sensory stimulus binds to a receptor, it causes a conformational change in the receptor protein, leading to the activation of intracellular signaling pathways.  These signaling pathways involve the generation of second messengers, such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) or calcium ions, which amplify the initial signal and relay it to downstream effector molecules within the cell. This results in changes in cellular activity, such as the opening or closing of ion channels, the release of neurotransmitters, or the activation of gene expression. Ultimately, these molecular events culminate in the generation of an electrical signal that can be transmitted along nerve fibers to the brain for processing.  The process of signal transduction is highly specific and tightly regulated to ensure accurate and reliable transmission of sensory information. Different types of sensory stimuli trigger distinct signaling pathways tailored to the unique properties of each sensory modality. For example, light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the retina rely on a cascade of biochemical reactions involving the photopigment rhodopsin and the G-protein transducin to convert light into electrical signals. Similarly, olfactory receptor cells use a diverse family of odorant receptors to detect different types of odor molecules and initiate specific signaling cascades for each odorant.  Disruptions in signal transduction can lead to sensory impairments and disorders that affect perception and behavior. For instance, defects in the genes encoding photoreceptor proteins can result in vision disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa or color blindness. Dysfunction in the signaling pathways of taste buds may lead to taste disorders like ageusia or dysgeusia. Furthermore, abnormalities in the vestibular system can cause balance disorders and vertigo.  Understanding the mechanisms of signal transduction in sensory systems is not only essential for elucidating the physiological basis of sensory perception but also holds implications for the development of treatments for sensory disorders. Researchers are exploring novel approaches to modulate signaling pathways in sensory cells to restore normal sensory function in individuals with impaired vision, hearing, taste, or touch.  In conclusion, sensory systems and signal transduction are integral components of our perception and interaction with the world. These intricate processes allow us to detect and interpret a wide range of stimuli, from light and sound to taste and touch, enabling us to experience our environment in rich and meaningful ways. By unraveling the mechanisms of signal transduction in sensory systems, we gain valuable insights into the complex interplay between molecular events and sensory perception, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies to address sensory impairments and enhance human well-being.""","1321"
"389","""The first reports that microwave energy sources were suitable for accelerating organic synthesis reactions appeared in 986-, and the first reliable device for generating fixed microwave radiation was designed by Randall and Booth at the University of Birmingham during the Second World War. Initially the risks associated with the flammability of organic solvents and the lack of available systems for temperature control were a major concern. However safe microwave equipment is now available on the market which enables both accurate temperature and pressure control as well as the means to monitor reactions a a sealed reactor for 0 mins at 60 C in the microwave. This forms an intermediate after further heating at 60 C for 0 mins facilitates the cyclisation to forms the desired -aryl-H- addition of potassium carbonate, copper iodide and a ligand. The reported yields of similar reactions were approximately 5/8%1 however upon carrying out the reaction with yield obtained was a disappointing 2%. This may be due to the fact that different substrates were used and further work to optimise the microwave conditions could be carried out along with further comparisons with conventional heating in order to improve this yield. The poor yield could also be due to purification issues of the product which could also be optimised in order to improve the yield. The reaction time was decreased however, as using conventional heating the reaction could be up to several hours compared with 0 mins heating in the microwave. Usyatinsky A.Y.; Khmelnitsky Y.L.

However as mentioned before many other reactions have been reported as having faster reaction rates and higher yielding reactions due to microwave heating and these maybe be exploited successfully, thus decreasing reaction times of other organic syntheses. The reactions performed in the microwave may also produce less side reactions and so making purification of compounds easier.

This innovative technique harnesses the power of microwave radiation to accelerate chemical reactions, leading to improved yields, reduced reaction times, and enhanced selectivity compared to traditional methods.  The utilization of microwaves in organic synthesis has gained significant popularity due to its ability to overcome several limitations associated with conventional heating methods. By directly heating the reaction mixture, microwaves provide uniform and instantaneous heating, which promotes faster reactions and minimizes side products formation. This precise control over temperature allows chemists to perform reactions under milder conditions, reducing energy consumption and overall costs.  One of the key advantages of MAOS is its ability to facilitate reactions that are challenging or impossible under conventional conditions. By applying microwave irradiation, chemists can overcome activation energy barriers, leading to the synthesis of complex molecules in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods. This increased efficiency and productivity have made MAOS an invaluable tool for both academic research and industrial applications.  The speed of microwave-assisted reactions is perhaps one of its most defining features. Reactions that typically take hours or even days to complete can be achieved in a matter of minutes using microwave irradiation. This rapid turnaround time not only increases productivity but also enables chemists to explore a wider range of reaction conditions and parameters, accelerating the pace of discovery in organic synthesis.  In addition to speed and efficiency, MAOS offers improved product quality and purity. The controlled heating provided by microwave radiation reduces the formation of impurities and by-products, leading to higher yields and enhanced selectivity. These advantages are particularly beneficial in the pharmaceutical industry, where purity and efficiency are critical for the development of drug molecules.  Moreover, microwave-assisted organic synthesis is also environmentally friendly. The reduced reaction times and lower energy consumption contribute to overall sustainability, aligning with the principles of green chemistry. By minimizing the use of solvents and reagents, MAOS helps minimize waste generation, making it a more sustainable choice for chemical synthesis.  Despite its numerous benefits, it is essential to note that microwave-assisted organic synthesis requires careful optimization and understanding of the effects of microwave irradiation on different chemical reactions. Factors such as reaction vessel design, choice of solvents, and reaction parameters must be considered to maximize the efficiency and reproducibility of reactions conducted using this technique.  In conclusion, microwave-assisted organic synthesis represents a significant advancement in the field of chemistry, offering a faster, more efficient, and environmentally friendly approach to chemical reactions. By leveraging the power of microwave radiation, chemists can unlock new possibilities in organic synthesis, ultimately leading to the development of novel molecules with valuable applications in various industries.""","545"
"6059","""Tense is often viewed as a matter of time. It is used to describe time and therefore has the same qualities as time i.e. a past, a present and a future. In English, this expression of time is a property of a verb form. In this essay I will discuss the possibility that it is not as simple as this. Tense could in fact be a matter of syntax. It could be a grammatical feature that is independent of time. Syntax is 'the way in which words are arranged to show relationships of meaning ' (Crystal 997:4) I shall discuss whether it is possible to have a future time without a future tense. This will lead to discussion of how many tenses there are in English. There are three main approaches to tense in the English language: The traditional view, the functionalist view and the structuralist view. I will define and discuss each of these in turn. I shall first look at the relationship between tense and time. The scope of time cannot be covered by tense markings. For example, you cannot pinpoint where a pair of sentences such as the following would be on a timeline: We therefore cannot see tense as a relationship with time in this way. These examples may leave us asking 'when?' To give information about time we could say: In this case, the verb did gives the tense marking and the adjunct on Monday gives the information about time. This shows tense as a separate concept from time. It shows it as a grammatical marking, which could therefore be a matter of syntax. The first verb in the Verb carries the tense. This is, as Berk points out, 'a matter of form, not meaning' (Berk 999:00) I will now look at the three main approaches to tense. The traditional view comes from a Latin model. There is a past tense, a present tense and a future tense. Traditionalists see tense as having a very close relationship with time and as more of a temporal concept than a grammatical concept. However, English grammar does not support this view. Future time is not generally indicated in the verb form itself. The argument that the future is not a tense is based on grammar. Without auxiliaries, the future tense is the same as the present tense. Since future cannot be indicated by the first verb in a (present progressive) It can also be formed by will be/have or shall be/have plus the - ing form of the verb. It is also possible to form it from will/shall have plus a past participle. (will have past participle) Structuralists think that whereas the time expressed by these sentences may be future, the grammatical tense of the verb is either present or past. The tense of the sentence will affect how the sentence is formed, with relation to the Verb therefore the verb is formed with a past tense inflectional morpheme. As Carnie says 'Tense inflection on a verb is in complimentary distribution with auxiliaries' (Carnie 002:5/85/8). Either one of these can express the tense of the sentence. Tense is a matter of syntax when we see how the meaning of time relations can be changed with the changing of syntax. These examples illustrate that: This example shows how the rearranging of VPs in a sentence can affect the meaning. The meaning that is altered in this example is how the events are sequenced. In example 7. The pot is dropped before the apology is made. In example 8, the apolgy is made before the pot is dropped. By swapping the two VPs, the syntax is changed and therefore the timeline is altered. Some linguists argue that the structure of time-relations is deeper than this surface-level analysis. They are often called functionalists. The functionalist view is that tense is meaning-driven. Functionalists believe that tense is not just the grammatical state of the verb. It is related to peripheral concepts also. For example, Reichenbach, a logical semanticist, proposed that there are many tenses in English and to assess these three things must be taken into account, Speech Reference temporal ordering is also true of some passages containing many sentences. I have taken an example from a fictional book. past tense verbs do not have this obvious time line. When actions continue over a long period of time, the predicates are not ordered temporally, for example It is not only the order of the sentences that shows the temporal ordering of events. If a progressive or stative verb follows a past-tense verb, we assume that the progressive was occurring before the past-tense verb. For example: We assume that the window was open before I went over to it. The order of sentences is not necessarily the temporal order. This shows that word order is not the only thing affecting temporal-relations. Tense is definitely affected by context, and the context will affect the syntax used. For example 'Actor, 2, dies of heart attack' is written in present tense but when seen as a newspaper headline we assume that it means the event has already happened and is therefore in past time. The present tense can be used to express many different things. Berk summarises these. Habitual action can be expressed with the present tense, along with states, Universal truths, Planned future events, Commentaries, Performatives and Historical events. Comrie attempts to explain these uses of a one tense to express a different time than usual. For example present tense grammatically representing past time in narrative discourse. Comrie says: 'apparent exceptions to the use of a given tense as defined by its meaning can be accounted for in terms of the interaction of the meaning of that tense with independently justifiable syntactic rules of the language in question.' This implies that these differences are a matter of syntax, therefore making tense systems a matter of syntax. This all shows how the traditional view may not be as clear-cut as it first appears. As stated above, we have no future tense as such, but this does not mean we have no concept of future time. Tense and time can also be separated by looking to other languages for evidence. Chinese has no grammatical tense system but this does not mean that the speakers have no concept of time in their language. They have words to express past, present and future, and they understand time as well as any other speaker of a different language. Other languages such as Japanese mark tense on a different word class such as the adjective. In an Indian tribal language, Potowatomi, endings expressing time can be used on nouns. These are just examples of a different tense marking. The fact that they do not mark the verb for tense does not mean that they have no tense system. Their system of marking a different word in a sentence works just as well. Romance languages comply more with the traditional view of tense. On most verbs there are three markings for past, present and future time. Word order may change according to tense in some languages. The word order we use to convey a past event is different from that of other languages. British Sign language adds a time marker to the end of a sentence. For example, to say 'I ate' you would sign 'I eat' and then add the sign for 'finished.' In many pidgin languages, particles replace tenses as time markers. In some languages, the word order and grammar for each tense may be the same but the phonology may change. For example, in the West African tone-language, Bini, present tense is indicated by a low tone and past tense by a high or high-low tone. Other languages also show a difference of tense system from speech to writing. In French, the simple past tense does not occur in speech, only in writing. However, this does not mean that they can only convey this concept if they write it down. These are just some of the differences in tense marking across languages. It shows the variation in how time relations are conveyed. Syntax is just one of the factors affecting tense. In this essay, I have discussed the three main approaches to tense. Firstly, the slightly archaic traditionalist view that there are three the future tense is made up of combinations of these with auxiliaries. Finally, the functionalist view which is dominated by Reichenbach's theory of speech time, event time and reference time. These three make up several combinations to give the tense of a sentence. The functionalist view is concentrated on tense as a matter of syntax and sees tense as having a deeper structure than the surface grammar shows. It is all to do with where these three points are located in the sentence, which shows how they are related to each other in time. I have also discussed the weak relationship between tense and time. This has led to the discussion of other factors affecting tense and how tense in turn affects these factors. For example, how other languages cope with or without different tense systems but all maintain the same concept of time and how context affects how tense is used to convey a different time than expected (for example when the present tense is used to express a past event in narratives). The functionalist view seems to be the most widely accepted throughout the literature. It is generally agreed amongst linguists that tense and time have a weaker relationship than many people think. The structuralist view goes deeper into the structure of tense and suggests that it is not necessarily just grammar that creates tense, but syntax and meaning as well.""","""Tense in English grammar and syntax""","1914","""In English grammar, understanding and mastering the concept of tense is crucial for effective communication. Tense refers to the way verbs indicate time through their conjugation. It helps clarify when an action or state of being occurs, whether it is in the past, present, or future. By using the appropriate tense, speakers and writers can convey the timing of events accurately, enabling effective communication and clear understanding among participants. Tense not only influences the meaning of a sentence but also plays a significant role in indicating the relationship between different actions or events in a narrative. Let's delve deeper into the different tenses in English and how they are used.  1. **Present Tense**: The present tense is used to describe actions that are currently happening, habitual actions, general truths, or future plans. There are four main forms of the present tense: simple present, present continuous, present perfect, and present perfect continuous. For example:    - Simple Present: """"She sings beautifully.""""    - Present Continuous: """"They are playing football.""""    - Present Perfect: """"I have finished my work.""""    - Present Perfect Continuous: """"He has been studying for hours.""""  2. **Past Tense**: The past tense is used to describe actions that have already happened or were completed in the past. It indicates that the action occurred before the present moment. The past tense can be formed in various ways, such as simple past, past continuous, past perfect, and past perfect continuous. For example:    - Simple Past: """"He walked to the store yesterday.""""    - Past Continuous: """"They were studying when the power went out.""""    - Past Perfect: """"She had already left when I arrived.""""    - Past Perfect Continuous: """"I had been waiting for hours before they showed up.""""  3. **Future Tense**: The future tense is used to talk about actions or events that will happen in the future. It helps in expressing plans, predictions, promises, or assumptions about future occurrences. The future tense can be expressed using simple future, future continuous, future perfect, and future perfect continuous. For example:    - Simple Future: """"They will arrive tomorrow.""""    - Future Continuous: """"I will be working on the project all night.""""    - Future Perfect: """"By next year, he will have completed his degree.""""    - Future Perfect Continuous: """"They will have been waiting for hours by the time he arrives.""""  4. **Tense Consistency**: Maintaining consistency in the use of tense is vital for ensuring clarity and coherence in writing. Shifting between tenses without a clear rationale can confuse the reader and disrupt the flow of the text. Writers must choose a tense that suits the context of the sentence or paragraph and stick to that tense throughout unless there is a valid reason to switch.  5. **Sequence of Tenses**: In English, there are specific rules governing the sequence of tenses in complex sentences. For instance, when a main verb is in the past tense, the verbs in subordinate clauses are often in a past form, even if the action described in the subordinate clause actually takes place later than the main action. Understanding these rules is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences.  6. **Subjunctive Mood**: The subjunctive mood is a verb form used to express commands, wishes, hypothetical situations, recommendations, or suggestions. While the subjunctive mood may seem archaic in some contexts, it is still used in formal writing. For example:    - """"I recommend that she be promoted.""""    - """"It's essential that he attend the meeting.""""  7. **Modal Verbs**: Modal verbs play a unique role in expressing varying degrees of necessity, possibility, permission, ability, and obligation. Modal verbs such as can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would, and ought to are used to convey different shades of meaning in sentences. For example:    - """"You must attend the interview.""""    - """"She can speak two languages fluently.""""  8. **Aspect**: Apart from tense, verbs in English also have aspects such as simple, continuous, perfect, and perfect continuous. These aspects convey additional information about the nature of an action, whether it is ongoing, completed, repeated, or relevant at a particular point in time. Combining different aspects with tenses can provide detailed information about the timing and duration of actions.  In conclusion, mastering tense in English grammar is essential for effective communication. By understanding the nuances of different tenses, writers and speakers can convey their thoughts accurately and ensure that their message is clear and coherent. Practicing the use of various tenses in different contexts can help individuals become proficient in expressing themselves with precision and clarity. Tense is a fundamental aspect of language that shapes how we describe events, make plans, recount stories, and engage in everyday conversations.""","978"
"6027","""The aim of this report is to compare and contrast the three egg production systems in the UK. The systems are battery, free range and perchery/barn. Each system is different and will have advantages and disadvantages but the intensification of all three is the critical issue in this report. Factors such as productivity, efficiency, health, finance and many more, all need to be considered and this is what this report will also focus on. The battery systemThere are 0,00,00 chickens in this country and 5/8% are under the battery system. Battery consists of a shed with cages all along the sides of the walls and there are stacks. The cages hold to birds and the space for each is nearly an A4 piece of paper, this is the legal requirement. ' The average chicken will produce 38 eggs a year but that's with help from a 7 hour 'artificial sunrise and sunset's' to encourage egg laying. ( URL ). When a chicken lays an egg, an automatic system removes it from the cage. It is taken away on a conveyor belt and packaged. Finally, the birds stay in the cages for 2 weeks before they are slaughtered. The chickens tend to go into pies, pet food, soups, school meals, and even sold to restaurants. When buying these chickens to put into your sheds, the price for each bird will range from 0p to each. They will lack many feathers and have scars due to the confined space they are in. Their beaks are removed to stop them pecking the other birds and causing damage. DisadvantagesThe conditions are cramped, cosy but they are kept warm. The birds can not scratch around in the dirt, spread their wings, make nests, and they defiantly can not exercise properly. The wing span of the chickens is about 6cm, proving they can never spread them out. There cage is made up of wire mesh, to that the faeces can drop out of the bottom of the cage. Compared to free range systems which can live up to years of age and have freedom, these battery chickens are bored, angry and lifeless. 0 million male chicks per year are killed if they are too thin and they can not lay eggs. They will then be used for fertilisers and even food for animals. Diseases such as prolapses, cancer, bronchitis, and more can occur due to the conditions. There bones are so thin and brittle that they can easily break. They are packed in to a confined area, so overcrowding is inevitable. Over,00,00 chickens die a year from this system from diseases normally because the faeces is not removed. AdvantagesThe Battery system is used due to the mass production of chickens in a quick and easy way. Thousands are kept in sheds and killed within 2 weeks compared with the free range which live up to years old. They can be bought cheaply and therefore many farmers buy in bulk to keep costs down. Feeding them is easy, it is not very labour intensive but the end result is high productivity and this system is efficient. Mechanisation is used to provide food, water and the removal of faeces, which once again cuts costs. Predators will not be a threat to these chickens as they never go outdoors. This method of egg production by 012 will be swapped with the 'enriched' method. This system concentrates on animal welfare: the cages will be enlarged, heightened, each bird will have their own area for perching and a litter space must also be provided. There are mixed opinions of the battery system, whether to buy it because the meat is cheap or not buy it due to the conditions, welfare and entire concept of battery farming. The Free range systemThis system is very different and the opposite to the battery system because it encourages birds to be outside and also give them what they want. Consumers have realised what battery farming involves and the shift is moving to the buying of free range chicken. Even this trend is popular with retailers and restaurants now as consumers wish to know the meat is from a decent place and of good quality. Free range tries to create a natural environment with only 000 chickens to an acre. A good case study for free range is The Manydown Company near Basingstoke. They are fed a GM free diet and are free to roam and use their instincts. DisadvantagesThe birds are kept in huge flocks and naturally they would not be like this. So only a minority will actually scratch around and make nests. Also, like battery chickens they also have their beaks removed to prevent them bullying and pecking other chickens. Farmers need to get the balance right between keeping the process reasonable for consumers but at the same time the conditions and welfare for the chickens is as important. The threats of avian flu are remote but need to be considered says DEFRA. If it occurs then the chickens will need to be indoors which means the free range system will struggle. This system is ruled by EU regulations which are tight and in detail explain what free range production must have. The laws are strict but then the buyers can be sure that the quality is good and the chickens have had a decent life. Also, predators may be a problem as the chickens are outside. AdvantagesThe free range chickens live almost times more than the battery system and they are treated better. This means that compared with battery production, the consumers are satisfied more with free range. This system is productive because fewer birds will die because they are living in good conditions, meaning costs of removing the dead will be reduced. Building space is not needed as much because the birds are outside and only come in to roost. This will reduce costs for lights, heating and space. The chickens have freedom to graze, scratch and finally, their bones will be stronger than the battery chickens due to exercise. The Barn systemBarn production is when the hens are indoors but like the free range system they are free to be themselves. They also have a perch space of 5/8cm each and an area on metre squared will be for 5/8 hens. The floor has straw, shavings, sand and turf for them to scratch around in. A nest box will hold birds and the food and water are slightly raised so the food does not go all on the floor. Natural lighting is available and electric lighting may also be provided. AdvantagesThe barn system provides a varied environment from dust scratching to perches, so the chickens can get a feel of their natural behaviour. Unlike battery they can move freely around the house and strengthen their bone structure. Once again predators are not a problem as the chickens do not go outdoors. DisadvantagesLike the other two systems the beaks are removed or burnt to prevent the birds pecking others and causing damage. With all the birds on the floor area or in perches, controlling the faeces is extremely hard and can lead to the spread of diseases. The perches can be unsafe as birds fall between them and therefore injuries can be a problem. With all the birds mingling together parasites and other organisms can pass freely via the birds and spread throughout the house, causing more health problems. All these health problems will cost the farm money whether it be removing some chickens due to illness or treating them with products. This all costs money and time. Above is a table showing the barn and free range system and the comparison between capital costs and running costs. Naturally, the free range comes out to be higher with both costs. More effort, time, money and thought go into free range, whereas barn chickens are not treated as badly as battery chickens but they still require less attention than the free range. It is not surprising that free range costs are more because the diet and grass area need to be maintained at a good level in order to produce a good quality chicken and eggs. The table below shows all three systems and the percentage of what the consumers buy in the UK. Battery comes out top with about 0% but this can be justified because despite the horrific conditions these birds are kept in, some people in the UK can not afford to buy free range due to the price. Free range has about 0% bought which is not very surprising and then finally barn and organic follow. RecommendationThe free range system would be ideal due to the freedom and environment that the chickens experience. However, financially this is the most costly and requires many resources and time. Battery production is the opposite and requires very little as the chickens are inside caged up. In 012 this will be changed but all those farmers producing battery chickens will have to find alternative methods. Perhaps a compromise is the barn system. This system allows freedom and more of a natural environment; the one drawback is that they can not exercise outdoors. Maybe as only.% of the consumers in the UK buy barn eggs, as battery is being banned, the movement could go towards the barn system. Perhaps the barn production should be encouraged for the future and then eventually to a free range system which would be ideal for the chickens, buyers and even the farmers.""","""Egg production systems comparison UK""","1843","""When it comes to egg production systems in the UK, there are various methods employed, each with its own set of practices, benefits, and considerations. The two main systems widely used are the conventional cage system and the alternative systems like free-range, barn, and organic. Let's delve into the comparison of these egg production systems in the UK, considering factors such as hen welfare, egg quality, environmental impact, and consumer preferences.  The conventional cage system, historically the most common method in commercial egg production, involves housing hens in battery cages. These cages are typically small, often not providing enough space for hens to behave naturally. While this system allows for high stocking densities and efficient egg collection, it has faced criticism for compromising hen welfare. The lack of space to move freely and express natural behaviors can lead to stress and health issues in hens.  In response to concerns over animal welfare, alternative systems like free-range, barn, and organic have gained popularity. Free-range systems allow hens access to the outdoors during the day, providing opportunities for natural behaviors like dust bathing and foraging. This system is favored by consumers who prioritize hen welfare and prefer eggs from hens that have had access to outdoor areas. Free-range eggs are often perceived as being of higher quality due to the hens' varied diet and ability to exhibit natural behaviors.  The barn system, another alternative to conventional cages, houses hens in indoor barns with more space and environmental enrichments compared to battery cages. While hens in the barn system do not have access to outdoor areas, they can move freely within the barn, perch, dust bathe, and lay eggs in private nests. This system offers a balance between hen welfare and production efficiency, appealing to consumers looking for ethically produced eggs but at a lower price point than free-range or organic options.  Organic egg production is considered the gold standard in terms of hen welfare and environmental sustainability. Hens in organic systems are raised without routine use of antibiotics or synthetic pesticides, and their feed is required to be organic. Organic farms must adhere to strict animal welfare standards, including providing outdoor access and a more enriched environment for the hens. Organic eggs tend to command a premium price due to the higher costs associated with organic certification and production practices.  In terms of environmental impact, conventional cage systems typically have lower land usage and feed requirements compared to alternative systems like free-range or organic. However, they often raise concerns about waste management and pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations. On the other hand, free-range and organic systems may have higher land usage and feed requirements, but they are considered more sustainable due to their emphasis on pasture-based systems, biodiversity conservation, and reduced reliance on chemical inputs.  Consumer preferences play a significant role in shaping the egg production landscape in the UK. While some consumers prioritize affordability and may opt for eggs from conventional cage systems, an increasing number of consumers are willing to pay a premium for eggs from alternative systems that prioritize animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and quality. The rise of ethical consumerism and increased awareness of food production practices have driven the demand for eggs from free-range and organic systems.  In conclusion, the comparison of egg production systems in the UK reveals a complex interplay between hen welfare, egg quality, environmental impact, and consumer preferences. While conventional cage systems offer efficiency in production, alternative systems like free-range, barn, and organic prioritize animal welfare and sustainability. Ultimately, the choice of egg production system depends on a combination of factors including ethical considerations, production costs, market demand, and regulatory standards. As the industry continues to evolve, finding a balance between meeting consumer expectations and ensuring the well-being of hens will be key in shaping the future of egg production in the UK.""","748"
"28","""The major objectives of this laboratory were to develop an understanding of: Current, voltage, power and power factor in a simple electrical power systemMeasurement of torque and mechanical powerThe performance of a small three-phase induction motorA three-phase induction motor was connected to a a when it was at no a an electric current that repeatedly changes polarity from negative to positive and back again. The most commonly used form of alternating current does so in a sine wave pattern as shown in Fig.. Instead of current as a function of time it shows an alternating voltage, but an alternating current follows the exact trend as a sine wave. Alternating current motors are generally available as single phase or three phase motors. The currents produced are sinusoidal functions of time, all at the same frequency but with different phases. In a three-phase system the phases are spaced equally, separated from each other by 20. The three induction motor is used for high-power applications. This uses the phase differences between the three phases to create a rotating electromagnetic field in the motor. Through electromagnetic induction the rotating magnetic field induces current to flow in the copper conductors in the rotor, which in turn sets up a counterbalancing magnetic field and this causes the motor to turn in the direction the field is rotating. This type of motor is known as an induction motor. In order for it to operate it must always run slower than the frequency of the power supply feeding it causes the magnetic field in the motor to rotate, otherwise no counterbalancing field is produced in the rotor. AC motor speed primarily depends on the frequency of the AC supply and the amount of slip, or difference in rotation between the rotor and stator fields, determines the torque that the motor produces. Power alternating current power transmission, the power factor is the ratio of power to volt-amperes. In the simplest case, when the voltage and current are both sinusoidal, the power equal to the cosine of the phase angle between voltage and current. By definition, the power factor is a dimensionless number between - and. Instead of positive and negative values, the terms leading and lagging are used. When the load is resistive, the power delivered to it is equal to the product of volts and amperes, so the power factor is unity. When the load is inductive, such as in the induction motor used in this laboratory, the current lags the applied and powder brake probe Lem Heme 0 Amax, 00 mV/AConnecting leads, mm to mm with shrouded connectorsMethod:PreparationThe voltage, current, speed and power ratings of the motor are noted down. The measuring unit is set up as shown in the figures on page 1 of the laboratory handout. The measuring unit is switched on and the meter on the display is set to page, which shows 'V L1, L2, L3', showing the voltages on the lines that are connected. (D) is switched off and the variable output knob is turned off. The output voltage selector is set to three phase mode or. L1, L2, L3 and N are connected to the measuring unit. (B) switched on next and the variable output is turned to 5/8%. The values of the voltages are noted down from the display unit. The measurement display is turned back to page, and it is observed that the voltage displayed on this page is large since it is the average of the three voltage lines and the value is times the actual value. The line-to-line voltage is then increased till the display shows the rated motor voltage, 80 V. (D) is then switched off. The terminals L1, L2, L3 are connected to U1, V1, W1 respectively. (D) is switched on again. Torque and efficiency: MeasurementsAfter switching 00 A graph of efficiency against mechanical power is also pressing autoset. Another printout is taken out with the motor on full 00 as follows: The graph of torque against plotted. It is observed from the graph, that the speed of the motor is maximum at no-load. Hence, it decreases considerably with the increasing torque. Thus, torque and speed have a non-linear inverse relationship. The graph of efficiency against mechanical plotted. The graph shows that they have a non-linear relation and are directly proportional to each other till a certain value, after which the efficiency of the motor starts to fall. This value is the rated mechanical power value for the motor. Hence, the rated value is the point of maximum efficiency for the that the peak starting current of both instances equals Amps. But, the motor takes extremely long to reach the operating speed when it is on full takes a small amount of time when it is on no load (00 ms). CONCLUSIONThe aim of the experiment was to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of a three-phase induction motor. It also analysed the performance of the motor and measured its torque and mechanical power. As seen from the results and the graphs, the torque is inversely proportional to the speed of the motor. The efficiency, on the other hand, is directly proportional to the mechanical power. Also, the motor takes more time to reach the operating speed from start at full load as compared to no load.""","""Three-phase induction motor performance analysis""","1061","""When it comes to analyzing the performance of three-phase induction motors, there are several key factors to consider in order to understand how effectively the motor is operating. Three-phase induction motors are widely used in various industrial and commercial applications due to their reliability, efficiency, and simplicity. By evaluating different aspects of the motor's performance, engineers can ensure optimal operation, troubleshoot issues, and improve efficiency. Let's delve into the key parameters that are commonly analyzed when assessing the performance of a three-phase induction motor.  One of the fundamental parameters to evaluate is the motor's efficiency. Efficiency is a crucial indicator of how effectively the motor converts electrical energy into mechanical power. A higher efficiency implies that the motor is operating more effectively, resulting in lower energy consumption and reduced operating costs. Efficiency can be calculated by comparing the input electrical power to the output mechanical power. By monitoring efficiency over time, engineers can identify any energy wastage or degradation in performance, allowing them to take corrective actions to improve the motor's efficiency.  Another vital aspect of motor performance analysis is power factor. Power factor is a measure of how effectively the motor converts electrical power into useful work. A low power factor indicates that a significant portion of the electrical power is being wasted as reactive power, leading to inefficiencies in the system. Improving the power factor of the motor can help enhance overall system efficiency and reduce energy costs. Power factor correction techniques such as installing capacitors can help optimize the power factor of the motor and improve its performance.  Additionally, analyzing the motor's starting and running characteristics is essential for assessing its performance. The starting torque of the motor determines its ability to accelerate loads from a standstill position. A high starting torque is crucial for applications that require the motor to start under heavy loads. By conducting tests to measure the motor's starting torque, engineers can ensure that it meets the requirements of the application. Similarly, evaluating the motor's running characteristics, such as speed regulation and steady-state torque, helps in determining its stability and performance under varying load conditions.  Furthermore, vibration analysis is a valuable tool for assessing the mechanical condition of the motor. Excessive vibration can indicate issues such as misalignment, unbalanced rotor, or bearing wear, which can lead to premature failure of the motor. By monitoring vibration levels and conducting vibration analysis, engineers can detect potential problems early on and schedule maintenance to avoid costly downtime and repairs.  In addition to mechanical parameters, electrical measurements such as voltage, current, and frequency are crucial for evaluating the motor's performance. Deviations from standard electrical parameters can indicate issues such as overloading, voltage unbalance, or faulty components. Regularly monitoring electrical measurements can help identify potential problems and ensure the motor operates within safe operating limits.  In conclusion, analyzing the performance of a three-phase induction motor involves evaluating a range of parameters, including efficiency, power factor, starting and running characteristics, vibration levels, and electrical measurements. By comprehensively assessing these factors, engineers can ensure the motor operates efficiently, reliably, and safely. Regular performance analysis is essential for maximizing the motor's lifespan, reducing energy consumption, and optimizing overall system performance.""","621"
"411","""The right to silence; myth or reality? DiscussIntroductionTraditionally the right to silence has been known as one of the fundamental pillars of the legal system, working alongside the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof to protect suspects' rights within the criminal justice system. However reforms to the law have sought to alter this principle to the extent that the question has to be asked whether the right to silence still exists within the modern English legal system. To place the question within its context, I shall briefly explain what the right to silence is; its origins and history and its place within the legal system. This essay shall have two primary objectives; firstly to engage with the right to silence debate, analysing some of the better known theories and questioning whether there should be a right to silence. Secondly, examining the current legislation and case law and discovering whether the right to silence currently exists within the modern English legal system. In order to answer this I shall begin by examining the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 984 and the subsequent case law upon the practice of law. I have also conducted interviews with both a police officer and a criminal solicitor and hope to use this evidence to provide an insight into the practical use of the right to silence within the trial process. In doing so I hope to analyse its impact both pre-trial and within court and discover whether the right to silence still remains albeit in a modern altered form, or whether it has been removed through reform and merely exists in name only, as a shadow of its former self. With particular emphasis on the cases from the European Court of Human Rights. Interview with John Cardiff, a current prosecutor for Warwickshire CPS Interview with David Coyle, a current defence solicitor for Sarginson Hughes & Masser What is the right to silence? 'nemo tenetur seipsum accusare' 'No man is bound to accuse himself' The right to silence is embedded within the foundations of the legal system that a suspect has the right not to answer any questions if they so wish and that no adverse inferences shall be drawn against them. The authority for the principle was stated by Lord Parker CJ '.though every citizen has a moral duty, or if you like a social duty to assist the police, there is no legal duty to that effect. The whole basis of the common law is that right of the individual not to answer questions put to him by a person of authority.' Rice v Connolly All QB 14 The principle of is one of fundamental importance to the adversarial criminal justice system, that it is the prosecutions duty to satisfy the burden of proof, so much so that Lord Sankey LC declared 'no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.' This is an argument that has been strongly argued by Dennis, that the burden of proof is entwined with the presumption of innocence that every person charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. Woolmington v DPP AC 62 C&P 5/8 I.Dennis 'Reverse onuses and the Presumption of Innocence: In search of principle' Crim LR Article. European Convention on Human Rights It should be remembered that the right to silence is perhaps better interpreted as the 'privilege against self-incrimination' as it is the freedom not to divulge incriminating information, resulting in no adverse consequences that is so fundamental to the right to silence, rather than simply the act of silence itself. Greer, 990; Easton, 991 taken from Home Office Research Study 99, The right of silence: the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994 by Tom Bucke, Robert Street and David Brown Home Office Research Study 99, The right of silence: the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994 by Tom Bucke, Robert Street and David Brown It would be misleading to suggest that the right to silence has always been absolute as this has not been case. Lord Atkinson stated that the jury may interpret an 'acceptance 'of the allegation through a suspects silence and Lord Parker CJ stated that that a judge may remind a jury of a defendant's failure to give a statement or allow cross-examination. It should also be remembered that there is nothing to prevent a magistrate or jury from treating silence as guilt regardless of directions from the judge. However in principle the right to silence remained intact until the creation of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994, forming the basis of the current law, arguably destroying the right to silence and eroding the principle of the presumption of innocence. Christie AC 45/8 Bathurst QB 07 The Royal Commission on Criminal Criminal Law revision Committee, Eleventh Report: Commission on Criminal Procedure, of the Working Group on the Right to Silence Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, known as the Runciman Commission As mentioned earlier, the very basis of the right to silence is that it is a basic constitutional right of the individual not to have to answer questions and for no adverse inferences to be drawn through their refusal. It is the principle that the right to silence is intrinsically entwined within the principles of the burden of proof and presumption of innocence and that an attack on the right to silence represents an attack upon the most basic principles of justice of the criminal justice system. However beyond this basic constitutional right, there are four topics of contention regarding the right to silence. Rice v Connolly All QB 14 Silence as Guilt The philosophy behind the abolition of the right to silence is based upon the presumption that silence is evidence is of guilt. Bentham who provided the basis for this philosophy described it as 'innocence claims the right of speaking, as guilt invokes the privilege of silence'. In simple terms this is the basic philosophy that only the guilty have anything to hide and thus the right to silence is merely a protection for the guilty. J. Bentham, Treatise on Evidence, p 41. Taken from Greer, Stephen: The Right to Silence: A Review of the Current Debate, The Modern Law Review, Vol. 3, No.. (Nov., 990), pp. 09-30. An argument supported by the 987 Home Secretary. Mr Douglas Hurd who asked the rhetorical question: 'does the present law really protect the innocent whose interests will generally lie in answering police questions frankly?' M. Zander, Cases and Materials on the English Legal 47. Taken from Greer, Stephen: The Right to Silence: A Review of the Current Debate, The Modern Law Review, Vol. 3, No.. (Nov., 990), pp. 09-30. The widely held view is that this is not the case and that there are numerous possible factors which may result in a suspects silence at interview such as 'fear, anxiety, confusion, the desire to protect someone else, embarrassment, outrage or anger.' As such it would be wrong to assume that all silence is a reflection of guilt, when any of the above emotions, reflected through silence, may be a rational response within the circumstances. Furthermore creating a situation where it is a disadvantage to a suspect's case to remain silent creates a pressure to speak, regardless of innocence or guilt, creating the potential for a suspect to incriminate himself and increasing the probability of creating unreliable evidence.

Taken from Choo, Andrew L-T: Evidence, Oxford University Press, First Edition, 006, P68 McConville, Mike and Hodgson, Jacqueline: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: Custodial Legal Advice and the Right to Silence, Research Study No.6, 993 Criminal ProcessIt has been argued that when a suspect exercises their right to silence they hamper the investigation of the police. Regardless of whether this is true, it is argued that it this should not even be considered, as is not within the nature of the adversarial criminal process for a suspect to aid the investigative procedure. In the trial of Dr Bodkin Adams, Devlin J explained this succinctly and poetically in his summing up to the jury: In light of the earlier discussion regarding ambush defences I would suggest that it is not. 'The law on this matter reflects the natural thought of England. So great is and always has been our horror at the idea that a man might be questioned, forced to speak and perhaps condemn himself out of his own mouth that we grant everyone suspected or accused of crime at the beginning, at every stage and until the very end to say: 'Ask me no questions. I shall answer none. Prove your case'.' Patrick Devlin, Easing the designed ot be helpful to the prosecution, and more generally to the system, But it is not the job of the defendant to be helpful to either the prosecution or to the system. His task, if he chooses to put the prosecution to proof is simply to defend himself.' Ambush Defences The most quoted argument condemning the right to silence is that it creates an incentive to mount ambush defences. There is much academic debate as to what extent ambush defences are used within the criminal process, partly due to the wide ranging differences in definition of an 'ambush defence'. The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice defined it as having the following features; raising a defence for the first time in court, to which the prosecution have had no notice, taking the prosecution by surprise and depriving them of the opportunity to investigate and refute the defence. I have discussed the morality of such defences in my analysis of the criminal process, however regardless of morality there remains great division as to the impact of ambush defences. The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice found that ambush defences were raised only in the minority of cases, and even then most ended in conviction. Studies have estimated the use of ambush defences as high as -0% or even as low as.-%. During his study Leng found that often unanticipated defences created a greater problem for the prosecution, perhaps due to the nature of the adversarial system and as a result of poor police interrogation technique, rather than an attempt to withhold evidence. As such it appears illogical that ambush defences are accused of causing such a significant problem within the criminal justice system. Furthermore it has been suggested that the problem of ambush defences had been exaggerated simply to secure the passage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. Leng, Roger: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: The Right to Silence in police Interrogation: A study of some of the Issues Underlying the Debate, Research Study No.0, 993 Zander and Henderson's Crown Court study taken from Home Office Research Study 99, The right of silence: The impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994 by Tom Bucke, Robert Street and David Brown Leng, Roger: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: The Right to Silence in police Interrogation: A study of some of the Issues Underlying the Debate, Research Study No.0, 993 Home Office Research Study 99, The right of silence: The impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994 byTom Bucke, Robert Street and David Brown In addition it has been argued that the implementation of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 996 has further reduced the danger of ambush defences. The Act requires that in certain circumstances, following disclosure from the prosecution, the defence be required to set out the nature of the accussed's defence and failure to do so may result in inferences being drawn. The significance of this legislation is that it allows a retention of the right to silence, only forcing the suspect to comment once they have been made aware of the prosecution case against them. s. Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 996 s. 1 Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 996 Convictions Finally there remains the issue of convictions, which can be separated into two interesting questions, firstly whether an erosion of the right to silence will lead to further convictions and secondly even if it does whether this is an appropriate reason to abolish the right. There is an assumption that the removal of the right to silence shall automatically result in an increase in convictions; however there appears to be little evidence to support this claim. Results have varied when estimating how often silence is used within interviews, prior to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994; estimates were between % and 2%. Research has shown since the implementation of the Act that there has been a reduction in the use of the right to silence, this is a view shared by a current defence solicitor who claims that the right is rarely used at all, if ever. It has been suggested that rather than providing further reliable evidence conducive to aiding an investigation, there is a tendency for suspects to create falsified unreliable evidence instead. Leng, Roger: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: The Right to Silence in police Interrogation: A study of some of the Issues Underlying the Debate, Research Study No.0, 993 Association of Chief Police from Home Office Research Study 99, The right of silence: the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994, byTom Bucke, Robert Street and David Brown Interview with David Coyle, a current defence solicitor for Sarginson Hughes & Masser ibid With regard to the investigative nature of the right to silence, the RCCJ discovered that often a detainee's denial is more effective in impeding a police investigation than the right to silence. In only % of the cases where the police tried to break down a negative response did they succeed. Leng, Roger: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: The Right to Silence in police Interrogation: A study of some of the Issues Underlying the Debate, Research Study No.0, 993 Research surrounding the impact of CJPOA has actually demonstrated a reduction in the number of suspects charged, demonstrating that although fewer suspects are able to exercise their right to silence, it is not resulting in an increase charges, again questioning the theories supporting the abolition of the right to silence. Table. Case outcome by exercise of the right of silence taken from Bucke, Street and Brown: The right of silence: The impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994, Home Office Research Study 99 P41 Finally there remains the question of even if the CJPOA does increase convictions, whether this is an appropriate reason to abolish to right to silence. Removing the right to silence to increase convictions is an argument based within the Crime Control position; a position assumed by the Runciman Commission that 'convicting the guilty is of equal importance to acquitting the innocent.' However this can surely not remain the case when doing so involves the elimination of a fundamental principle of justice. It could be argued that it would be possible to increase convictions through the removal of the right to legal advice; however this would not even be considered as it is a fundamental principle of justice. I see no difference with the removal of the right to silence. The effect of convictions should almost be considered irrelevant, as it is not a matter of how many convictions, but how many safe convictions and if the removal of the right to silence will in any way further the chances of innocent people being convicted then it should not even be considered. Packer, The Limits of The Criminal Sanction, Oxford University Press, 969 The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice: A Confidence Trick? Young and Sanders, Oxford University Press 994 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies Val 4, No Having examined the arguments for and against the right to silence, there appears to be no sufficiently justifiable reason for the abolition of the right. The use of silence as evidence of guilt has been shown to be an antiquated fallacy and the use of ambush defences has been shown to be in a minority of cases which have little impact of the outcome of the investigation. Furthermore the overriding belief that drawing inferences will lead to further convictions has also been shown to be an inaccurate assumption, neglecting the moral consequences of the right. Thus with the theories supporting the abolition of the right to silence being demonstrated as fundamentally flawed, there is no justification for overturning the principles of justice of the presumption of innocence and the constitutional values of the criminal process. Does the right to silence exist? Having concluded that the right to silence is a fundamental protection within the criminal process, the question remains whether the right to silence still exists and if so in what capacity, following the implementation of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994. I shall examine this question through an analysis of s.4 of the Act and the resulting case law and the European Court of Human Rights to discover its impact upon right to silence. Criminal Justice & Public Order Act s.4The provisions of the Act state that a suspects failure to mention facts when questioned or charged and reliance upon those facts, (a fact being something that the defendant could reasonably have been expected to mention) the court may draw such inferences as appear proper. In order to examine to what extent there has been an erosion of the right to silence, it ought to be considered when an inference may be drawn and to what effect. The first requirement for an adverse inference to be drawn under s.4 is that the fact relied upon is one which the suspect 'could reasonably have been expected to mention'. Although this appears straightforward it creates ambiguities as to when it is deemed 'reasonable' to mention a fact. In doing so the jury are expected to consider whether the fact in question was known at the time of interview and whether its significance was appreciated. If there is no proof that this was the case it would be unconscionable to direct a jury to consider drawing an adverse inference. Such is the complexity of a decision that it is been argued that it is beyond the competence and constitutional role of the jury. Analysing it in practical terms the direction to the jury in the case of Argent included such a list of possibilities for the jury to consider that it is near impossible to decide what circumstances could justify silence.

(MT) Crim LR 81 taken from Leng, Roger: Silence pre-trial, reasonable expectations and the normative distortion of fact finding E&P Leng, Roger: Silence pre-trial, reasonable expectations and the normative distortion of fact finding E&P Argent Cr App R 7, CA Secondly there is the question of what constitutes a 'fact' and whether it was relied upon within the suspects defence. He definition of a fact has been given a wide discretion, in Milford Potter LJ suggested that a fact is a 'particular truth known by actual observation or authentic testimony, as opposed to what is merely inferred, or to a conjecture or to fiction.'Thus in rather complicated definition a fact is not simply a matter of what has happened and yet is not a speculative explanation or an allegation but is an asserted fact or explanation for ones behaviour. Milford Crim LR 30 Nickolson Crim LR 81 LR 81 In keeping with the wide definition of a fact, there is similarly a wide interpretation of when it has been relied upon. In Webber it was held that a defendant relies on a fact when counsel puts an argument to a witness, even if that witness rejects the argument being put forward. Thus proving a difficult test to overcome. However there is some leniency in the fact that if a defendant refuses to respond to evidence at all, then no adverse inferences can be drawn against him. If this weren't the case then it would constitute a flagrant breach of Article right to silence, the same is true of a bare admission of the prosecution case. R v Webber WLR 04 The European Court of Human RightsThe right to silence is not specifically incorporated within the ECHR; however it was believed to be implicitly contained within the Article right to a fair trial. The ECHR was first asked to consider the compatibility of drawing adverse inferences from pre-trial silence with Article in the case of Murray v UK. In summary it was decided that a court may take into account a defendants pre-trial silence provided there is a balance between the exercise of the right to silence and the circumstances in which an adverse inference may be drawn. Following this case there was some speculation that this was only applicable in a diplock trial and that the court may take a different approach in a jury trial. This was considered in the case of Condron where the court decided that although the direction from the judge was inadequate, but that if the direction had been right, there is no reason why a jury would not have been capable of deciding upon the case. Therefore virtually eliminating the possibility that the CJPOA will be declared incompatible with the convention. In essence this effectively leaves the right to silence in difficult position. Right to a fair trial Murray v UK 2 EHRR 9 The case of Murray involved the Criminal 998 and was thus related to a Diplock trial; trial by judge with no jury Condron v UK Crim LR 79 The Effect of s.4 Having examined s.4 it can undoubtedly be seen that the Act has created a severe erosion of the right to silence. The Act has left limited circumstances in which it is acceptable to remain silent; creating a strict interpretation of what constitutes a fact and a wide interpretation as to when a fact is relied upon. The ECHR has examined the right to silence, declaring it a 'qualified or restricted right' and holding the CJPOA to be compatible with Article as long as the judge directs the jury to only draw adverse inferences if satisfied the suspects silence could only be attributed to their having no answer. It is suggested that although s.4 does not create a legal duty to speak, it shall undoubtedly place further pressure upon a suspect to speak, arguably creating an 'inchoate norm' to that effect. The impact of the Act upon convictions isn't yet known, however Leng argues that such is the undeniably complex nature of silence and the reasons behind it, within a proper interpretation of the law inferences should very rarely be drawn. Furthermore when inferences are drawn it should be questioned whether juries have done so for the correct reasons. The term 'inchoate norm' is used here to describe a norm which is widely accepted although uncertain in scope, which is subject to no formal sanction for breach, but for which breach is routinely subjected to an informal and indirect sanction. Paragraph paraphrased from Leng, Roger: Silence pre-trial, reasonable expectations and the normative distortion of fact finding E&P Looking to the future it has already been suggested that the legislation be repealed on a cost-benefit basis and it has even been suggested by Hedley J that prosecutors should be discouraged from using the Act for fear of '. further complicating trials and summing-up by invoking this statute unless the merits of the individual case require that his should be done.' The endorsement of the Act by the ECHR and the long struggle for its inclusion has rendered it unlikely that the act will be repealed. When drawing conclusions as to whether the right to silence still exists, it is clear to see that in technical terms the right still has effectively been removed by the CJPOA, however due to its complex nature is difficult to put into practice. 'The choice will be between tinkering with section 4 so as to reduce its impact, or giving up the ghost and reverting to the common law rule. It is hoped that this survey of the existing law has gone some way to convincing readers that there is nothing significant to be lost, and much to be gained, were we to adopt the latter course.' D. Birch, 'Suffering in Silence: a Cost-Benefit Analysis of Section 4 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994' Crim LR 69, 88. Taken from Cooper, Simon: Legal advice and pre-trial silence-unreasonable Developments, International Journal of Evidence and Proof, 006, P2 Hedley J in Crim 10 at taken from Munday, Roderick: Evidence, Oxford University Press, Third Edition, 005/8, P5/834 Conclusion In examining the right to silence the evidence is strongly in favour of retaining the right to silence. The arguments of silence as guilt, ambush defences and the need to secure convictions are counter balanced and surpassed by the principals' constitutional and moral legitimacy. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that the right in practice has little effect on the prosecutions investigative abilities and its impact exaggerated. Overall demonstrating there is insufficient evidence to justify its abolition. In questioning whether the right still exists, the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994 has left the right to silence as a shadow of its former self. Technically suspects are still privileged with the right to remain silent, there is no legal duty to answer questions, although in reality this now means very little. A suspect exercising their right to remain silent during interview and in court will be subject to the court drawing inferences as to the subjects guilt and thus eliminating the very protection the right to silence is intended provide. Even the European Court of Human Rights appears to have turned its back on the right to silence. Thus it can be seen the future of the right to silence looks bleak. Contemporary society is moving towards a model of crime control, with the protections of presumption of innocence and burden of proof increasingly being eroded. Previous legislation such as the Criminal, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994 and more recently the Terrorist Acts all reflect this trend. It is ironic that in these times of political instability that the safeguards of due process are needed the most. This includes the right to silence, as argued by Greer 'The right to silence should not merely remain a vital part of the criminal justice system of England and Wales; it should be strengthened'. Unfortunately in the current political climate, this is unlikely to happen. Packer, The Limits of The Criminal Sanction, Oxford University Press, 969 Terrorism Act 000, Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 001, The Prevention of Terrorism Act 005/8 and Terrorism Act 006 Steven Greer, The Right to Silence: A Review of the Current Debate, The Modern Law Review 3: November -961 Research MemorandumI have chosen to write my essay on the right to silence as I have found it one of the most engaging and curious topics throughout the module. Prior to having studied the topic, it was my understanding that the traditional interpretation of the right to silence remained intact, however in reality it seems that this is far from the truth. In my opinion this seems to be an exorbitant erosion of one of the fundamental principles and protections of English law and thus this is my motivation for choosing it as the topic for my essay. The exact title of the essay arises from the fact that my opinion on the merits of the right to silence are very straightforward, that I believe in its importance and merits within the legal system. As such the essay title and thus essay, focuses both on whether the right to silence should exist and significantly whether it still does within the modern legal system. The starting point of my research was as always my lecture notes and textbook. Traditionally this is often the point from which I begin an essay as it gives me the basic areas with which to cover and points me in the direction of further areas of study. My second point of research is along the same lines, that I like to consult another textbook, simply to consolidate my earlier research and again to point me in the direction of further ideas. For this purpose I looked at Roberts and Zuckerman's Criminal Evidence as it's a book I've consulted previously during ALS and other modules and is very good analytical text. Choo, Andrew L-T: Evidence, Oxford University Press, First Edition, 006. P67-5/8 Roberts and Zuckerman, Criminal Evidence, Oxford University Press, First Edition, 004 From here my research switches primarily to journal articles. I found these online through Westlaw and Lexis Nexis and used these to provide more specific research on the right to silence debate and the impact of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 994. I also used Westlaw and Lexis Nexis to find the relevant cases and legislation. Finally I conducted two interviews; firstly with a local defence solicitor who works for and secondly with a prosecutor from the Warwickshire CPS. I chose to leave the interviews until last as I wanted to be certain of my subject material and specific questions I could ask, rather than simply asking general questions which would be of little benefit. I conducted the interviews by telephone and created a list of questions I wanted answering prior to calling. I asked questions as to the use and implementation of the right to silence and I specifically asked whether they were in favour of the right to silence and whether they believed it still existed.""","""Right to silence in law""","5915","""The right to silence in law is a fundamental principle that ensures individuals have the right to remain silent during police questioning and not be compelled to incriminate themselves. It is a cornerstone of a fair and just legal system that safeguards an individual's rights and prevents coercion or abuse of power by authorities. This concept is enshrined in legal systems around the world as a crucial protection for the accused, emphasizing the presumption of innocence until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  The right to silence is deeply rooted in the notion of individual autonomy and dignity, affirming that no one should be forced to provide self-incriminating evidence. This principle aligns with the broader principles of due process and the right to a fair trial, serving to level the playing field between the state and the individual. By allowing individuals to choose whether to speak or remain silent when questioned by law enforcement, the right to silence promotes accountability and transparency in legal proceedings.  One of the key benefits of the right to silence is that it prevents coerced confessions or false admissions. In the absence of this protection, individuals may feel pressured to provide incriminating statements, whether true or false, out of fear, intimidation, or confusion. By allowing individuals to control the narrative of their interaction with the legal system, the right to silence helps prevent miscarriages of justice and wrongful convictions.  Moreover, the right to silence contributes to the overall integrity of the criminal justice system. By respecting an individual's decision not to self-incriminate, the legal system upholds the principle of fairness and discourages abusive interrogation tactics. This, in turn, promotes trust in the legal system and ensures that justice is served based on reliable and credible evidence.  In practice, the right to silence empowers individuals to make informed choices about their participation in legal proceedings. When faced with questioning by law enforcement, individuals have the right to consult with legal counsel and consider the potential consequences of their statements. This right encourages individuals to exercise caution and seek legal guidance to protect their interests and ensure that their rights are upheld throughout the legal process.  It is important to note that the right to silence is not absolute and may be subject to limitations in certain circumstances. For example, in some jurisdictions, there are legal requirements to identify oneself when lawfully detained by authorities. Additionally, failure to provide certain information when required by law, such as providing a driver's license during a traffic stop, may lead to legal consequences.  Despite these limitations, the core principle of the right to silence remains paramount in upholding individual rights and ensuring a fair legal process. The right to remain silent serves as a shield against self-incrimination and coercive tactics, ensuring that individuals are treated with dignity and respect throughout legal proceedings.  From a global perspective, the right to silence is recognized as a fundamental human right essential for the protection of individual liberties and the preservation of justice. International human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, affirm the right to remain silent as a fundamental protection against arbitrary state power and injustice.  In conclusion, the right to silence in law is a vital safeguard that upholds the principles of fairness, justice, and human dignity in legal systems worldwide. By allowing individuals to choose whether to speak or remain silent during legal proceedings, this right protects against coercion, ensures accountability, and promotes the integrity of the criminal justice system. Upholding the right to silence is essential for preserving individual rights, preventing abuses of power, and maintaining the balance of power between the state and the individual in any just and democratic society.""","715"
"116","""The whole process of presenting Mulan, from choosing a story to tell to finalizing our product on stage, is like a journey of treasure hunt to me. The more I look back on the journey, the more I grow fond of being a storyteller. To be a better storyteller, each review right after the performance is indispensable and invaluable as well. Therefore, the aims of the following reflection are, first, to deepen my understanding of storytelling and second, clarify some important points of presenting Mulan on stage. This reflection will be divided into three parts: why Mulan was chosen as a story to tell, how she was characterised and what can be done to make the presentation better. Why Mulan? Women consist of half of the world's population. To glorify the importance of his opposite sex in China, Chairman Mao also said, 'Women hold up half of the sky'. Ironically, beyond the praise lies the reality that it is men who have been dominating in most of the places and most of the time. The proof can be easily found in the written records, be it in the East or the West. There has always been a tendency to marginalize or belittle women in history. As Hourihan points out in her book, for instance, women are few in the hero myth and 'most of those few function only in the domestic sphere' (997, p. 5/86). She also argues that the records of the hero story can be seen as a 'conscious campaign to marginalize women' (997, p. 5/89). Only when a woman engages herself in the public affairs - men's domain usually, can her words or deeds leave a mark in history. In many stories, women are always depicted with negative character traits. Most of them are wicked stepmothers, evil witches, undutiful daughters, or bad-tempered princesses. Tatar refers to these female characters as 'disagreeable heroines' (992, p. 8) in whom seven typical sins can be found - disobedience, stubbornness, infidelity, arrogance, curiosity, laziness and gluttony. These prevailing stereotypes of women in fairy tales and folklores serve a vital function of social conditioning. This is by no means uncommon in traditional Chinese stories. Most female characters in Chinese folktales and legends are either evil spirits leading men astray or pathetic victims only succumbing to their destiny. Disproportionately, the stories of Chinese heroines can be counted on one's fingers. Thus, after reading most sexually biased stories, boys may reinforce their stereotypes about their opposite sex to a further degree. What's worse, girl readers may unconsciously or subconsciously internalize this fixed image that women are secondary or inferior to men. One of our purposes of doing Mulan is to counter that negative effect on both male and female readers. Concerning the meaning of a story, it should be the core issue worthy of a storyteller's attentive consideration. According to Cassady, a story 'should help the listeners in some way to appreciate life, to understand a particular facet of living, and to rejoice in life's richness' (990, p. 6). Lavender also claims that myth, legend and lore can give us 'a sense of our own identity and a sense of security - a sense of belonging to the world, to mankind, and to the wisdom of accumulated experience' (975/8, p. ). In addition, Cassady suggests that folktales and myths are more appealing to children from ten to early teens than other types of stories. Since our target audiences are early-teenagers, the legend of Mulan may catch their eye and be meaningful to all listeners, especially girls. It is a story about a Chinese girl, who takes the initiative and plays a key role in her time. Different from those unfavourable female images in most stories, Mulan is an admirable heroine because she shoulders her father's responsibility to fight for their country and eventually has a remarkable achievement. Even in a modern perspective, what Mulan has accomplished is beyond our imagination, let alone for those living in ancient China. Notoriously, China had had a long history of the practice of foot binding, which was an inhumane means of domesticating women and depriving their freedom by causing their disabilities. In such a society, Mulan's story has still been kept, passing down from one generation to another. There is no doubt that many people, especially females, must be mentally inspired by Mulan's deed even though they are physically confined. How to Characterise Mulan? Like all the other legends, Mulan's story has proliferations and reproductions. These phenomena identify with Zipes's comments. He states that a legend, usually based upon an actual event, may be 'told in many different versions depending on the social and temporal context'(995/8, p. 5/83). In the first ballad version, Mulan is portrayed as a brave and dutiful daughter disguising herself as a man to join the army for her father. But this version does not include any specific descriptions about her characteristics and upbringing. In Disney's Mulan, we see clearly that Mulan has been molded as a western liberal feminist. She fights not only for the honour of her family but also for equality and individuality in an explicit manner. Undeniably, Mulan has become a household name worldwide due to Disney's adaptation and its global circulation network. However, not every Chinese audience appreciates Disney's Mulan because there is too much distortion of reality in it, such as the revelation of Mulan's true identity in the army, her saving of the emperor, the confusion of mingling Japanese with Chinese culture. Besides, the Chinese dragon is downplayed as a jester, Mushu, in that cartoon. Unwilling to accept these misrepresentations, we'd like to shape up our own Mulan, who is the very embodiment of traditional Chinese virtues combined with modern values. To truly present our ideal Mulan, we'd like to borrow the thorough analyses from Cassady. Based upon his suggestions, the role of Mulan can be analysed and characterised as follows: Important traits and background Mulan lives in a country embroiled in the turmoil of war and in a time women can only depend on men. Adept at martial arts, horse riding and archery, she hardly has the approval from her mother, who is worried about Mulan's lack of essential skills for an ideal wife-to-be. Mulan may appear to be as pretty, smart, and patient as her elder sister, but she is not self-assured. As a matter of fact, she is overshadowed by her sibling. Although she possesses some precious qualities such as bravery, perseverance and humbleness, she cannot see these traits in herself in the beginning until she starts her journey in the army. Motives Cassady emphasizes the importance of figuring out the characters' motives, most of which derive from the characters' backgrounds, because their motivations are highly related to their relationships with other characters and the purpose of the story. So what motivates Mulan to stand up against barbarians in place of her father? Filial piety and the defence of family honour are the answers to the question. It has long been the Chinese tradition to emphasize the paramount importance of family and filial piety. For example, in his book on Chinese thought, Greel claims that filial piety, for Chinese, has been not merely a moral but even a legal obligation since 1 th century B.C. These explanations of Mulan's motives play significant roles in our characterisation of Mulan. As they are the traditional Chinese virtues, we want to show them to our audience. Emotions Determining the emotions of the character can help establish the story's framework. In order to understand the feelings Mulan has gone through, the emotions line in the major scenes of the story is shown as follows: Theme Theme is what the story conveys to the audience as a whole. As mentioned, one of the themes of Mulan is to uphold the traditional Chinese virtue of filial piety. The other theme is to encourage our target audience to be who they really are and what they truly want to be. Like Mulan, some early teens may feel frustrated at not being able to find their self-identity. Mulan, however, finally gains confidence in being her true self when she stops imitating her sister and starts to do what she is really good at. This is also the message we want to get across to our audience. Mood It is also essential to decide the overall feeling of a story, its mood. Although the story of Mulan carries some moral messages, we do not intend to preach at our audience. On the contrary, we want the predominant mood in Mulan to be comical and light-hearted, which can not only serve one of the main function of storytelling - to entertain but also help pass the story themes to the audience in a less dictatorial way. For the creation of the brisk mood, we develop some funny scenes to show Mulan's kung fu, cunning, bravery and intelligence. An uplifting marching song is also sung twice in the performance. Except for the story analysis above, there are still some important points to be considered in terms of presenting the story of Mulan. Take the characters' names as an example, Cook has pointed out, 'it is always tiring to listen to a story which is cluttered with unknown names, especially if they are in a foreign tongue' (976, p. 0). She suggests that minor characters can be referred to as 'the king his brother', 'a nymph', etc. In Mulan, the characters' Chinese-sounding names can be confusing to our audience, who are not familiar with Chinese background. Only the protagonist, Mulan, is addressed with Chinese name lest the audience might get lost in the similar pronunciations of the other characters' Chinese names. All the other characters are simply Mulan's father, mother, sister, comrades, etc. The style of presenting the story is another major consideration. To manifest the Chinese style of the story, we incorporate many typical gaits, gestures and movements of Peking opera into our performance. The ways males and females walk in Peking opera are very different from each other. The male characters usually swagger with upturned the female ones need to move with small steps. Besides, the hand positions are equally important in characterisation. Riley has noted that the most female hand positions in Peking opera are related to the imagery of flowers. The orchid cloud hand are widely used by female characters. Regarding the hand sign for sword, the actor should straighten the first two fingers to make a pointing gesture with the thumb holding down the rest of the fingers against the palm (see Figure ). In our performance, we also adopt the fight routines of Chinese theatre, which, according to Riley, 'express total exploitation of the concept of roundness' (997, p. 10). What Can Be Done to Make Mulan a Better Play? It was a nice experience of telling Mulan's story. The audience seemed to enjoy our presentation very much and many of them were still singing the marching song several days after the performance. We are delighted with the success of the presentation, but we also know that there is always room for improvement. To begin with, I think we should polish our gestures, gaits and movements of Peking opera to make them look more professional-like. I learned Peking opera at primary school, which was indeed a long time ago. All the gestures we had in our presentation were drawn from my memory so they were not strictly precise. It would be better for us to consult someone with sufficient knowledge of Peking opera. In addition, we should increase the fluidity between scenes. For instance, the connection between the battle scene and Mulan's glorious return to the palace was not smooth enough and neither was the one between the palace scene and Mulan's journey back home. Lastly, the pacing of the story also needs to be improved. In the middle of the story, the pacing dragged a little bit, which made that part of presentation weak. To conclude, we are all looking forward to another chance of presenting Mulan after the necessary improvements are made.""","""Storytelling through Mulan's adaptation""","2514","""Mulan, the legendary Chinese heroine, has captured the hearts of generations through her courage, determination, and sense of duty. The story of Mulan has been told and retold through various adaptations, each bringing its own twist to the tale while maintaining the essence of her character and the themes of bravery and sacrifice. From ancient folklore to Disney's animated film and the recent live-action adaptation, Mulan's story continues to inspire and captivate audiences around the world.  In the original Ballad of Mulan, believed to date back to the Northern Wei dynasty (386-534 AD), Mulan is depicted as a filial daughter who disguises herself as a man to take her father's place in the army. This ancient poem showcases Mulan's devotion to her family and country, as well as her exceptional skill and bravery in battle. The Ballad of Mulan sets the foundation for the character's enduring appeal and the core themes of sacrifice, gender roles, and the strength of the human spirit.  Disney's 1998 animated adaptation brought Mulan to a global audience in a new light. The animated film retained the key elements of Mulan's story but added a whimsical and musical touch that appealed to younger viewers. Mulan, with her dragon sidekick Mushu and her band of misfit friends, goes on a journey of self-discovery and empowerment. The Disney version of Mulan emphasizes themes of female empowerment, courage, and breaking free from societal expectations.  The recent live-action adaptation of Mulan, released in 2020, takes a more serious and realistic approach to the story. This adaptation delves deeper into the cultural and historical context of Mulan's tale, portraying her as a warrior who must navigate the challenges of war while grappling with her identity and duty to her family. The live-action Mulan focuses on themes of duty, honor, and the struggle to find one's true self amidst societal constraints.  Through these various adaptations, storytelling plays a crucial role in shaping Mulan's character and narrative arc. The evolution of Mulan's story reflects changing societal values and perspectives on gender, heroism, and identity. Each adaptation brings its own interpretation of Mulan's character while staying true to the core elements of her story.  One of the key aspects of Mulan's storytelling is the exploration of gender roles and societal expectations. Mulan defies traditional gender norms by taking on a male persona to serve in the army, challenging the notion that women are unfit for combat or leadership roles. Her story highlights the strength and resilience of women in the face of adversity, inspiring audiences to question and break free from restrictive gender stereotypes.  Moreover, Mulan's tale delves into themes of honor, duty, and sacrifice. Mulan's decision to disguise herself as a man and risk her life in battle is driven by her unwavering sense of duty to her family and country. Her sacrifice embodies the ultimate act of filial piety and patriotism, emphasizing the importance of loyalty and selflessness in the face of conflict and adversity.  Another significant element of Mulan's storytelling is the exploration of identity and self-discovery. Throughout her journey, Mulan grapples with who she truly is and what she is capable of achieving. Her transformation from a dutiful daughter to a courageous warrior reflects a profound inner journey of self-realization and empowerment. Mulan's story resonates with audiences as a universal tale of finding one's true identity and embracing one's strengths and weaknesses.  In addition to the thematic depth of Mulan's story, the visual and narrative elements of each adaptation also contribute to the overall storytelling experience. From the lush landscapes of ancient China to the vibrant animation of Disney's film and the grandeur of the live-action adaptation, the visual representation of Mulan's world brings the audience into the heart of her journey. The narrative structure, character development, and emotional arcs further enhance the storytelling, creating a rich and immersive experience for viewers.  Furthermore, Mulan's character development is a central aspect of her storytelling across different adaptations. From a young woman struggling to find her place in a patriarchal society to a fearless warrior leading her troops with honor and courage, Mulan undergoes a profound transformation that resonates with audiences on a personal level. Her growth, resilience, and unwavering spirit inspire viewers to believe in themselves and their ability to overcome challenges.  The enduring popularity of Mulan's story lies in its timeless themes, compelling characters, and universal messages of courage, sacrifice, and self-discovery. Whether told through ancient folklore, animated film, or live-action adaptation, Mulan's tale continues to captivate audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Through the power of storytelling, Mulan's legacy lives on, inspiring countless individuals to follow their hearts, stand up for what they believe in, and embrace their true selves.  In conclusion, Mulan's adaptation through various mediums showcases the enduring power of storytelling to convey timeless themes and universal messages. From the ancient Ballad of Mulan to Disney's animated film and the recent live-action adaptation, Mulan's story continues to captivate audiences with its themes of courage, sacrifice, and self-discovery. Through the exploration of gender roles, honor, duty, and identity, Mulan's narrative offers a deeply resonant and inspirational tale that transcends time and cultural boundaries. The storytelling behind Mulan's adaptations serves as a testament to the enduring appeal and significance of her character, solidifying her place as a beloved icon of strength, courage, and resilience.""","1110"
"4","""The British project of Imperialism was driven by the 'scientifically' proven belief that white males were the natural, biological, superiors to ethnic minorities and women. Consequently, Englishmen considered it to be their right and duty to subjugate the populations of non-Western countries, disseminating their norms of propriety and their notions of what it meant to be 'civilised'. This essay is concerned with showing that this quest was glorified in the popular fiction of late nineteenth century England, and that the gender identities of English men and women were shaped and reinforced by the portrayal of 'uncivilised' people and uncharted, fantastical, territories. This essay will argue that the construction of gender identity is related to Imperialism and racism as the indigenous people of conquered nations provided white Englishmen with an image of 'uncivilised' people with which they could compare themselves to. Initially, it will be shown that the adventure story of late nineteenth century England provided young Englishmen with the belief that it was their right to propagate Imperialism because of their natural superiority to other ethnicities. It will then be shown that the subconscious dissatisfaction many Englishmen had with the restrictive nature of Victorian society was expressed in their enthusiasm for adventure stories set in societies ungoverned by such constraining norms. The contrast between English women and the women depicted in the adventure stories will be shown as reinforcing women's submissive role in Victorian society. Finally, the latent appeal to Victorian men in the adventure stories of a regression to a 'primitive' state reveals racist presuppositions. The essay begins with a discussion of the adventure story's role in reproducing Imperialist ideals. The adventure stories strongly conveyed the notion that it was legitimate for white males to be the rulers of other nations and cultures. Racism was connected to the construction of the Victorian white male's identity as it was believed that ethnic minorities were superstitious and depraved, whereas the Englishmen perceived themselves as austere, courageous and self-controlled; this led to the conclusion that only white males possessed the qualities necessary for governing other aspects of their character which would have been seen as taboo in Victorian society. Although adventure stories encouraged Englishmen to explore their identity, it can be argued that they served to reinforce the identities of women. The stark contrast between the portrayal of English women and 'native' women in the adventure stories reaffirmed women's subordinate position in Victorian society. The predominant depiction of English women was as naive, and in need of the protection by men from the savage nature of the Imperial world and the indigenous people that inhabited he describes as 'savage and superb; wild-eyed and magnificent' (Conrad, 890; 20). Despite this, the inclusion of any women in the adventure stories was rare. When women of any nationality were included, it was generally in the capacity of an adversary or as a vice for the otherwise virtuous lead male claiming a wife from the tribes that he has attained power over that leads to his been seduced by the lure of power attainable by adopting the characteristics of the indigenous people he was supposed to be civilising, whilst engaged in a struggle not to emulate Kurtz and abandon his notions of civilisation as well. Therefore, the male identity was shaped by Imperialism and racism as an inherently racist perception of other cultures generated an immense interest in the Imperialist project, which consequently produced the notion of the seductiveness of a regression to a 'primitive' state of existence in which greed and a thirst for power would predominate if left unchecked. In this essay it has been shown that the male identity in the late Victorian era was influenced by adventure stories through their dissemination of the racist idea that Imperialism was justified by the Englishman's right to rule over people who were too uncivilised to govern themselves. Imperialism also contributed to the construction of gender identity by providing the imaginations of Englishmen with an abstracted territory within which they could be unaffected by the finite nature of a Victorian society founded upon repressive norms and values. The role of women as a destructive force of the project of Imperialism in most adventure stories reaffirmed their subordinate position within society as it was implied that they needed to be sheltered from the harsh realities and the savagery of the oppressed cultures. This 'savagery', however, influenced the Englishman's identity by exposing him to desires which stood in opposition to the conventional ideals of Imperialism. It therefore follows from the evidence presented here that the construction of gender identities was related to Imperialism and racism through the emphasis that the Imperialist upon white British masculinity. The primacy of white men is conveyed strongly in the adventure stories of the late nineteenth century; 'white manhood' is portrayed as an example of civility and the epitome of the Victorian notions of propriety, whereas women and the oppressed cultures involved are depicted as inferior or dangerous. Imperialism, and the racism it is imbued with, therefore affected men and women's sense of identity by confirming that there was a natural order in British society and the Imperial world, in which white men formed the rightly dominant group.""","""Imperialism, Gender, and Racism""","1027","""Imperialism, Gender, and Racism are interconnected issues that have significantly shaped societies and cultures worldwide. Imperialism, the extension of a nation's power through territorial acquisition or political domination, often perpetuated systems of gender inequality and racism as tools to assert control over colonized peoples. Understanding the dynamics between imperialism, gender, and racism is crucial in unraveling historical injustices and addressing present-day inequalities.  Imperialism played a pivotal role in reinforcing gender norms and roles within colonial societies. European imperial powers imposed their cultural values and norms on colonized peoples, often relegating women to subordinate positions. The imperial project frequently reinforced patriarchal structures, with women expected to adhere to traditional roles as homemakers and caregivers, while men held positions of power in colonial administrations. This perpetuated a gender hierarchy that disadvantaged women in terms of social, political, and economic opportunities.  Moreover, imperialism intersected with racism to create hierarchies of power and privilege based on race. European imperial powers propagated racist ideologies to justify their exploitation and subjugation of indigenous populations. The construction of racial hierarchies served to dehumanize colonized peoples, portraying them as inferior and in need of civilization by their imperial overlords. Racism not only justified colonial rule but also laid the groundwork for the systematic discrimination and marginalization of indigenous communities.  The relationship between gender and racism within the context of imperialism further complicated the experiences of colonized women. Women in colonized societies often faced intersecting forms of oppression based on both their gender and racial identities. For example, indigenous women were subjected to the dual constraints of patriarchal norms imposed by colonizers and racial discrimination that devalued their identities and experiences. This intersectionality of gender and race created unique challenges for marginalized women in resisting imperial domination and asserting their rights and agency.  Colonial powers also exploited gender and racial stereotypes to justify their imperial endeavors. Racist representations of colonized peoples, particularly women, as primitive, exotic, or hypersexualized, served to reinforce imperial domination and control. These representations reinforced power differentials based on gender and race, further entrenching systems of oppression and inequality within colonial societies.  Efforts to resist imperialism, gender inequality, and racism have been ongoing throughout history. Colonized peoples, including women, have engaged in various forms of resistance to assert their agency and challenge oppressive colonial structures. From anti-colonial movements to feminist struggles for gender equality and racial justice, individuals and communities have mobilized to dismantle systems of oppression and advocate for rights and freedoms.  In the post-colonial era, the legacies of imperialism, gender inequality, and racism continue to reverberate in global systems of power and privilege. Decolonization efforts have sought to confront colonial histories and address the enduring impacts of imperialism on gender and racial dynamics. Intersectional approaches that recognize the interconnected nature of oppression based on gender, race, class, and other social categories have been instrumental in advancing more inclusive and equitable societies.  Addressing the intersections of imperialism, gender, and racism requires a multifaceted approach that acknowledges historical injustices and contemporary inequalities. By centering the voices and experiences of marginalized communities, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable world free from the legacies of colonialism. Empowering individuals to challenge patriarchal, racist, and imperialist structures is essential in building a more inclusive and socially just future for all. Let us continue to interrogate the complexities of these intertwined systems of oppression and strive for a world where equality and dignity prevail.""","703"
"6201","""Creon: So, men our age, we're to be lectured, are we? - schooled by a boy his age? Haemon: Only in what is right. But if I seem young, look less in my years and more to what I do. Creon: Do? Is admiring rebels an achievement? Haemon: I'd never suggest that you admire treason. Creon: Oh? - isn't that just the sickness that's attacked her? Haemon: The whole city of Thebes denies it, to a man. Creon: And is Thebes about to tell me how to rule? Haemon: Now, you see? Who's talking like a child? Creon: Am I to rule this land for others - or myself? Haemon: It's no city at all, owned by one man alone. Creon: What? The city is the king's - that's the law! Haemon: What a splendid king you'd make of a desert island - you and you alone. Creon: This boy, I do believe, is fighting on her side, the woman's side. Haemon: If you are a woman, yes - my concern is all for you. Creon: Why, you degenerate - bandying accusations, threatening me with justice, your own father! Haemon: I see my father offending justice - wrong. Creon: Wrong? To protect my royal rights? Haemon: Protect your rights? When you trample down the honour of the gods? Creon: You, you soul of corruption, rotten through - woman's accomplice! Haemon: That may be, but you will never find me accomplice to a criminal. Creon: That's what she is, and every word you say is a blatant appeal for her - Haemon: And you, and me, and the gods beneath the earth. Creon: You will never marry her, not while she's alive. Haemon: Then she will die.but her death will kill another. Creon: What, brazen threats? You go too far! Haemon: What threat? Combating your empty, mindless judgments with a word? Creon: You'll suffer for your sermons, you and your empty wisdom! Haemon: If you weren't my father, I'd say you were insane. Creon: Don't flatter me with Father - you woman's slave! Haemon: You really expect to fling abuse at me and not receive the same? Creon: Is that so! Now, by heaven, I promise you, you'll pay - taunting, insulting me! Bring her out, that hateful - she'll die now, here, in front of his eyes, beside her groom! Haemon: No, no, she will never die beside me - don't delude yourself. And you will never see me, never set eyes on my face again. Rage your heart out, rage with friends who can stand the sight of you. (Sophocles: Antigone, lines 13-5/89)This episode in Sophocles' 'Antigone', between Creon, King of Thebes, and his last surviving son, Haemon, gives a strong indication of one of the great causes of tragedy in the ancient world. This is the idea of a lack of understanding between a father and a son, because of clashes in opinion or thought, and through a stubbornness of nature, which is what not only brings about this lack of relationship and understanding, but also a large proportion of the tragedy that springs from it. In this case, the tragedy set in motion is a double tragedy, that of Haemon, who will die an unhappy death, hating his father and, ultimately, that of Creon, who will lose everything and everyone he has cared about. On the surface, this passage is about a conflict of ideas about Antigone, who Creon believes is a traitor to the State as he describes the treason that is the act of her burying her brother as 'the sickness that's attacked her', but who Haemon believes has acted nobly and rightly. However, reading underneath the words allows the reader and the audience to explore the deeper theme of how costly a lack of understanding between father and son can be, which is also a theme illustrated similarly in Euripides' 'Hippolytus', with the idea of the relationship between Theseus and Hippolytus, which is shown by the fact that Theseus unquestioningly believes Phaedra's accusation against Hippolytus, showing that he has never been entirely trusting of his son, and only realises his mistake at the end of the play when it is too late. This is not to say that Creon is distrustful towards Haemon in the same way that Theseus is towards Hippolytus, but instead that he is so consumed by the desire to appear as a good king that he finds himself putting the affairs of the State above everything else, including his family, which is why he 'fails both as a father and a civic leader'. Antigone; line 19 The Cambridge Companion to Greek Tragedy; p.04 Creon is an unusual figure in Greek tragedy, because he appears to simply be the 'typical tragic hero who collaborates in his own downfall', however it is clear that his character is not as simple as this. He is a man under an immense amount of pressure because he wants to be a good king and he knows that everything he does on his first day in office will dictate what the people think of him and it is this which makes him ignore other viewpoints and brings about the clash with his son in something familiar in Greek tragedy, as 'two strong wills inevitably clash - the son eager and impassioned, the father hardened by duty' as is shown by his words to Haemon 'the city is the king's - that's the law!', a view sharply contrasted by Haemon, who is very much on Antigone's side, as he fights for justice and for what he believes is right, despite the fact that he 'declares that no marriage means more to him than his father', earlier in the play, with the words 'No marriage could ever mean more to me than you'. This is not to suggest that Haemon is a hypocritical figure, but instead it shows Creon's inability to accept what he believes is an action against his own rules, or his own inflexibility. A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama; p.5/82 C.W. Collins Sophocles; p.5/8 Antigone; line 25/8 R. Scodel Sophocles; p.0 Antigone; line 11 It can be argued that Haemon is equally as inflexible as Creon in this passage, because he too refuses to back down on his beliefs that Antigone has done nothing wrong, and it is this which destroys any possibility of a father and son relationship between them. While it is true to say that Haemon is clearly on Antigone's side, he does not always make this entirely obvious at the start, as he does not simply argue her case insultingly to Creon, but instead he tries to use rational and tactful rhetoric to make him be flexible rather than firing personal insults on his father's judgement, even if he believes it to be wrong. This shows an element of flexibility on Haemon's part which is missing in his father, as he is capable of calm negotiation when he knows that hot-headed impetuosity will achieve nothing, but it also goes a long way to illustrating the emotional conflict with his father, as Creon is unable to see the situation from his son's perspective. With his words 'Why, you degenerate - bandying accusations, threatening me with justice, your own father!', Creon is showing that he feels Haemon is not only being disloyal to him as a king, but also as a son, once again showing the inflexibility which makes a functional relationship with Haemon almost impossible, and which ultimately brings about the tragedy of the play. This having been said, Haemon has faults too, which are exploited in his later words to Creon, as he tells him 'Then will die.but her death will kill another' and, even more powerfully, with his last words to him 'And you will never see me, never set eyes on my face. Rage your heart out, rage with friends who can stand the sight of you', which shows that, for all his earlier tact and rational speech earlier on in the scene, Haemon can be impulsive and insulting as he rages at Creon before leaving, his final words to his father later ringing true. Antigone; lines 31-32 Antigone; line 43 Antigone; lines 5/86-5/89 What is really interesting about the characters of Creon and Haemon in this passage, apart from the evidence that a functional relationship as father and son is impossible between them, is that, despite the fact that Creon has the authority over Thebes as king, it is actually Haemon who comes off better and has a greater sense of authority here, as he has the ability to be rational in the face of adversity which Creon appears to lack, meaning that Haemon comes across in a more mature light, giving an idea that, if he were a ruler and a father, he would be able to balance the two roles much better than Creon himself does. A figure of fatherhood is a crucial element in Greek drama, but especially in tragedy, as he can be used to illustrate the principles of tragedy according to Aristotle, which are that tragedy is 'an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete and possesses magnitude' in some cases by contradicting them. I will be focusing on will be Euripides' 'Hippolytus', where I will be exploring the character of Theseus as a father figure towards Hippolytus, and Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon', where I will be exploring the characters of Agamemnon and of Thyestes, the father of Aegisthus, to show how a father figure can also have a strong influence by being absent and also to show the conflict between fatherhood and kingship, which is especially shown by Agamemnon. Poetics - Tragedy: Definition and Analysis; p.0 The major father figure in 'Hippolytus' is the character of Theseus, whose son is Hippolytus. The audience first learns this from Aphrodite's speech, as she describes Hippolytus with these words: 'Hippolytus, son of Theseus by the Amazon, pupil of holy Pittheus' Hippolytus; lines 0-1 Throughout the play, Euripides makes it very clear that Theseus is the dominant figure of fatherhood. It is, however, Theseus' attitude towards fatherhood and towards Hippolytus, as well as his relationship with his son, which goes a long way towards the tragedy at the end of the play. Hippolytus is an interesting figure in the play for several reasons, one of which is the contrast between himself and Theseus. Hippolytus is very much an 'ephebic' figure, or a young man who has not quite reached adulthood. It is clear that he passes his time with appropriate pursuits for such young men. The first time he appears in the play, he has just been hunting and he has also made a garland for the statue of Artemis, a goddess of hunting. This is extremely important because, like many of Hippolytus' traits, it shows how he is 'detached from human relations and unchanging', not only in that he is showing no signs of moving out of the hunting phase into any other phase - in other words showing his unwillingness to mature - but also in showing one of his other major character traits. Hippolytus is chaste, in the same way that the goddess Artemis was chaste, and he intends to prolong his chastity, because he shuns marriage. Hippolytus' chastity is one of the factors which brings about his tragedy, because he is punished by Aphrodite, 'not simply because his way of life has no place for sex, but because he rejects it and rejects the worship of the goddess'. It also shows a huge contrast with the figure of his father, Theseus, who 'was known for a polygamous love life', even though, after Phaedra's death, he honours her memory when he says: Sophie Mills Euripides: Hippolytus; p.6 Collected Papers on Greek Tragedy; p.77 Euripides: Hippolytus; p.4 'There is no woman in the world who shall come to this house and sleep by my side.' Hippolytus; lines 60-61 It can be argued that this idea of Theseus renouncing his desire for women is a device used by Euripides to make him appear to have more in common with his chaste son Hippolytus. However, I believe that this is not the case, since, as the play progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that Theseus and Hippolytus have few or no common features and Euripides is using this device to show that, despite Theseus renouncing his polygamy in the face of his wife's death does nothing to give him similarity with Hippolytus, who refuses marriage and sex completely. Another facet to Theseus' character which shows him to be completely at odds with Hippolytus is his attitude towards the 'polis', or the city. It has been argued that Theseus and Hippolytus are so at odds here because they both take their roles to the extreme. The audience can see, in the 'agon' speeches after Theseus finds Phaedra's note after her death, how 'Hippolytus is practically an anti-Theseus and between them lies the world of the polis Theseus exceeds the status of a citizen Hippolytus never quite attains it', as Hippolytus actually says that he is: Long speeches in debate Theseus and Athens; p.18 '.no man to speak with vapid, precious skill before a mob, although among my equals and in a narrow circle I am held not unaccomplished in the eloquent art.' Hippolytus; lines 86-89 In admitting that he does not make speeches, Hippolytus once again shows himself as an outsider who does not take part in democracy. He also presents a strong contrast to his father, as Theseus is a public figure in the polis, as he speaks as if he is speaking to a public assembly, especially with the words: 'Look at this man! He was my son and he dishonours my wife's bed! By the dead's testimony he's clearly proved the vilest, foulest wretch. show me your face; show it to me, your father.' Hippolytus; lines 42-47 Theseus' story in the 'Hippolytus' is a tragedy within a tragedy, as it shows the fall of a great figure in just one day. However, the tragedy stems from 'Theseus being what Theseus was and a Theseus and Hippolytus', which is because the two characters are so different. There are differences of opinion amongst critics about why Theseus immediately believes Phaedra. Some critics have argued that 'by having Theseus instantly believe Phaedra, Euripides suggests that he has never entirely trusted his odd son', whereas others argue that 'Hippolytus a man belonging to a world apart' from the 'polis' and from what constitutes the average Greek male, which is what Theseus represents, whereas Theseus is the opposite to his son and so has never understood him. Personally, I am inclined to believe that the tragedy of Theseus, and also the tragedy of Hippolytus, stems from both these factors. It is Theseus' inability to understand his son which leads to an inability to trust him the way a father should be expected to trust his son and this is what leads to their downfall. The lack of relationship between the two is emphasised by Theseus' description of his confrontation with Sinis, a bandit he claims to have killed, and the idea of the rocks being ravaged by the sea, which 'suggests the whole realm of cruelty and bitter experience. in contrast to the innocence of woods-and mountain-loving son', which again emphasises their contrasting backgrounds and the lack of a relationship between them. Hippolytus: A Study in Causation taken from Oxford Readings in Classical Studies: Euripides; p.10 Euripides: Hippolytus; p.5/8 Hippolytus: A Study in Causation; p.15/8 See Hippolytus; lines 79-80 The Tragedy of Hippolytus: The Waters of Ocean and the Untouched Meadow taken from Interpreting Greek Tragedy: Myth, Poetry, Text; p.90 The final scene of the play, when Hippolytus returns, bruised and battered, is an exceptionally poignant scene, as it shows the relationship between the father and the son as it should be. There are two strong Aristotelian concepts in this final scene between the two. The first is the idea of 'recognition', which comes when Theseus realises his 'hamartia' in cursing Hippolytus with the curse of Poseidon and also shows the tragedy of how 'the prayers that become reality are the deadly ones', although he realises his mistake when it is too late, which can also be seen as a sign that he is also realising the true role a father should have towards his son when it is too late. The second is the concept of a 'peripeteia', or a reversal, which means that when something happens that should have one effect, it has the opposite effect. In this case, Theseus was supposed to feel justice that his curse had worked, when in fact, when he realises the extremity of what has happened, he feels guilt and pain. The Tragedy of the Hippolytus: The Waters of the Ocean and the Untouched Meadow; p.97 For his part, Hippolytus is able to absolve Theseus of blame before his death, as he tells his father: 'No, for I free you from all guilt in this.' Hippolytus; line 449 Like Theseus, Hippolytus has also had a recognition, as he 'rediscovers Theseus as a father', in the same way that Theseus can now recognise Hippolytus as his son. Their character difference which made their relationship so disastrous will still be there, but they have now finally learned to accept the other for who he is, even though it is too late. The Tragedy of the Hippolytus: The Waters of the Ocean and the Untouched Meadow; p.11 One of the most intruiging aspects of the opening play of Aeschylus' 'Oresteia' trilogy is the aspect concerning a figure of fatherhood. This is because, even without such a figure performing an active role in the play, the theme of fatherhood is extremely important and it comes across in several moments of the play in different ways. What is most interesting about this is the idea that a father figure is someone so powerful and influential that he does not have to be onstage constantly to draw the attention of the audience and, in some ways, dominate the action of the play. Indeed, the only male figure who could be regarded as being close to a father figure who is actually physically seen in the play is Agamemnon, yet even he does not appear until late into the action, yet he manages to dominate much of the action on the stage. In the 'Agamemnon', one of the greatest conflicts for a father who, like Agamemnon, is also a king and a warrior comes to the forefront of the play. This conflict is a conflict where the two different roles are set against each other and the character has different loyalties to the 'polis' and to the 'oikos' and is shown most poignantly by the choice that Agamemnon has to make before the Greek fleet can set sail for Troy where he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to placate the goddess Artemis so that the troops can set sail for Troy. The Chorus, when discussing this, initially show Agamemnon's unwillingness to commit such an act with these words: City Family ' fate is angry if I disobey these, but angry if I slaughter this child, the beauty of my house, with maiden blood shed staining these father's hands beside the altar. What of these things goes now without disaster?' Agamemnon; lines 06-11 Agamemnon's instinct as a father with love for his daughter is being clearly illustrated by the Chorus as they tell that he does not want to sacrifice his daughter, but that he also feels that he has to set sail for Troy to preserve his reputation, effectively putting him in a situation where he cannot win, because he has great love for his daughter, but he knows that if he does not sacrifice her, he will not be able to sail for Troy, and he will also be committing the sin of 'hubris' if he goes against the will of Artemis. It is ironic, therefore, that, when he returns from Troy, he commits a similar hubris when he walks on the tapestries laid out for him by Clytemnestra. This, arguably, negates many of his fatherly instincts, because the hubris he sought not to commit when he sacrificed Iphigenia has been committed anyway. Excess pride in defying the will of the gods. Agamemnon's fatherly feelings are, however, set aside and he does sacrifice his daughter, in a way that the Chorus call 'reckless in fresh cruelty', which shows him not as a figure of fatherhood, but instead as a king and a warrior who is doing all that must be done in order to go to war: Agamemnon; line 23 ' supplications and her cries of father were nothing, nor the child's lamentation to kings passioned for battle.' Agamemnon; lines 27-30 Through the Chorus' words, the audience and the reader now see how Agamemnon's paternal instincts have been repressed by his own and the other king's passion for war. This shows him no longer as a figure of fatherhood, but instead as a kingly figure who partakes in battles and wars and again shows how the role of fatherhood and of a king come into conflict with each other. Some critics have argued that Agamemnon's situation was such that he could not be to blame for his actions. In 'Problem and Spectacle - Studies in the 'Oresteia', William Whallon states a theory that 'Agamemnon is compliant, hesitant, vacillating before the altar' and that he and Iphigenia were mere pawns in the game of destiny, thus absolving Agamemnon of blame for his actions, as if he went against the will of the gods, he would be guilty of hubris. However, other critics have argued to the contrary, arguing that 'there is no intimation that Agamemnon was compelled by any god or spell to choose as he did', a concept stated by N.G.L. Hammond, and quoted by Whallon, which implies that Agamemnon acted of his own free will. My opinion is that Agamemnon did not want to murder his daughter, but he also did not want to commit hubris, thereby angering the gods, so he put his paternal instincts aside and took on the mantle of a king and a warrior. In some ways, the rejection of his paternal feelings is his 'hamartia', which brings about his downfall. Problem and Spectacle, Studies in the Oresteia; p. 1 Problem and Spectacle, Studies in the Oresteia; p.8 Fatal error Another aspect of fatherhood that comes across in this play is the idea of a father as someone who should be avenged if they are killed unlawfully or if they were wronged when alive. Aeschylus brings this aspect across through the character of Aegisthus, the cousin of Agamemnon. Like Agamemnon, Aegisthus does not make his appearance until the late action of the play, but when he does appear, he immediately gives off an aura of a son wanting vengeance for his now dead father. This idea is especially shown with his words: 'For Atreus father, King of Argolis - I tell you the clear story - drove my father forth, Thyestes, his own brother, who had challenged him in his king's right - forth from his city and home.' Agamemnon; lines 5/883-5/886 From the start, even when telling the legend of how his father was driven out of his home, Aegisthus already comes across as a son wanting to avenge the wrong done his father. Once again, a figure of fatherhood is very dominant and influential because of his absence and the effect it has on the characters and their actions. Now that Agamemnon is dead, Aegisthus believes that justice has been done and that he can: '.die in honour again, if die I must, having seen him caught in the cords of his just punishment.' Agamemnon; lines 610-611 Once again, Aegisthus is presented as the son wanting revenge on his father and he uses another figure of fatherhood, Agamemnon, to exact his revenge. This gives an idea of justice and of one figure of fatherhood dying for another. The interesting thing about this is that it is not Aegisthus who commits the murder, but instead it is Clytemnestra, meaning that 'the agent of punishment is an adulterous wife, but one whose daughter has been cruelly sacrificed', which adds to the idea of justice, and also presents Clytemnestra as an arguable figure of fatherhood, as she comes across in a very masculine and strong manner, which one could associate with a father figure. Studies in Aeschylus; p.6 Therefore, the father figure is an interesting element in Greek drama as he shows, even in absence, what a powerful effect he can have on the action, as is shown in the 'Agamemnon' as well as relationships, or lack thereof, with his child, and how the absence of such a relationship can lead to a tragic outcome, as is shown by the character of Theseus in the 'Hippolytus'.""","""Father-Son Relationships in Greek Tragedy""","5598","""In Greek tragedy, the complex dynamics of father-son relationships play a central role in shaping the narrative and character development. These relationships are often characterized by themes of power, fate, rebellion, and the interplay between generations. Through exploring the relationships between fathers and sons in Greek tragedy, we gain insight into the societal expectations, familial duties, and individual struggles that defined the ancient Greek world. From the famous tales of Oedipus and his sons to the conflicts between Agamemnon and Orestes, these mythological narratives continue to resonate with audiences today, offering timeless reflections on the complexities of family ties and the enduring significance of father-son dynamics in human experience.  One of the most iconic father-son relationships in Greek tragedy is the myth of Oedipus and his sons, Polyneices and Eteocles. The story of Oedipus, who unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother, serves as a tragic backdrop for the conflicts that arise between him and his sons. Oedipus, a man cursed by fate and haunted by his own actions, embodies the struggles of a father burdened by his past transgressions. His relationship with his sons is marked by a sense of doom and inevitability, as the sins of the father are visited upon the sons in a cycle of violence and retribution.  Polyneices and Eteocles, as the offspring of Oedipus, inherit the legacy of their father's tragedy. The conflict between the brothers over the throne of Thebes in Aeschylus' """"Seven Against Thebes"""" exemplifies the destructive consequences of familial discord. The struggle for power and supremacy leads to betrayal, bloodshed, and ultimately, the tragic demise of both brothers. Through their doomed fate, we see how the sins of the father reverberate through the generations, shaping the destinies of the sons in ways that they cannot escape.  Similarly, the relationship between Agamemnon and his son Orestes in the works of Aeschylus and Euripides delves into themes of vengeance, justice, and the weight of inherited trauma. The murder of Agamemnon by his wife Clytemnestra sets in motion a chain of events that culminates in Orestes' matricide. Orestes' act of avenging his father's death exposes the complexities of loyalty, duty, and the conflicting demands of divine and familial obligations.  The character of Orestes embodies the struggle between filial piety and individual agency, torn between honoring his father's memory and asserting his own autonomy. The conflicting demands of justice and mercy, duty and desire, underscore the moral dilemmas faced by sons caught in the shadow of their fathers' legacies. Orestes' eventual acquittal in the court of Athena in Euripides' """"Orestes"""" highlights the resolution of his internal conflict and the reconciliation of familial ties through divine intervention.  Moreover, the figure of Telemachus in Homer's epic poem """"The Odyssey"""" offers a different perspective on father-son relationships in Greek literature. As the son of Odysseus, Telemachus embarks on a journey to search for his missing father and assert his own identity in a world overshadowed by his father's absence. Through Telemachus' quest for knowledge, courage, and maturity, we witness the transformative power of the father-son bond in shaping the growth and development of the son.  Odysseus' eventual return to Ithaca and reunion with Telemachus symbolize the restoration of familial harmony and the passing of wisdom from father to son. The relationship between Odysseus and Telemachus exemplifies the ideals of mentorship, guidance, and mutual respect that define the dynamics of a healthy father-son relationship. Their shared experiences of loss, separation, and reconciliation illuminate the enduring bonds that unite generations and transcend the trials of time and distance.  The theme of father-son relationships in Greek tragedy extends beyond the realm of myth and legend to explore the complex interplay between authority and rebellion, duty and defiance, tradition and innovation. In Sophocles' play """"Antigone,"""" the conflict between Creon and his son Haemon over the burial of Antigone exposes the tensions between paternal decree and filial loyalty. Haemon's impassioned plea for justice and compassion challenges his father's rigid adherence to the law, highlighting the clash between generational perspectives and the struggle for moral integrity in the face of conflicting values.  Through the character of Creon, we see the tragic consequences of hubris and inflexibility, as his refusal to heed his son's counsel leads to the loss of his family and his power. The fate of Creon and Haemon serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and obstinacy in familial relationships, underscoring the importance of empathy, communication, and compromise in navigating the complexities of father-son dynamics.  Furthermore, the relationship between Peleus and Achilles in Greek mythology offers a poignant example of paternal love, sacrifice, and legacy. As the father of the legendary hero Achilles, Peleus plays a crucial role in shaping his son's destiny and character. The bond between Peleus and Achilles is marked by mutual respect, admiration, and mutual affection, exemplifying the ideals of familial devotion and selflessness.  Achilles' grief over the death of Patroclus and his subsequent rage against Hector in Homer's """"The Iliad"""" reveal the depth of his emotional connection to his father and the lengths to which he is willing to go to honor his legacy. The theme of paternal influence and guidance emerges as a central motif in Achilles' characterization, highlighting the enduring impact of fathers on their sons' lives and choices.  In conclusion, father-son relationships in Greek tragedy serve as a profound exploration of the complexities of familial bonds, duty, and destiny. Through the timeless tales of Oedipus and his sons, Agamemnon and Orestes, Odysseus and Telemachus, Creon and Haemon, and Peleus and Achilles, we are presented with a rich tapestry of narratives that illuminate the enduring significance of generational ties in shaping individual identity and moral agency. These mythological stories continue to resonate with audiences today, offering insights into the universal themes of love, loss, loyalty, and the enduring legacy of fathers and sons across cultures and centuries.""","1310"
"360","""The concept of burden-sharing in the context of forced migration raises a host of questions that ultimately spring from the question of what to do and how to deal with 'strangers' in our midst. In forced migration these 'strangers' arrive seeking safe haven, and particularly in cases of sudden mass influxes, place burdens and strains on the receiving host state. The Preamble of the 95/81 Convention Relating to the Status of that 'the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries,' and hence 'a satisfactory solution of a problem of which the United Nations has recognized the international scope and nature cannot therefore achieved without international co-operation.' This short statement raises a myriad number of questions such as what does it mean to have an 'unduly heavy burden'? What is the threshold of such a burden? What kind of 'solution' is envisaged and does it entail monetary compensation, or other forms of compensation? Is international co-operation a binding legal obligation, or simply an ethical one? This question was raised during Week of the Approaches to Global Justice module. The controversy regarding the use of the term 'burden' to describe refugees has been raised by various authors such as Noll, how a 'myth of difference' has been formulated to distinguish between refugees from the Third World and refugees from Europe immediate post-war period. The latter supposedly conformed to the individualist criteria of the 95/81 Convention while the former largely do not, justifying non-entree regimes. Weir,. Ibid. On further probing by the Chilean representative on the legal drafting of the paragraph, the French replied that 'the reference in the fourth paragraph of the Preamble to the undue burden placed on certain countries was merely a statement of fact, and was in no way designed to create a legal obligation.' However the debate regarding the reference to the distribution of refugees around the world continued to raise a certain degree apprehension among various delegations. The Chinese delegation declared that the Chinese government would not be in a position to fulfill this by accepting refugees from other countries although it had done so in the past; the Canadian delegate pointed out that the draft Convention did not contain an article concerning the distribution of refugees whereas this paragraph of the Preamble 'amounted to an acceptance of a decision on high policy'; and the Belgian delegate concurred with the Canadian. Ibid, 0. Ibid, 2. Ibid, 3. Ibid. Following this exchange, the French delegation noted that it sensed among some delegations an uneasiness at even the 'suggestion of involvement' and once again reminded others of the 'undue burden' taken by France adding that 'all European countries which ran the same risks should be conscious of the need for including such a safety clause in the Convention.' As the debate ensued, the French delegation persisted further on the matter of dealing with a large influx of refugees particularly with reference to continental countries. The argument made was that continental countries had no choice when faced with a large number at their borders to grant the right of asylum, or even refugee status. As a result, applying provisions of the Convention regarding rights to housing and to work would become nearly impossible without international collaboration. The Italian delegation proceeded to support the views of the French adding that they 'had always felt that the refugee problem was an international, and not a national responsibility.' Ibid, 4. Ibid, 0. Ibid, 1. The above debate clearly indicates that, as politicians and state representatives, the purpose was not to engage in the suffering of refugees but to formulate the policy that would be the most palatable. The French delegation may have sought to define the refugee problem in a manner 'equitable both to the refugees themselves and to the countries which grant them hospitality,' but the hesitation held by states on the burden-sharing paragraph illustrates the boundaries of such hospitality. Indeed, there was no discussion on how to specifically alleviate an unduly heavy burden, except for the reference to international collaboration, which was not expanded on further. During the early stages of drafting, an additional statement was included in the paragraph that explained how cooperation was needed 'to help to distribute refugees throughout the world,' however, this was dropped in later stages. In addition, a number of conceptual problems were not addressed such as how to quantify burdens and their cost, and more importantly, what are the precise responsibilities that burden-sharing entails. Weir,. Weir,. Costs can be of a direct nature, such as those related to refugee status determination, subsistence, housing, schooling and health, while indirect costs such as social integration are more difficult to quantify. See Thieleman, 27. There are no specific legal obligations to either regulate asylum or admit refugees under the 95/81 Convention. Indeed the main principle agreed upon by states is that of non-refoulement; states cannot send refugees back to a country where they fear persecution, but it does not create specific legal obligations to allow entry into one's territory. States are still given precedence to decide who can enter, and boundaries are as strong as ever today, particularly in 'Fortress Europe.' Burden-sharing: theory and conceptsThe commentary on the travaux preparatoires claims that the principle of burden-sharing proclaimed in the Preamble 'has acquired enormous importance in dealing with refugee problems' and that the debate illustrates that international cooperation was intended both in the field of protection and also assistance. Indeed, much recent literature has been devoted to the concept of burden-sharing both on the international and regional level, the latter focusing on policies enacted within the European Union, and this section will briefly outline some of the ideas presented and their critiques. Weir, 4. On the international level, the writings of Hathaway/Neve and Schuck in particular stimulated heated debate. Hathaway and Neve propose allocating the physical and financial burdens of protecting refugees through 'sub-global associations' of states composed of inner and outer core groups in a kind of insurance scheme. Inner core states are those specifically, and outer core states are generally not immediately affected by refugee flows and so contribution will largely take the form of fiscal support and the provision of permanent resettlement for a small number of cases who cannot return home. Refugees will reside largely in their region of origin with respect of their fundamental human rights, and the goal is eventual repatriation once conditions are safe. Schuck puts forward a similar scheme of allocating protection and financial burdens through the creation of a market in refugee quotas by a group of states, with each assigned a protection quota. States could then trade their quotas by paying other participating states to fulfill their obligations. Hathaway and Neve. Schuck. Hathaway and Neve. Schuck. On the regional level on the European Union, Noll has developed analytical frameworks based on risk distribution and public goods theory respectively. Noll approaches the problem by analyzing risk distribution along a game-theoretical approach, focusing initially on two host states that are negotiating the sharing of burden, and then expanding to involve other actors, highlighting how risks are shifted among players in 'criss-crossing alliances.' Noll argues that states adopt four main strategies to externalize costs and risks: shifting costs onto other states through a burden-sharing scheme that presumes agreement on cooperation based on expectation of reciprocity; pushing refugees to other countries, for example, through safe-third country agreements; preventing migration altogether; and significantly reducing asylum seeker's rights on one's territory. Noll. See also Betts and Thieleman. Noll, 5/82. Actors other than host states include sub-state entities such as federal: the Tampa boat crisis This section will look at the immediate response to the crisis and not its aftermath which is beyond the scope of this essay. The Tampa boat crisis is just one of several high-profile boat crises involving refugees and others include the Vietnamese boat people and the Indo-China exodus of the 970s and 980s and the 994 Haiti.The Tampa boat crisis is a cogent example of an utter failure to shoulder the responsibility of providing asylum and access to one's territory, thereby inducing great suffering. In August 001, over 00 mostly Afghan asylum seekers were stranded on the Norwegian freighter Tampa for over a week after being rescued from a sinking boat; although the Tampa was headed for Australia's Christmas Island, it was informed by Australian authorities that it would not be allowed to dock there and instructed to disembark in Indonesia instead. There were reports of illness among refugees, and conditions on the ship were cramped as it was only designed to hold 0 crew. Despite coming under great criticism by the UN Secretary-General and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Australian Prime Minister declared that, '.it is the right thing to do.and it was in Australia's national interest.' In the end, an agreement was reached for 5/80 asylum-seekers to have their claims assessed in New Zealand, and the rest in the Pacific Island State of Nauru. 'Australia defiant in refugee standoff' Fri 1 Aug, 001, URL John Howard, as qtd in 'Australia defiant in refugee standoff.' There were of course political considerations to his decision. An election was looming, and the public was largely supportive of the tough stance taken against the Tampa, particularly coming so soon after September 1th. 'Breakthrough over Afghan refugees' Sat Sept, 001, URL What went wrong with burden-sharing in the Tampa case? Was there a case to be made for Australia's 'national interest' to trump humanitarian concerns? Or did the Australian government fail to even extend the right to hospitality as outlined by Kant's jus cosmopolticum? It appears that the Australian government preferred to pursue the strategy of pushing refugees onto others as outlined by Noll. The Australian government signed Memorandums of Understanding with Papua New Guinea and Nauru in October 001 and December 001 respectively to host more asylum seekers intercepted by the Australian Navy. Savitri Taylor points out that the unequal relationship between Australia and these two Pacific islands which depend a great deal on financial assistance, played an important part in accepting the role of offshore processing centres for asylum seekers and that both countries were in a weak bargaining position when they accepted Australia's terms. The result was the shifting rather than sharing of burdens in a unilateral and unfair manner onto vulnerable neighbours by the Australian government, which exploited 'its asymmetric power relationship.to achieve an outcome that was more in its own interests than theirs.' Taylor,. Ibid, 9-1. Ibid, 2. Transnational Conception of Burden-SharingTampa is just one of many cases where states have failed to honour the spirit of the 95/81 Convention and failed to take justice and not simply legal considerations into account when formulating decisions. Taylor points out that because there was 'no clear legal obligation' on states to take the responsibility for these rescuees at sea, Australia 'took advantage of this lack of clarity' by insisting that responsibility for them lay elsewhere. Without an outright legal obligation to provide asylum it appears almost inevitable, particularly in today's political climate, that states will be concerned with limiting the number of people entering their borders than with the dictates of humanity. Australia insisted it was either Norway' to make, Taylor,. In light of the inequity of the current international system that has placed enormous burdens on already vulnerable countries, Santos asks whether burden-sharing should 'be conceived on a global scale? And will this be possible in an interstate system based on state self-centredness?' He suggests that 'a new and more solidary transnational conception of burden sharing' ought to be implemented, arguing that in the future, environmental catastrophes will be a major cause of displacement, thus exposing 'the dark side of capitalist world development and global lifestyles,' and making environmental refugees the ideal candidates for this new transnational conception of burden-sharing. The obstacles faced in actually implementing such an idea is recognized by Santos who points out that they are unlikely to fall within the competence of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In addition, Noll has noted that most Northern actors prefer regional burden-sharing to a global one because 'risks in a regional scheme are a priori more circumscribed than those in a global one, which increases predictability and facilitates consensus among would-be participants.' Santos, 26. Ibid. Ibid. They are also unlikely to fall within the 95/81 Convention definition of a refugee. Noll, 41. However, regional schemes also fail to acknowledge that 'many of the conflicts leading to mass refugee flows in recent years can themselves be traced either to the legacy of imperialist politics or to its pursuit in the contemporary era,' and hence the large number of states in Africa hosting refugees would benefit from a global rather than regional burden-sharing scheme. When taking this externalist view of the reasons for displacement, refugees become more than just 'necessitous strangers,' and it becomes clear that justice obligations are owed to them. Such a discussion is not entirely different from those raised about global justice and poverty or global justice and the sweatshop industry. The important point, as Pogge points out, is not just an exposition of the goals and values of global justice but the 'question of obligation' and responsibilities owed in the global context where harms are caused by a variety of agents. The debate concerning obligation and responsibilities was absent from the travaux preparatoires of the 95/81 Convention as shown above, and in the Tampa case, the Australian government neither any obligations nor responsibilities to the stranded asylum seekers. the example of the refugee outflow following the Rwandan genocide which was portrayed as solely the result of ethnic conflict rather than looking at the disintegration of the economic environment there following the collapse of the international coffee market and the macro-economic reforms imposed by international financial institutions that exacerbated ethnic tensions. Walzer, as qtd. in Seglow, 20. Pogge. Young. Pogge,. ConclusionSuhrke has stated that, 'in refugee matters, the logic of burden-sharing starts from the premise that helping refugees is a jointly held moral duty and obligation under international law.' However, the practical realities of burden-sharing have shown that most states, particularly those of the North, would prefer to shift their obligations and responsibilities onto others whenever possible rather than recognize the words of Grahl-Madsen who said that, Suhrke, 98. The burden of providing for refugees is a burden on the entire human community of which each nation has to take its reasonable share. The principle of non-refoulement is part of a sacred trust, but the principle does not stand alone; it is, indeed, closely connected with the principle of burden sharing between nations.Grahl-Madsen, as qtd in Cook, 46.""","""Burden-sharing in forced migration""","2986","""Forced migration presents a significant global challenge that requires a collective response from the international community. Burden-sharing, a principle that underpins the distribution of responsibilities and obligations in addressing forced migration, plays a crucial role in ensuring the protection and well-being of displaced populations. This concept revolves around the idea that the responsibility for assisting and supporting forcibly displaced individuals should be shared across countries and regions to prevent any single nation from bearing the disproportionate weight of this humanitarian crisis. By fostering cooperation, solidarity, and equitable distribution of resources, burden-sharing mechanisms aim to enhance the effectiveness of responses to forced migration and uphold the fundamental rights of those affected by displacement.  At the heart of burden-sharing in forced migration is the recognition that no single country or entity can address the complex challenges posed by mass displacement alone. With an estimated 82.4 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, including refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and asylum seekers, the need for burden-sharing has never been more pressing. Countries hosting large numbers of refugees often face immense strain on their resources, infrastructure, and social services, which can have far-reaching implications for stability and security. By spreading the responsibility more equitably, burden-sharing ensures that the impact of forced migration is shared among a broader group of actors, lessening the burden on any single host nation.  One of the key principles that underpin burden-sharing in the context of forced migration is solidarity. Solidarity involves collective action and collaboration among states, international organizations, civil society, and other stakeholders to support and protect displaced populations. This principle recognizes that forced migration is a shared global challenge that requires a coordinated response based on humanitarian values and a commitment to upholding the rights of refugees and other displaced persons. Solidarity not only strengthens the protection mechanisms available to those fleeing conflict, persecution, or violence but also promotes a sense of unity and cooperation among all parties involved in addressing forced migration.  Another critical aspect of burden-sharing in forced migration is the equitable distribution of responsibilities among states. This encompasses various dimensions, including hosting refugees, providing financial support, offering resettlement opportunities, sharing expertise and best practices, and collaborating on policy development and implementation. The principle of equitable burden-sharing emphasizes the need for countries to contribute according to their capacity and resources, taking into account factors such as size, wealth, and existing refugee populations. By ensuring a more balanced distribution of responsibilities, this approach aims to prevent overburdening host countries while promoting a more inclusive and sustainable response to forced migration.  In practice, burden-sharing in forced migration can take various forms, ranging from financial assistance and humanitarian aid to policy coordination and mutual support mechanisms. Financial contributions play a crucial role in supporting host countries that are accommodating large refugee populations by helping to cover the costs of basic services, infrastructure development, and livelihood support. Humanitarian aid, provided by both governmental and non-governmental actors, offers critical assistance to displaced populations in terms of shelter, food, healthcare, education, and protection. By sharing the financial burden and operational responsibilities associated with forced migration, the international community can ensure a more comprehensive and effective response to the needs of refugees and host communities alike.  Resettlement is another important component of burden-sharing in forced migration, particularly for refugees who are unable to return to their countries of origin or integrate into their countries of first asylum. Resettlement involves the transfer of refugees to a third country that has agreed to offer them permanent settlement and opportunities for integration. By facilitating the resettlement of refugees, countries can share the responsibility for protecting those in need of international protection and easing the pressure on host countries that may be overwhelmed by the scale of forced displacement. Resettlement programs often prioritize vulnerable populations, such as women at risk, unaccompanied minors, and survivors of torture or trauma, ensuring that those with the greatest needs receive timely and appropriate assistance.  In addition to financial support and resettlement opportunities, burden-sharing in forced migration also extends to policy coordination and collaboration among states and international actors. Through joint initiatives, policy dialogues, and capacity-building efforts, countries can exchange knowledge, share best practices, and work together to address the root causes of displacement, strengthen protection mechanisms, and enhance the resilience of affected communities. By aligning their efforts and resources, stakeholders can maximize the impact of their interventions, avoid duplication of services, and foster a more cohesive and sustainable response to forced migration.  While burden-sharing is essential for addressing the immediate needs of forcibly displaced populations, it also plays a crucial role in promoting long-term solutions to forced migration. By investing in conflict prevention, peacebuilding, sustainable development, and human rights protection, countries can address the underlying drivers of displacement and create conditions that enable refugees and IDPs to return home voluntarily, in safety and dignity. Moreover, by upholding the principles of burden-sharing and solidarity, the international community can build trust, foster cooperation, and strengthen the global framework for addressing forced migration in a more comprehensive and sustainable manner.  In conclusion, burden-sharing is a fundamental principle that guides the collective response to forced migration, ensuring that the responsibilities and obligations associated with protecting and assisting displaced populations are shared among countries, regions, and various stakeholders. By promoting solidarity, equitable distribution of responsibilities, and collaboration in addressing forced migration, burden-sharing enhances the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of responses to this complex humanitarian challenge. As the global forced migration crisis continues to evolve, the need for robust burden-sharing mechanisms becomes even more critical to safeguarding the rights and well-being of refugees, IDPs, and other forcibly displaced individuals worldwide. Through sustained commitment, cooperation, and action, the international community can work together to uphold the principles of burden-sharing and advance collective efforts to address forced migration in a more inclusive, sustainable, and rights-based manner.""","1144"
"384","""Sergei Pankejeff, a wealthy Russian aristocrat first presented himself to Sigmund Freud in February 910, in a 'pitiful psychological state' and entirely dependent on others for his many mental health practitioners today. This system of classification groups mental disorders via their symptom presentation and sees this as an important part of interpreting the symptoms of the patient in order to procure the correct treatment. The first edition of the DSM was published in 95/82 and was built on the fact that some symptoms of mental disease tended to occur together, these groups of symptoms could then be used to develop classifications of mental disorders, it therefore became necessary to have inclusion and exclusion criteria for each eventually be dissolved, as the only commonality this group had was 'an unsubstantiated etiological theory' (Marshall & Klein, 003, p.2). The concept of neurosis was replaced by new diagnoses of panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, social phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder. New groups of disorders were also created out of symptom clusters previously included in neurosis, these became; somatoform, dissociative, psychosexual, and impulse control person uses to interpret a situation. Ordinarily there is a balance between modes but in people with anxiety disorders one dominant and therefore all information is interpreted with reference to is now the dominant perspective in psychology as research evidence generally supports its effectiveness (Joseph, 001). From the cognitive-behavioural perspective Freud's handling of the wolf-man case can be criticised in many ways as cognitive-behaviourists believe that therapy should be kept simple so as not to complicate the clients problems, that it should be free of abstraction, brief and task-relevant. Freud's analysis of Wolf-Man's problems can only be seen to complicate them as he constantly tries to get at the hidden impulses underlying them, often by implementing hypothetical and abstract ideas. Cognitive-behaviourists would therefore see this type of therapy as unhelpful to an anxious person who is already confused and unsure of themselves. Psychoanalysis is carried out by allowing the client to say whatever comes to mind and it is also a very long and drawn out procedure, often taking years. This would be criticised by cognitive-behaviourists as they see anxious people as being in a state of disorder and as such needing a highly structured format in which to approach their problems (Beck et al, 005/8). Other critics of Freud have also criticised his interpretation of Wolf-Man's condition as they see it as arbitrary and assuming many things about Wolf-Man's past that there is simply no tangible evidence for. Critics such as Fish believe that the analysis Freud carried out was not so much an interpretation of Wolf-Man's condition but a persuasion (Fish, 998). Also professional bodies such as the Department of Health tend to advocate the use of cognitive-behaviour therapy in anxiety disorders, as can be seen in their clinical practice guidelines, due to the experimental evidence supporting this type of therapy (Department of Health, 001). However on the other hand the lack of evidence supporting psychoanalysis as a treatment for anxiety disorders does not necessarily mean it is ineffective. Although the form of psychoanalysis used by Freud is rarely used today, many therapists still use similar techniques and ideas, reconstituted to form what is now called psychodynamic therapy. Further more, evidence also suggests that brief psychodynamic therapies can be of use in certain conditions and although this evidence does not suggest that it is better than other therapies, it does show that it is more effective than no therapy at all (Joseph, 001). In light of our current understanding of anxiety disorders it is easy to criticise Freud's interpretation and handling of the Wolf-Man case as he does not take into account the biological mechanisms involved in the creation and maintenance of anxiety, and there is now some evidence suggesting that a cognitive-behavioural approach is preferable in treating anxiety disorders. However both cognitive-behavioural therapy and effective drug therapies had yet to be realized when the treatment of Wolf-Man was carried out. Therefore the therapy provided by Freud may indeed have been the best option for Wolf-Man, as other therapies around at the time can be seen as much less helpful than psychoanalysis, such as the treatment of taking baths that Wolf-Man underwent in 'Dr N.'s institute' in Frankfurt (Gardiner, 973a, p.7).""","""Psychological treatment approaches and critiques""","888","""Psychological Treatment Approaches and Critiques  Psychological treatment approaches play a crucial role in promoting mental health and well-being by addressing various emotional and behavioral issues. These approaches encompass a wide range of therapies and interventions tailored to meet the unique needs of individuals seeking help. While these approaches have significantly evolved over time, they continue to face critiques and challenges that warrant a closer examination to enhance their efficacy and relevance in contemporary society.  One of the fundamental psychological treatment approaches is psychotherapy, which involves a collaborative process between a trained therapist and a client aimed at exploring thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Psychotherapy is designed to help individuals understand themselves better, develop coping strategies, and make positive changes in their lives. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a widely used form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative patterns of thinking and behavior.  Another commonly utilized approach is psychodynamic therapy, which delves into unconscious processes and early life experiences to gain insight into current difficulties. This approach emphasizes the importance of exploring past traumas and conflicts to address present challenges effectively. Humanistic therapies, such as person-centered therapy, prioritize the client's self-actualization and growth through empathy, genuineness, and unconditional positive regard.  In recent years, mindfulness-based therapies have gained popularity for their focus on cultivating present-moment awareness and acceptance. Mindfulness-based interventions, including Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), have shown promising results in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. These approaches emphasize the importance of being fully present and non-judgmental towards one's experiences.  While psychological treatment approaches have significantly advanced our understanding of mental health and provided effective interventions for many individuals, they are not without criticism and challenges. One notable critique is the reliance on a """"one-size-fits-all"""" approach, where certain therapies may not be suitable for everyone or adequately address the diverse needs of clients. Critics argue that a more personalized and tailored approach is essential to maximize therapeutic outcomes.  Additionally, the cost and accessibility of mental health services present significant barriers to many individuals seeking treatment. The stigma associated with mental health issues can also deter people from seeking help, further highlighting the need for greater awareness and destigmatization efforts. Moreover, the shortage of mental health professionals in certain regions hinders the delivery of timely and quality care to those in need.  Furthermore, some critics argue that the emphasis on short-term, symptom-focused treatments may not always address the root causes of mental health issues. Long-standing issues, such as complex trauma or personality disorders, may require more intensive and long-term interventions to achieve lasting change. Integrating a holistic approach that considers biological, psychological, social, and spiritual factors is essential for comprehensive and effective treatment.  Despite these critiques, ongoing research and advancements in the field of psychology continue to refine and expand treatment approaches to better meet the needs of diverse populations. Emerging approaches, such as online therapy and telepsychology, have shown promise in increasing access to mental health services and reaching individuals in remote areas. The integration of technology and innovative tools holds the potential to enhance the delivery of psychological interventions and improve outcomes.  In conclusion, psychological treatment approaches are vital tools in addressing mental health challenges and promoting well-being. While these approaches have evolved and diversified over time, they are not without critiques that warrant attention and consideration. By incorporating personalized, holistic, and innovative strategies, mental health professionals can enhance the effectiveness of interventions and support individuals on their journey towards healing and growth.""","704"
"6004","""Food is an essential factor of life; everyone needs to eat to survive. Because of this, food safety plays a very large and important part in our lives too. Food safety means ensuring food is safe and fit to be eaten and does not cause harm to the consumer. When it arises that a food is not safe there can be bad consequences such as food poisoning occurring. There are many aspects involved in trying to keep food safe and a lot of opportunities for something to go wrong so it is very important that every detail, in food manufacture and once it reaches the consumer, is payed careful attention to. Food poisoning appears to be increasing. In 983 the number of cases was 7,35/8. By 993 this had reached 8,87 and the figures for 003 show the number of cases to be 0,95/8. Over 0 years there has been almost a four times increase in the notifications of food poisoning, even though there are now many more precautions and regulations to prevent this from occurring. These increases can possibly be explained with several reasons. People are now more aware of food poisoning and the symptoms of it, and more readily report it to their GP so more cases are being officially documented. There have been large changes in eating habits over the last 0 years, and more people are eating out more often, increasing the chances of getting food poisoning. There are also changes in food preparation, a large number of the population readily consume 'convenience' cook-chill foods using microwaves and may not reheat products adequately. There are a lot more people traveling abroad and eating food which may not have been prepared to the same standards we have in the UK. There are also demographic changes, showing that there are a greater number of elderly people due to people living longer, and they are at high risk of contracting food poisoning. There are three main food safety hazards; microbiological, physical and chemical. Microbiological hazards include bacterial contamination which can lead to food poisoning and is the most serious hazard as it can result in illness and sometimes death. Physical hazards include contamination by foreign bodies. Plasters, glass, metal wire, nuts and bolts, insects and wood splinters have all been found contaminating food products before and can cause damage to the consumer. The foreign body may also be contaminated with bacteria and could lead to a microbial hazard. Chemical hazards include contamination with pesticides, bird or animal repellent, cleaning and disinfecting agents, and other chemicals. To avoid this chemicals should never be stored near food and should be cleared away before food preparation begins. Microbiological hazards are the most serious and are the hardest to eliminate. These hazards include viral contamination, parasites present in raw meat or fish, moulds and yeast primarily causing spoilage but can also cause illness, and bacterial contamination. There are four main preventative measures against bacteria which should always be followed but there are many occasions where people are not aware of them, or do not follow them due to bad practice. This can result in the bacteria growing to levels which will harm the consumer. Food areas must be kept clean and good personal hygiene must always be observed. This avoids contamination from human to food. Procedures such as washing hands after going to the toilet and after sneezing or coughing means that bacteria won't be so easily transported from food handler to the food. Food must be cooked thoroughly to temperatures high enough to kill any pathogens present. This is applicable to cooking in the home as well as in the food industry. For example, there is a very high proportion of chickens containing the pathogen Salmonella in the UK and without correct cooking the Salmonella will not be killed. This means the chicken needs to be heated until the center reaches 5/8oC for at least 0 seconds. Any food handlers in the food industry must follow this by law but people cooking at home are not always aware of this which can lead to food poisoning. Temperature control is very important with the concern of bacteria. Most bacteria multiply very rapidly at temperatures between -3oC which is often called the danger zone. Foods must always be stored at correct temperatures, for example chilled foods must be stored -oC and frozen foods must be stored at at least -8oC. Bacterial growth is very small below oC and stops completely at -8oC. Food should not be in the danger zone for long periods and when cooling a product it should be done rapidly to prevent any microbial growth occurring. Cross contamination must be prevented as this can lead to high risk food becoming contaminated with bacteria from raw food. This is dangerous as the high risk food will receive no further processing and the bacteria will not be killed. Although these are very important facts, there are many people who cook for themselves and their families who are not aware of food safety and of good food hygiene and so put themselves at risk of food poisoning. Examples of bad awareness include people who do the food shopping then leave the food in a hot car for a period of time. This raises the temperature of the food and provides a good temperature for bacteria to grow, which may lead to food poisoning. If raw meat is stored on a top shelf of a fridge it has the potential to drip onto products below. This may contaminate a high risk product which will receive no further treatment so the bacteria will not be killed. Many of the public are not aware of the rules of keeping food safe. A food business has many laws and regulations that they must follow, these include the Food Safety Act 990, The Food Safety Regulations 995/8, and the Food Premises Regulations 991. Unfortunately, due to lack of training by managers, and the fact that the understanding of food safety has not been enforced to employees, sometimes they are not followed. There are also some food handlers who are neglective of their responsibility and deliberately break the laws. There are ways to prevent this occurring, by prosecution for example but the offenders are not always caught. If a food business is found to not be complying with the law they can be prosecuted. Food businesses include anywhere that produces or sells food to the public including factories, restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, sandwich shops. There is no tolerance for ignorance of the law and it is the responsibility of the owner of the business to ensure that all food handlers are aware of and follow the regulations. Food handlers should, by law, be trained and supervised in the work they do with food and there is much information available to aid with this. There are certificates, courses and many booklets and online information provided by the government, the local authorities and environmental health officers. Some businesses do not make an effort to gain the correct training and information they need and they pose a danger to the consumer. Environmental Health Officers have access to any food premises and can enter and examine the business at all reasonable times. If they feel that the business is not complying with the law then they can take action. This can be in the form of taking a sample of the food to test, to issuing an improvement notice to closing the business and prosecuting for not following the law. The Environmental Health Officers put in a lot of effort to protect the consumer by prosecuting those who are failing to follow food safety rules, therefore trying to ensure food safety. Penalties for failing to follow the law can be fines of up to 0,00 and up to six months imprisonment or in serious cases can be unlimited fines and up to two years imprisonment. 'Due Diligence' is one of the only defences if it can be proved that all reasonable precautions were taken to prevent the situation. If everything is on record that all controls and procedures have been set up and followed then the defence may be argued. With measures like these to face if the law is not followed, food businesses should be encouraged not to break the law, and to ensure that food is safe when it reaches the consumer. Not only will a food business be prosecuted and fined, there are many drawbacks of poor food safety and hygiene. If the business is producing food which is unsafe it could lead to food poisoning and even fatalities in serious cases, which would lead to a bad reputation for the business. It could also result in fines and costs of legal action being taken against the business by a food poisoning sufferer and could result in closure of the premises by the local authorities. It is in the best interest of everyone, consumer and food handlers to comply with the food safety laws. Poor hygiene can not only lead to food poisoning but can cause pest infestations, food contamination and wastage of food due to spoilage. The benefits from ensuring food safety are that the consumer will be kept safe, the business can gain a good reputation and there will be no trouble with the law as all regulations are followed. Even with all the benefits, and all of the drawbacks if the law is not followed, some food businesses still do not comply. This can be due to ignorance although there is a lot of information available to anyone who needs it so it should not be an excuse for poor food safety. It is the owner's responsibility to ensure that each and every one of its employees understands the law but it does not always happen. It is also because of naivety that they feel they can get away with breaking the law. They might feel by taking short cuts that it will save them money and they do not take into consideration the consumer's safety and what will happen if they get caught. There are also incidents of sabotage to food products which have occurred where products are tampered with to cause harm to the consumer or potentially to the business. There are also occasions where something goes wrong in the production of a product. There are several recent products that there have been food product recalls for. The Food Standards Agency has a system of Food Alerts where they notify the consumer and local authorities online. Marks and Spencer's 'Cheesy Spirals' Loved by kids meal was recalled on 4 th Jan 005/8 because it was found to be tainted with chlorine during production. On the 0 th Dec 004 there was a product recall on Tesco's 'The Snowman' cakes due to plastic backing sticking to the otherwise edible snowman image, presenting a choking hazard. There was also a product recall on some Inverawe smoked trout, the FSA food alert reported that it 'may not be safe to consume due to a processing fault which may allow bacteria to grow'. These are all prime examples of the three main food safety hazards; chemical, physical and microbiological. In this situation, even though these hazards have occurred, measures have still been taken to try to ensure consumer safety. There are so many aspects of food safety and hygiene to be considered and different controls that have to be carried out to prevent them. Even if all businesses were to follow all of the laws and regulations set by the Government, there is still a chance that the consumer can create a situation that can cause the food to become unsafe. A large part of food safety is down to the food businesses involved but a part is also played by the consumer. If every single person was to understand the importance of food safety and take the correct preventative measures then we could be nearer to ensuring food safety. The problem is that there are so many people unaware of how to carry this out and some that aren't willing to, that we cannot totally ensure food safety. Food businesses must take every precaution possible to try to ensure that when food reaches the consumer it is safe but from that point forwards, it is the consumer who has control.""","""Food Safety and Hygiene Practices""","2332","""Food safety and hygiene practices are essential aspects of any food-related establishment, whether it be a restaurant, a food production facility, or even in the comfort of your own kitchen. Ensuring the safety and cleanliness of food not only prevents foodborne illnesses but also maintains the quality and integrity of the food we consume. By following proper food safety and hygiene practices, we can protect ourselves and others from harmful bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants that can cause illness. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the key principles of food safety and hygiene, outlining best practices that everyone working with or handling food should be aware of.  One of the fundamental principles of food safety is cleanliness. Maintaining a clean environment is crucial to prevent the spread of harmful bacteria and contaminants. This includes regular handwashing with soap and water before and after handling food, after using the restroom, and after touching anything that could potentially contaminate your hands. Hands should be washed for at least 20 seconds, making sure to clean between fingers, under nails, and wrists. Additionally, food handlers should avoid touching their faces, hair, or any other body parts while working with food to minimize the risk of transferring bacteria.  In addition to personal hygiene, maintaining cleanliness in food preparation areas is paramount. Surfaces should be regularly cleaned and sanitized using appropriate cleaning agents to prevent cross-contamination. Cutting boards, knives, utensils, and equipment should be washed, rinsed, and sanitized after each use to avoid the transfer of harmful pathogens from one food to another. Proper storage of food is also essential to prevent spoilage and contamination. Raw meats should be stored separately from ready-to-eat foods to avoid cross-contamination, and foods should be stored at the correct temperature to slow down the growth of bacteria.  Temperature control is another critical aspect of food safety. Proper cooking temperatures are essential to kill harmful bacteria that can cause foodborne illnesses. Different types of food require different cooking temperatures to be safe for consumption. For example, poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C), while ground meats should reach 160°F (71°C) to ensure they are safe to eat. Using a food thermometer is the most reliable way to determine if food has reached the appropriate temperature and is safe to consume.  When it comes to storing food, refrigeration plays a crucial role in preventing the growth of bacteria. Perishable foods should be stored in the refrigerator at temperatures below 40°F (4°C) to slow down the growth of bacteria and extend their shelf life. Leftovers should be stored in airtight containers and consumed within a few days to reduce the risk of food poisoning. Additionally, frozen foods should be stored at 0°F (-18°C) or below to maintain their quality and safety.  Proper food handling practices are essential when it comes to preventing foodborne illnesses. Thawing food safely is crucial to avoid bacterial growth. Food should be thawed in the refrigerator, under cold running water, or in the microwave, never at room temperature where bacteria can multiply rapidly. When it comes to serving food, it is important to use clean utensils and serving dishes to prevent contamination. Food should not be left out at room temperature for more than two hours to reduce the risk of bacterial growth.  In food establishments, employees involved in food handling should undergo training in food safety practices to ensure they understand how to handle food safely. This includes proper handwashing techniques, safe food storage procedures, and correct cooking temperatures. Regular food safety inspections should be conducted to identify any potential risks and ensure that proper hygiene practices are being followed.  Practicing good food safety and hygiene is not only important in commercial settings but also at home. By following basic food safety principles such as cleanliness, proper temperature control, and safe food handling practices, you can protect yourself and your loved ones from foodborne illnesses. Investing time and effort in maintaining food safety and hygiene practices is a small price to pay for the health and well-being of those who consume the food you prepare. By being vigilant and proactive in implementing these practices, we can all enjoy safe and delicious meals without the worry of falling ill due to contaminated food. Let's make food safety and hygiene a top priority in all food-related activities to promote a healthier and safer environment for everyone.""","864"
"6118","""Extraordinary births were reserved for extraordinary people or beings. A variety of miraculous births were presented to the Greek audience, most frequently of immortals but special humans showed their almost divine like status through their beginnings. The births make a statement about the person or parents and differ them from the majority who go through the 'normal' birthing procedure. Firstly discussing immortals, there is a wide range of models of birth. Before the established Olympian generation there were others, the Titans, Cyclopes and her children to be released from inside her and so formulated a plan with them. She created a sickle and instructed Kronos what he should do with it. 'Then from his ambush his son reached forth his left hand.and speedily he shore away his own father's privy parts and cast them into the winds behind him.' (Hesiod, Theogony 77- 82). This extreme birth was caused by the fathers will not to be surpassed by any of his children. This 'ruthless struggle for power, a complete absence of moral standards and lawlessness.' is a popular reoccurring theme in myth as male gods especially, try to control and manipulate birth. Like his father Ouranos, Kronos is also incapable of controlling this force of nature forever. However before that is discussed, Hesiod adds another miraculous birth to the escape of the children from Gaia. 'And even as at first he cut of the privy parts with the adamant, and hurled them.into the foaming sea.therein a maiden grew. And she came forth as a reverend goddess beautiful. Her do gods and men call Aphrodite.'(Theogony 88-8). She is therefore the daughter of Ouranos alone. The theme of asexual reproduction is also reciprocated by the later 'generations' and will be discussed in further detail later. VERNAL, H.S. 987. 'Greek Myth and Ritual: The Case of Kronos in BREMMER, J. 987. Interpretations of Greek Mythology. London: Croom Helm. Pg 24. The Olympians were born of Kronos and Rhea. Kronos is also concerned about being overthrown by his children. However he did not keep the children inside their mother. 'And these did mighty Kronos swallow, even as each came forth from the holy womb.with this design, that none other of the glorious sons of Heaven should hold the kingly honour among the immortals.' (Hesiod, Theogony 5/83-6). However when Zeus was born he was saved from this fate and hidden. Kronos later is forced to vomit up the stone that Zeus was replaced with, plus all of the other - Hesiod, Theogony tells of the 'uses' of a wife and the possible isolated misery in later life without one. There is however another example of asexual reproduction that appears to relate a very different message. Hera herself gave birth to Hephaestus without the 'help' of a in a secret womb chambered within his thigh, and with golden pins closed him from Hera's sight.' There are discrepancies about where the 'second birth' of Dionysus takes place. In the Homeric Hymn to the god the audience is told that he was delivered in Arabia at Mt Nysa. This supports the promoted idea that Dionysus was a god from the East. Why is this important? This version may have been created because the Greeks did not want what he stood for to be Greek. The god of intoxication and wine did not promote the diplomatic, cultured atmosphere that Greece was perhaps trying to radiate at the time? Euripides, Bacchae Antistrophe of the chorus Immortals such as the Olympian generation are not autochthonous. Therefore Dowden argues that the myths were created out of the need for cults to have some foundation or beginnings. Maybe this is true also, to some extent, of mortals with interesting births. Ericthonios, the founder of Athens, although born of immortals, is not himself one. This fact may appear confusing but the analysis of the myth will show the alternative motive. He was '.born of his mother earth.' (Euripides, Ion 0) after Hephaestus's attempt to seduce Athena failed and the sperm that landed on her thigh was wiped off and thrown to the ground (Morford and Lenardon 003: 48). The story was adopted/made to fit/invented by the Athenians as their foundation myth. The way of his birth allows justification for exclusion from citizenship of the female population (Loreaux 993: 0). Firstly, the 'first citizen' was male but also he is born from the female refusal of 'sexual union'. Therefore perhaps making women seem unnecessary. The myth also supports the popular claim that Athenians were the people of the earth of Athens, they had always been there. This myth clearly has political connotaions as there is another foundation myth for Athens. This alternative does not mention birth but is rather a contest between Athena and Poseidon. Athena 'wins' therefore the city is devoted to her and takes her name (Parker 987: 99-00). There are mortals who are born from the union of a god/goddess and a man/woman. There are other interesting births however most of these are not new or different models. Birth during stories where metamorphoses has occurred, for example in Prometheus Bound, the child arrives while the female is still in her altered state; in this case Io was transformed into a cow. Also in the myth of Callisto, she gives birth to Arcas while at the time she is a bear. There is no clear explanation as to why these relatively strange births occur that is not part of the context of the myth; usually the transformation is a punishment or revenge for being seduced by a god. DOWDEN, K. 998. The Uses of Greek Mythology. London: Routledge. Pg 7 LORAUX, N. 993. The Children of Athena: Athenian Ideas about Citizenship and the Division between the Sexes. Chichester: Princeton University Press. pg Ovid, Metamorphoses, 09-07 In conclusion there are many themes surrounding the many different models of birth, most of which intertwine and connect together, often in a very confusing way. Most appear to simply establish a beginning on which the Greeks could make rituals and perform ceremonies for the Gods. Concerning Ericthonios his myth gave the Athenians an origin for their people, city and name. This is a very broad topic and more investigation into the role of mortals in different models of birth is perhaps needed.""","""Miraculous births in Greek mythology""","1388","""In Greek mythology, miraculous births were a common theme, often involving the intervention of gods or supernatural beings in the conception and birth of legendary figures. These extraordinary births were shrouded in mystery, wonder, and divine influence, setting the stage for the remarkable destinies that awaited the offspring. From heroes to gods, these miraculous births were pivotal moments that shaped the mythological landscape and showcased the power of the divine in creating extraordinary beings.  One of the most famous miraculous births in Greek mythology is that of Zeus, the king of the gods. According to myth, Zeus's birth was particularly dramatic. His father, Cronus, feared that his children would overthrow him, so he swallowed each of them at birth. However, when Zeus was born, his mother, Rhea, sought to save him. She tricked Cronus by giving him a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes to swallow instead of the infant Zeus. Rhea then entrusted Zeus to the care of the nymphs on Mount Ida in Crete, where he grew up in secret. Zeus's eventual rise to power and overthrow of Cronus exemplify the role of miraculous births in mythology as a means of circumventing fate and asserting divine supremacy.  Another noteworthy example of a miraculous birth in Greek mythology is that of Athena, the goddess of wisdom and warfare. Athena's birth was unique in that she sprang fully grown and armed from the head of her father, Zeus. The myth goes that Zeus had swallowed Metis, the goddess of wisdom and the mother of Athena, to prevent a prophecy that Metis would bear a child greater than him. However, Metis continued to counsel Zeus from within his stomach, advising him on various matters. When Zeus was plagued by a headache, he asked Hephaestus, the god of fire and craftsmanship, to split his head open with an axe. Out of Zeus's head emerged Athena, fully grown and wearing armor, ready to assume her role as a powerful deity.  Heracles, the greatest of Greek heroes, also had a miraculous birth. He was the son of Zeus and Alcmene, a mortal woman. Zeus disguised himself as Alcmene's husband, Amphitryon, and impregnated her on the same night that the real Amphitryon did, resulting in the conception of twins: Heracles, son of Zeus, and Iphicles, son of Amphitryon. Heracles' divine heritage endowed him with immense strength and courage, leading to his celebrated exploits and labors that cemented his status as a legendary hero.  Perseus, another famous hero, was born under miraculous circumstances. His mother, Danaë, was imprisoned by her father, King Acrisius of Argos, who had been warned by an oracle that his grandson would one day kill him. Despite being confined, Danaë caught the eye of Zeus, who visited her in the form of a shower of gold and impregnated her. Danaë gave birth to Perseus, who later fulfilled the prophecy by accidentally killing Acrisius during a discus-throwing competition.  These stories of miraculous births in Greek mythology highlight the intertwining of mortal and divine realms, where the intervention of gods shapes the destinies of extraordinary individuals. The themes of prophecy, fate, and divine parentage run through these myths, emphasizing the exceptional nature of the heroes and gods born under such circumstances. The tales of Zeus, Athena, Heracles, and Perseus serve as testaments to the enduring power of ancient myths to captivate and inspire audiences with their tales of divine influence and heroic feats.""","729"
"6050","""Chimpanzees can use signs, but do they have language? Language has been defined as ''the institution whereby humans interact'' (R.A.Hall, 964), as a ''purely human'' form of examples of this. In consequence, experiments were carried out teaching chimps sign language, to compare their ability of acquiring language with that of humans. Washoe, for example, in the 960s, was the first chimpanzee to undergo such an experiment. Allen and Beatrice Gardner, who introduced him into a group of adult ASL signers, carried this out. The results were encouraging: in years he managed to acquire 32 signs. Strong similarities were observed with child language acquisition: in the general word in the way he was able to put signs together to express small sets of meaning. This was done however at a much slower rate. Following this success, other experiments were took place declaring massive achievements in chimpanzees well as production of sentences and even abstraction, which is considered as characteristic of human communication. What Washoe and the other chimpanzees produced, although closer to language than anything else observed, still contains many differences. They may have succeeded in producing more than single word utterances, but these lack the complexity of the grammatical structure, characteristic of the human language. These are merely comparable to the utterances of a small child acquiring language. One must note that at this stage the child is said to be in the process of and not to have acquired language. Therefore how can we say that a chimpanzee, whose language is no more developed, has language? Furthermore, these experiments present many weaknesses: their standards were very generous, the evidence is merely anecdotal and the reports were on a particular animal in a particular experiment, when language is something widespread. Consistent evidence, in more controlled conditions is needed for these experiments to be considered as scientifically substantial. Finally, the explanation of the observations is not clear; the lack of grammar suggests that it is simply a sophisticated what they observe humans doing. It seems evident that chimpanzees can learn to imitate signs, put them into various sequences and use them in different contexts, but the explanation is unclear and more consistent results are necessary. What they have produced is also less complex and sophisticated than what healthy humans produce. It seems therefore fair to conclude that the communication gap, ability for language, between humans and animals is smaller than once believed, but still present. The period of the first 0 words is the first significant landmark in the child's acquisition of language. Many have tried to divide child's language acquisition in to various stages in order to understand its development more clearly. Vocabulary learning is the first most noticeable sign of language acquisition. This may explain why the period of the first 0 words is often viewed as the first significant landmark in this development. The period during which a child learns his/her first words appears to mark a change in the child's ability to communicate with language users. The child has moved on from simply babbling. The latter consists in the production of strings of sounds devoid of meaning. The first spoken words show that the child has learnt to control his/her vocal tract after the previous stage of experimentation. After this same period, which may also be seen to coincide with the one-word be explained by multiple factors, which most probably occur during the first 0-word period, justifying its designation as a landmark further. Firstly, the acquisition of phonology takes place during this time. Moreover, this amount of vocabulary is the 'critical mass' necessary for the child to discover in word meanings and to connect words produced with ones he understands, his/her learning therefore becomes more increased precision of vocabulary. One must note however, that due to the employers misunderstanding of the proper use and meanings of his/her first words (i.e. mismatches, overextensions, holophrasing.), some may not them as the being true language. Finally, the first 0 words may also determine different backgrounds, reflecting the culture into which they were socialized. The more vocabulary is acquired the more differences level out (after an experiment by C. Stoel-Gammon & J.A Cooper, 984). Although the meanings of words and their roles in communication may differ from those of experienced language users and the amount of words constituting this landmark period are discussable, children's first words still mark an important change in communication ability, therefore an important step towards their acquisition of language. Naturally occurring speech errors provide a window on the adult speakers language processes. Psycholinguists study the relationship between language and the brain, for example language processing. A lot of useful information regarding this subject is extracted from spontaneous speech. An example of this is 'slips of the tongue', which may reveal interesting patterns offering explanations on how ones mind constructs utterances. Various types of speech errors exist and are considered natural since they are spontaneous and produced unconsciously. These errors can be produced at different levels, from single sounds to whole phrases. They can consist of moving around the different units through shifts or exchanges, or involve repetition such as anticipation or preservations. However, substitutions of whole words can also occur. The 'tip of the tongue' phenomenon can lead to speech errors. In the effort to recall the required word, the individual goes through a series of mental processes, which may be reflected in 'slips of the tongue'. The speaker is likely to produce a word of a similar length, maybe even the correct number of syllables. Moreover similar sounding words are also likely to be confused, the middle of this word generally containing the error. This reflects how vocabulary is stored in one's mental lexicon and therefore the procedures used when searching for a word. Furthermore, speech errors rarely seem to change the grammatical structure of a sentence, and words from closed classes, which mark this structure, such as prepositions and pronouns are rarely affected. What is more, when words are transposed, they are generally semantically related. The grammatical brain works in different stages; this seems to show that the structure must be laid out before the content. Once the structure is there the types of words are probably chosen (e.g.: nouns, adjectives.), before their meaning is considered. However, when the grammatical sense of a sentence is not clear although it only contains real words one must consider a different explanation. This non-sense is often due to blending or exchanges, occurring between words or phrases. This is often due to anticipation or perseverance and shows that one does not construct ones sentences word by word, but phrase by phase or maybe even in larger groups. These errors are probably made because the individual is thinking about something else he/she said, or about to say in their utterance. On a smaller level, anticipations and perseverances on syllables or even sounds demonstrate the same kind of idea. Nevertheless, on all levels these are often the cause of repetitions. Sometimes when errors are made words can be substituted with others. An example of this is a speaker who said 'automatic transcription', when he intended to say ' automatic transmission'. These two sets of words appear to be linked through rhyme, have the same number of syllables and same sounds at the beginning and end of the words. This may be a reflection of how one organises vocabulary in their brain. However, since the meanings of these words are not linked, this phrase may simply show what the speaker was simultaneously thinking about while speaking. A lot of this work on naturally occurring speech errors seems to depend on different individuals' personnel interpretations, since they the speaker produces these unconsciously and one rarely finds out, but may only guess what they really wanted to say. This is why it is only far to say that they provide a window to the understanding of language processes and not an explanation.""","""Chimpanzee language acquisition research""","1572","""Chimpanzee Language Acquisition Research  Language acquisition is a fascinating topic in the field of cognitive science, shedding light on the evolution of communication in humans and non-human primates alike. When it comes to studying language acquisition in non-human primates, chimpanzees are often at the forefront of research due to their close evolutionary relationship to humans and their remarkable cognitive abilities. Researchers have conducted various studies over the years to understand how chimpanzees acquire and use language, with both successes and challenges marking this intriguing area of study.  One of the most famous examples of chimpanzee language acquisition research is the work done with Washoe, a female chimpanzee who was raised by humans in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Washoe was taught American Sign Language (ASL) from a young age by her caretakers and was able to learn and use hundreds of signs to communicate with them. This groundbreaking research demonstrated that chimpanzees have the cognitive capacity to learn and use a human language, albeit in a simplified form compared to human language.  Following the success with Washoe, other researchers embarked on similar studies with chimpanzees to further explore their language acquisition abilities. One notable study involved a chimpanzee named Nim Chimpsky, who was taught ASL by researcher Herbert Terrace in the 1970s. While Nim was able to learn a significant number of signs, further analysis of his linguistic abilities led Terrace to conclude that Nim's signing was more imitative than truly linguistic in nature, calling into question the extent of chimpanzees' language acquisition capabilities.  Despite the mixed results from early studies, researchers continued to investigate chimpanzee language acquisition using different methods and approaches. One significant advancement in this field came with the use of computer-based communication systems, such as the """"lexigram"""" system developed by Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh. This system utilized visual symbols to represent words and concepts, allowing chimpanzees like Kanzi and Panbanisha to communicate with researchers in a more structured way.  Kanzi, in particular, became a well-known figure in the field of ape language research for his impressive language skills using the lexigram system. Kanzi demonstrated the ability to understand hundreds of symbols and use them to communicate his needs and thoughts to researchers, showcasing the potential for non-verbal communication systems to bridge the gap between humans and chimpanzees.  In addition to studying language acquisition in captive chimpanzees, researchers have also observed communication patterns in wild chimpanzee populations to gain insights into their natural communicative abilities. Studies have shown that wild chimpanzees use a combination of vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions to convey information to each other, highlighting the complexity and richness of their communication systems.  While research into chimpanzee language acquisition has provided valuable insights into the cognitive abilities of these primates, it has also raised ethical questions regarding the treatment and care of animals involved in such studies. The debate over the appropriate methods for teaching language to chimpanzees, as well as the implications of these studies for our understanding of animal cognition, continues to shape the ongoing research in this field.  Looking ahead, advancements in technology and a deeper understanding of primate cognition offer exciting opportunities to further explore language acquisition in chimpanzees and other non-human primates. By continuing to investigate the intricacies of chimpanzee communication and cognition, researchers aim to uncover more about the evolutionary origins of language and the cognitive capacities shared between humans and our closest living relatives.""","696"
"3121","""EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThe following report aims to inform Monarka Hotel Group of potential people management strategies for the Monarka Hotel unit in Kathmandu, Nepal. The report compares and contrasts business environments. It is shown how Nepal's business environment differs from the UK's. The major divergences lie in the fact that Nepal is a very poor and underdeveloped country in comparison to the UK. For instance, its economic and political situations are very unstable. Indeed, Nepal has an extremely low GDP per capita and literacy rate compared to the UK, as its unemployment rate is nearly ten times higher than the British. The Nepalese culture, compared to the UK's using Hofstede's dimensions scores a higher power distance, a lower masculinism and individualism. It is recommended that Monarka should adopt an ethnocentric orientation during the first years of operation in Nepal, then to move to a polycentric orientation to finally reach a geocentric approach. The organisation should adopt a human resource management approach as much as possible, as opposed to a personnel management approach. By doing so, the company will be more strategically oriented and will focus on long-term performance by investing in training, rewarding and by considering its employees as assets. Resourcing the organisation will be a challenge, considering the weak condition of the labour market, but will be possible through a well define work design, and through a horizontal specialisation. It is recommended that the company adopts a diversity management approach when dealing with the differences between the order to make best use of these differences by using them as competitive advantage. All these recommendations are taking into account the unique features of the business environment and of the local culture, in order for the human resource strategy and for the company to be integrated as much as possible in the new environment..The dynamic competitive international business environment of the twenty-first century has brought companies to manage daily operation in different countries, with different cultures. The present report follows the decision of Monarka Hotel Group to open a subsidiary in Nepal. Funded in 95/82, Monarka hotel group is a UK based hotel chain which operates different brands in all continents, including Asia. A recent marketing study has shown the viability of the Monarka Hotel brand in it is only.% of the workforce for the if they accept that power is distributed in the UK, where low power distance indicates that organisations tend to be more decentralised, considering employees and managers on the same level. According to Hofstede, a high power distance is representative of poorer. Technological factorThe technological and environmental factors are the ones that less influences the management of human resource. It is nonetheless important to understand differences in the way business is conducted, and they can even help in understanding cultural differences. Representative of the level of development, the Nepalese technological environment present important deficiencies. Although it has a lot of the architect role, which makes long-term strategic categorises organisations depending on the extent to which they adapt their practices to the host to the parent. Ethnocentric orientationThe ethnocentric orientation values PCNs as key managers for the subsidiaries of the organisation. The global policies of the organisation reflect those of the home country, where most of the decisions are requires lower skilled employees that often are easily intrinsic factors are valued, as employees will be able to work autonomously to a certain degree. Hales approach to work design proposes a grid to categorise different forms of re-design from horizontal to vertical de-specialisation of jobs to an organisational and individual level. The horizontal specialisation would be appropriate at an organisational level since it emphasises the creation of sub-units in each function, i.e. group two main groups of employees to meet flexibility. The first group, the core group, is formed of the primary labour work full-time in the organisation, provide functional flexibility and are committed to the organisation. The second group is the peripheral group, where the organisation offers them just a job rather than a career. It is divided in first and second peripheral groups. The first peripheral group is numerically flexible, i.e. composed of workers that may be self-employed as they do not usually work for the firm. The second peripheral group has temporal and numerical flexibility as it is formed mainly of part-time workers. Although the organisation will need workers from all these groups to meet high levels of demand, it will aim to offer career opportunities to its core group. It will also provide opportunities to employees of the peripheral group that demonstrate loyalty and motivation to the firm to move into the core group, enhancing a strong internal labour market through internal promotion. The firm could also employ students form the Hospitality Academy as second labour market and peripheral group in order to meet high levels of demand.. MOTIVATION AND REWARDOffering a luxury product that requires skilled staff and aiming to have highly committed workforce, Monarka in Nepal will have to offer appropriate motivation and rewards. There are two main types of reward: a performance based bonus at the end of the year. The performance bonus, though it is difficult to evaluate since it is often intangible, will be given equally, according to the global performance of the hotel. This approach will enhance manager's tendency to work in synergy through a common goal. Informal rewards also have to be considered. In fact, due to the nature of the industry, employees have access to substantial amounts of informal rewards as staff meals, tips, fiddles and knock- key managers. Expatriation refers to the process of international transfer of managers, although the term expatriate is mostly used to describe a strategic approach to investing in human capital'. As discussed previously, a human resource management approach will be taken toward the employees, as opposed to a personnel management approach. This implies that the company will consider training as an investment and will aspire to improve the quality of its recruits. Also, with the low uncertainty avoidance feature, the company will focus on empowerment of the staff, i.e. the ability to take decisions independently. Nevertheless, formal on-the-job training will be crucial for the operational staff. In fact, training in Monarka will be seen as an integral part of the organisational strategy. As the company aims to move from an ethnocentric orientation to a polycentric and, with strong internal labour market, it is logical that the company promotes continuous development of its workforce in order to encourage promotions within the organisation. It will be important that the international trained or have worked in another Monarka hotel before having the opportunity to go in Nepal. To receive training on the Nepalese culture would also minimise the potential inability to cope with the cultural difference. Moreover, as the local workforce is very low-skilled and as the organisation wants to integrate with the local culture, it will refer to local organisations, governmental and institutional programmes for the training of its core workforce. Finally, as the organisation wants to move toward a geocentric approach, it would be appropriate to provide the chance to some local managers to benefit from a training experience in other subsidiaries in Europe or Asia.. MANAGING DIVERSITY AND EQUALITYWith globalisation, frontiers between countries are dissipating as their population gets more culturally diverse. Minority groups face disadvantages and organisations must develop policies and strategies in order to minimise discrimination and to maximise the potential opportunities created by this diversity of the with the purpose of reducing discrimination, or a diversity, in order to maximise the potential of each for its operational workforce, it is logical that it tends to focus on the DM as well. In fact, in the DM approach, employees are expected to work in harmony, and line managers are considered as the key managers. The DM focuses on the individual by giving opportunities to all its employees. This characteristic suits the strong internal labour market orientation by giving the opportunities to operational staff to become managers. As the Nepalese population is very comparing them, and then justified human resource management strategies in term of strategic orientation, human resource management approach, resourcing, rewarding, training and managing diversity. Although the Nepalese environment presents several lacks, the most important of them being a very weak and low-skilled labour market, the analysis showed the viability of an effective human resource strategy. The research being conducted in the UK, it is based on secondary data only. Nepal being underdeveloped, some information seems not to be available at all, which limits to some extent the strength of the analysis. Furthermore, the validity some sources can be questioned since a lot of information on the country has been found on government websites, which could tend to modify some information to their advantage. Nevertheless, substantial theoretical research has also been conducted, which provides a strong basis for the viability of the proposed Monarka human resource strategy in Nepal.""","""Human Resource Management in Nepal""","1760","""Human Resource Management (HRM) in Nepal is a crucial aspect of organizational success, focusing on maximizing the performance of employees to achieve strategic objectives. In a country like Nepal, where the labor force is diverse and the business landscape is evolving rapidly, effective HRM practices are essential for attracting, developing, and retaining talent. Let's delve into the key aspects of HRM in Nepal and explore how organizations can optimize their human capital for sustainable growth.  Recruitment and Selection are integral parts of HRM in Nepal. Companies need to adopt strategies that align with the local labor market dynamics and cultural norms. Nepalese organizations often prioritize referrals and social networks for recruitment due to the trust-based society. Additionally, understanding the legal framework is crucial to ensure compliance with labor laws and regulations related to hiring practices.  Training and Development play a vital role in enhancing employee skills and competencies. In Nepal, organizations are investing in training programs to bridge the skill gap and improve employee productivity. Especially in industries like tourism, hospitality, and technology, where upskilling is crucial due to changing market demands. Embracing a culture of continuous learning can help employees adapt to industry trends and technological advancements.  Performance Management is another critical area of HRM in Nepal. Establishing clear performance metrics and providing regular feedback are essential for employee motivation and growth. Nepalese organizations are increasingly adopting performance appraisal systems to evaluate employee performance objectively and identify areas for improvement. Performance-based incentives and recognition programs can further enhance employee engagement and retention.  Employee Relations and Welfare are paramount for maintaining a positive work environment. In Nepal, where hierarchical structures are prevalent, fostering open communication channels and promoting a culture of transparency can improve employee morale and satisfaction. Employee welfare initiatives, such as health and safety programs, are also gaining importance to ensure the well-being of employees in the workplace.  Compensation and Benefits are critical components of HRM that are evolving in Nepal. With the rising cost of living and competitive job market, organizations need to offer attractive compensation packages to attract and retain top talent. Implementing fair and transparent salary structures, along with benefits like health insurance and retirement plans, can help in employee retention and loyalty.  Diversity and Inclusion are gaining traction in HRM practices in Nepal. Embracing diversity in the workplace by promoting gender equality, inclusivity of ethnic minorities, and creating a safe space for all employees regardless of background can lead to a more innovative and engaged workforce. Nepalese organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of diversity for driving creativity and competitiveness.  Strategic HR Planning is essential for aligning HRM practices with organizational goals. By forecasting future workforce needs, identifying skill gaps, and developing talent pipelines, organizations in Nepal can create a sustainable HR strategy that supports long-term growth and success. Strategic HR planning also involves succession planning to ensure continuity in leadership positions and key roles within the organization.  In conclusion, Human Resource Management in Nepal is undergoing significant transformations to meet the demands of a dynamic business environment. By focusing on recruitment, training, performance management, employee relations, compensation, diversity, and strategic planning, organizations in Nepal can effectively manage their human capital for sustainable growth and competitive advantage in the global market. Embracing best practices in HRM will not only enhance organizational performance but also contribute to the overall development of the workforce and economy in Nepal.""","662"
"6126","""Applied Linguistics is the study of language in the real world - how it is really used by individuals and throughout society. Linguists find conclusions about language use by studying examples of it, by collecting evidence and analysing it. One way of doing this is by searching 'concordance lines', which provide multiple examples of words or phrases in their context in a particular corpus. Critical Discourse Analysis allows the linguist to study the relationship between linguistic choices and prove their point and persuade the reader that the agency is failing and should be shut down. In Applied Linguistics, it is important to study language that is used in the world today. The field itself is the relation of knowledge about language to decision making in the real world. For example, if one uses Corpus Linguistics, you can examine a particular word or phrase as it is actually used, and use the results of the investigation to make further decisions about language. It is through Applied Language Studies that linguists find answers about the language itself. The studying of the newspaper article, 'CSA RIP' provided results that show how the writer adapted language to make the reader feel a certain way. Such findings will in turn help to develop knowledge about information and persuasion in language. These two cases of the application of Applied Language Studies to language in the real world are fine examples of its importance in a society where linguistic interaction is vital.""","""Applied Linguistics and language usage""","277","""Applied Linguistics is a field that delves into practical applications of language research and theory. It focuses on how language is used in real-life situations, such as language teaching, translation, and speech therapy. One key aspect is understanding how people acquire, use, and interpret language in various contexts. Language usage plays a crucial role in communication, shaping interactions in professional, social, and cultural settings. Applied Linguistics helps analyze language patterns, variations, and changes to improve communication and language learning strategies. It examines the impact of different languages and dialects on individuals and societies, promoting cross-cultural understanding and effective communication. By studying language structure, meaning, and usage, Applied Linguistics helps address language-related challenges like bilingualism, language disorders, and language teaching methodologies. It also explores the influence of technology on language use, such as in digital communication and artificial intelligence. Understanding language usage through an Applied Linguistics lens leads to more effective communication strategies, language policies, and education programs catering to diverse linguistic needs. In essence, Applied Linguistics serves as a bridge between linguistic research and practical language applications, enhancing our understanding of language in society and facilitating better communication across diverse language backgrounds.""","234"
"6033","""Rome was a polytheistic society in which religion was a major part of life, thus in order to maintain power Augustus needed to place himself at the centre. He achieved this by creating an ambiguous image of himself which was somewhere between man and god. In order to do this he used a variety of public mediums such as statues, altars, coinage and literature. This can further be seen in his actions, for example the changing of his name from Octavian to Augustus following the victory at Actium, and the further renaming of the month of August. However, a society accustomed to being run by a group of senators would not have welcomed an autocratic leader imposing himself on them and calling himself a god. For this reason Augustus had to be very careful with the way in which he used these mediums, so as not to appear tyrannical and end up dead like his predecessor Caesar. Restoration When Augustus finally came to power after defeating Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium in 1BC, Rome had been in political unrest for a long time. The people were discontent with this situation and would have welcomed the idea of peace. Many Romans entertained the thought that the civil wars were the result of their neglect of the gods, and Augustus exploited this. He began a major restoration programme which restored many of the temples to their former glory: 'Consul for the sixth time, I rebuilt eighty-two temples of the gods.' Res Gestae 0.He built many temples as well, for example he built a temple to Apollo which he promised he would do if he were to win the war. Along with this was the Mars Ultor which he dedicated to Mars after his help with the battle of Actium. He also reinstated many religious cults, such as the Arval Brethren, whose job it was to say prayers and perform sacrifice for the safety of the imperial family. This showed people that he was a very pious man. 'Pietas' was an extremely important concept in ancient Rome and positions of priesthood were linked with positions of high political standing. This allowed for Augustus to cultivate even more support as he could appoint his followers into priesthoods and therefore reward their support with power. Zanker, P. The Power of images in the age of Augustus. PersComm, Lecture, //. Lecture, // idea of having a ruler as a god was a foreign concept from the Orient. It had been adopted to an extent in Greece and was in long term use in Egypt, but to the Romans it was a completely perverse way of thinking to their relatively contemporary republican ideology. Hence why Augustus had to be so careful about presenting himself not as a god, but as between god and man. He was accepted as a god straight off in conquered eastern countries such as Egypt, and since the Romans often adopted parts of the religions of the countries they conquered, many Roman generals may have been more susceptible to this ruler cult. This seemed to spread throughout Augustus' and the subsequent emperors' reigns until eventually emperors such as Domition were worshipped openly as deities during their lifetimes. Wallace-Hadrill, A. Augustan Rome, pg80 Further to this religious revival, Augustus had his name changed from Octavian. This wasn't unusual in Roman society; people who had done great things for Rome often changed their name to reflect this. However, the name Augustus has certain connotations to it that are slightly more unusual than most. Firstly it is one of the names used for Jupiter. August is also the name for things of sacred value and of temples, furthermore it is like the word 'auguries' through whom the will of the gods is foretold. He then went on to change the name of the eighth month of our year to August. The way in which this was done was very careful so as not to put forward the idea that he actually was divine, simply that he was more than the average mortal; somewhere in between. Wallace-Hadrill, A. Augustan Rome, pg 6 StatuesMany statues were built by Augustus which demonstrates to us the way in which he wanted to be perceived. The Ara a major example. Built between 3 and BC, it celebrated the return of Augustus from campaigns in Gaul and Spain and was decorated with religious images. On the south Frieze of the Altar, Augustus is shown performing a religious ritual. This presents him as a mediator between gods and mortals and therefore as having a 'special relationship' with the gods. He is presented as pious here as he is wearing a toga over his head, and is bare footed, a sign of divinity. Links can be made to his image and that of Aeneas' image on another frieze of the Altar as Aeneas also has a toga ceremoniously covering his head; they are both pious men. Appropriately for this gods are represented on different panels to that of Augustus and the Imperial family. Raaflaub, K.A & Toher, M. Between Republic and Empire Interpretations of Augustus and his Empire, Ch 5/8 Another statue used by Augustus to put forward this semi-divine view is the Prima Porta. This shows Augustus wearing a breast plate with elaborate scenes of the gods on it, linking him to them and indicating that his military prowess is due to his being favoured by the gods. Furthermore, he is pictured with cupid riding a dolphin at his feet, indicating some kind of divine intervention in his life. This could also be linked to his association with Aeneas since he was the son of Venus and Cupid is closely linked to Venus. Lastly he is pictured holding a staff and being barefoot. These two things are often associated with the gods, although the idea of being barefoot does not seem to agree with the image of him in armour and so further indicates that this sculpture is for creating an image of him as opposed to simply presenting him in a realistic way. All these images would combine to give the people of Rome the idea that Augustus was something special. However he is still depicted as human as he is wearing armour and has no obvious facial resemblances to any gods; he has simply adopted some of their attributes. PersComm. Seminar, 0//4. (KS) Another portrait of Augustus to be analysed is the one of him as Pontifex Maximus. In this he is seen as heavily pious, in contradiction to the last one where he is seen more as a warrior. He is once again barefoot, this time in keeping with the theme of the painting. He is also dressed like a priest with a toga over his head suggesting that he was making a libation with the hand that has since dropped off. This is the number one image found of Augustus; the pious image. It is important as it ties in with his revival of the moral agenda and puts religion at the forefront of Roman thinking. This image of him creates a further appearance of being an important mediator between the people of Rome and the gods. Coinage Coinage was probably the most effective tool of propaganda available to Augustus as certain types of it were used over the entire empire. To a certain degree, the coins used would have been commissioned by Augustus. If he had not approved of them they would have been decommissioned and few would have been found today. Due to the public nature of these coins we can assume that this was the official line that Augustus would have wanted to take as regards to his image so we can therefore rely on them to quite a large extent as accurate sources. There are many examples of Augustus being linked to divinities on coins so I will talk about a few examples. After the battle of Actium, with Egypt defeated, Augustus was shown on a coin with many features generally attributed to Neptune: He is seen holding the aplustre of Neptune and he has his foot on a globe. This suggests Augustus' idea that Rome is dominating the world, especially after the defeat of Egypt. This image in turn can be closely linked to that of Demetrius' Poseidon, holding a trident with his foot on a rock, which was moulded on the Greco-Roman sculpture at Lysippis, made to celebrate Demetrius' sea victory over Ptolemy of Egypt. The fact that he is holding the aplustre can only be seen as him assimilating himself to the god Neptune, not actually being the god, as he doesn't have a beard and he is holding a sword not a trident. This would have been carefully arranged so as not to anger the people who would have been looking out for signs that he was assuming too much power over them. This would have been an especially sensitive issue since one of the great atrocities of Antony and Cleopatra was that they were reported to have dressed up as gods themselves. On many other coins Augustus is seen with a strong resemblance to Apollo, who was his patron divinity. This could have been done to stress the family line descending from Apollo through familial resemblance9. Raaflaub, K.A & Toher, M. Between Republic and Empire Interpretations of Augustus and his Empire, Ch 5/8 Augustus keenly pushed the fact that his adoptive father, Caesar, was deified after death. This of course made him the son of a god, in addition to the fact that he could trace his family back to Apollo. This was publicised on many coins with the inscription 'CAESAR DIVI F' basically saying that he was the son of Caesar and therefore son of a Aenead was written during Augustus' lifetime by Virgil. It is not known whether it was actually commissioned by Augustus or whether it was written by Virgil as a way of flattering the emperor. However, it would have been very well known and served to document the beginnings or Rome and how it was prophesised from the beginning that Augustus would be the saviour of Rome. It draws many parallels between the lives of Aeneas and Augustus and there are points in the book where the gods talk about the future and what will happen to Rome if Aeneas perseveres and fulfils the prophecy of Rome. The book presents Augustus as a man-god by stressing his divine ancestry and also by indicating that the gods have been expecting him all along, making him extremely important and divinely blessed. The idea of it being prophesised all along is further backed up by the Sibylline books which were held by the Priestesses of Vesta and told the prophesies of Rome, including the prophecy of Augustus as the saviour. ConclusionIt was very important for Augustus to be presented as somewhere between man and god in order for him to maintain absolute control over the Empire. He managed to revive the religious order with himself right in the middle; the people of Rome could not miss him. It was prophesised that he would be their saviour and with his victories over the 'barbarians' from Egypt and general military successes bringing peace to Rome it would have seemed almost impossible that he didn't have some kind of divine blessing. All Augustus had to do was carefully exploit all this by extensive use of propaganda such as sculpture and coinage, to achieve ultimate control.""","""Augustus's religious propaganda in Rome""","2323","""Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome, wielded power not only through military might and political acumen but also through skillful manipulation of religious propaganda. His reign marked a pivotal shift in the religious landscape of Rome, where he utilized various strategies to solidify his authority and enhance his image as a divinely appointed ruler. Augustus capitalized on existing religious beliefs and institutions while introducing new cults and rituals to unify the empire under his leadership. This essay explores Augustus's religious propaganda in Rome, its impact on society, and the enduring legacy it left behind.  One of Augustus's key strategies was linking his rule with the concept of piety and religious devotion. He portrayed himself as a restorer of traditional Roman values and morals, emphasizing a return to the perceived glory of the Republic's early days. By aligning himself with the virtuous qualities associated with the Roman gods, Augustus sought to present himself as a pious and benevolent ruler, chosen by the divine forces to bring peace and prosperity to the empire. This association with religious virtues helped Augustus garner support from the Roman populace, who viewed him as a figure who could bring stability and order after years of civil war.  To reinforce his divine mandate, Augustus engaged in a deliberate program of religious revival and reform. He revived ancient religious ceremonies, rebuilt temples, and promoted the worship of traditional Roman gods. Augustan propaganda emphasized his role as the Pontifex Maximus, the chief priest of Rome, highlighting his connection to the sacred and his authority over religious matters. By restoring and upholding religious traditions, Augustus aimed to present himself as a guardian of Rome's spiritual heritage, portraying his reign as a period of divine favor and moral renewal.  In addition to reinforcing existing religious practices, Augustus introduced new cults and rituals that promoted loyalty to the imperial system. The cult of Divus Julius, established to honor his adoptive father, Julius Caesar, served to connect Augustus's rule with the revered memory of the deified Caesar. By emphasizing his familial ties to the divine, Augustus sought to legitimize his position as Caesar's rightful heir and perpetuate the idea of a dynastic succession. The construction of the Temple of Divus Julius in the Roman Forum further solidified this cult's importance in propagating the notion of imperial continuity and divine approval.  Augustus also encouraged the worship of Roma et Augustus, a cult that venerated both the personification of Rome as a goddess and himself as a divinely sanctioned ruler. This syncretic cult blended traditional Roman religious beliefs with the cult of the emperor, promoting the idea of a symbiotic relationship between Augustus, Rome, and the empire. By associating himself with the personification of Rome, Augustus projected an image of himself as the embodiment of Rome's greatness and the protector of its interests. The cult of Roma et Augustus reinforced the idea of Augustus as a unifying force within the empire, symbolizing the cohesion of diverse provinces under Roman rule.  Another significant aspect of Augustus's religious propaganda was the promotion of his own deification during his lifetime. Augustus carefully crafted his public image to foster the perception of his divine nature and immortal status. Coins, statues, and monuments depicted Augustus in the guise of a god, often with attributes of deities such as Jupiter or Apollo. This visual language reinforced the idea of Augustus as a quasi-divine figure, elevated above mortal rulers through his association with the divine realm. The mythologization of Augustus served to exalt his authority and ensure his legacy as a revered and everlasting presence in the Roman psyche.  The implementation of Augustus's religious propaganda had far-reaching implications for Roman society. By intertwining religious ideology with imperial power, Augustus established a framework for subsequent emperors to legitimize their rule through divine endorsement. The cult of the emperor, propagated by Augustus, became a central feature of imperial ideology, shaping the relationship between the ruler and his subjects for centuries to come. The fusion of religious and political authority under Augustus set a precedent for the imperial cult that would endure throughout the Roman Empire, reinforcing the notion of the emperor as a living god and the embodiment of Rome's collective identity.  The legacy of Augustus's religious propaganda extended beyond his lifetime, leaving an indelible mark on Roman culture and religious practices. The imperial cult, with its emphasis on the divinity of the emperor, persisted as a potent symbol of Roman unity and power. Subsequent emperors, such as Caligula and Domitian, exploited this cult to enhance their authority and assert their status as divine rulers. The enduring tradition of emperor worship, rooted in Augustus's religious propaganda, played a significant role in shaping the imperial cult as a central pillar of Roman state religion.  In conclusion, Augustus's religious propaganda in Rome was a multifaceted tool used to consolidate his power, legitimize his rule, and shape the religious fabric of the Roman Empire. Through a combination of traditional religious revival, innovative cult promotion, and personal deification, Augustus crafted an image of himself as a divinely sanctioned leader, embodying the virtues and authority of the Roman gods. His strategic blending of religious symbolism with imperial ideology set the stage for the development of the imperial cult and laid the foundation for centuries of dynastic rule in Rome. Augustus's influence on Roman religion and politics reverberated throughout the empire, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to resonate in our understanding of ancient Rome's religious dynamics.""","1109"

In Part B, material and process were selected for column spacers under a varying compressive load. Finally, the structural section was selected for a beam in Assignment. Cambridge Engineering Selector was mainly used in those cases to select the best suitable results. In conclusion, 'Higher Conductivity Copper' was chosen for fresh-water heat exchanger tubes in Assignment Part A. Secondly, 'Silicon' was selected for column spacers and 'Fine created to identify a subset of materials that met the criteria. On the other hand, some other material characteristics which might influence the choice were also considered before a suitable material was chosen. The Specification for particular heat exchanger was given below: Maximum service temperature 5/80(which is equal to 23K)Elongation >0%Corrosion resistance in fresh water Very goodThermal conductivity As large as possibleMethod:First of all, a graphic stage was created by pressing the 'New graphic stage' button on the standard toolbar in the CES window, 'Fresh water' was selected from attributes list box on the x-axis tab and 'Ductility' was selected on the y-axis tab. A graph was shown to indicate the ductility of materials against the corrosion resistance in fresh water. 'Box selection' button on the Project toolbar was pressed afterwards for selecting materials within a property range. The mouse was clicked near the materials were hidden by pressing 'Hide failed record' box in 'Stage properties' window. Secondly, another graphic stage was created in the same method as the one above. But 'Maximum service temperature' and 'Thermal conductivity' were selected on the x-axis and y-axis tab respectively. A shown again to indicate the maximum service temperature against the thermal conductivity for different materials. Again, 'Box selection' button was pressed and limits were refined to 23K to the x-axis and refined to 00W/m.K to 22W/m. the y-axis, using the same method as stage one. At the end, 1 different materials met the specification in this stage. Finally, materials that superimposed were found out by pressing the 'Result intersection' toggle on the standard toolbar. Results could be viewed by clicking on 'Results Window' button, in this case there were 1 materials which met both specifications; a list of results was shown in Figure. A clearer view for stage and after intersection were shown in Figure. and. respectively. Evaluation:In fact some characteristics were also important and might influence the choice, therefore a careful consideration was needed, e.g. lower price was important in large number of manufacturing processes, higher endurance limit was helpful for long-term usage and the relevant replacement cost could be minimized, lower specific heat lowered the amount of heat required to heat up the fluid. Although 'Silver, Commercial Purity' (Figure.) was the best material after intersection, it was too expensive. Both 'Brass' (Figure.) and 'High Conductivity Copper' (Figure.) had a lower price and a similar specific heat, 'High Conductivity Copper' had a higher endurance limit and 'Higher Conductivity Copper' had a higher thermal conductivity. But the heat exchanger tubes with high thermal conductivity were more important than one with a high endurance limit. So in conclusion, 'Higher Conductivity Copper' was chosen for fresh-water heat exchanger tubes. PART B - Selection for column spacers under a varying compressive loadIntroduction:This part included selection for column spacers in a precision instrument. The instrument incorporated two stiff plates between which a fluid flowed. They were held apart by a set of seven spacers, which were to be solid bars of circular cross-section. Periodically changing compressive load was applied axially on the plates. Specification for the instrument:Spacers length.5/80.15/8 mmDiameter of plates 5/8 compressive load 0 price 0,00Number of selling each year 5/8Expected tooling cost 5/800-000Principal criteria for choice:Spacers should not fail under the load.Material should be essentially an electrical insulator.Thermal distortion should be as low as possible.Resistance to water and organic solvents should be very good and resistance to acids should be good.In theory, thermal distortion could be minimized by selecting materials with large values of the index M= /, where is thermal conductivity and is thermal expansion. Methods:For material selection, 'Materials' was selected in project setting window. Actually created for selection of materials. A limit stage was created in stage one and the environmental resistance were adjusted to 'Very good' for 'Fresh Water' and 'Organic Solvents', and 'Good' for 'Weak Acid' (Figure.). Total number of 007 different materials met the specification in this stage. Secondly, a graphical stage was created in stage, 'Compressive Strength' and 'Resistivity' were selected on x and y-axis respectively. Formula =F/A was used to find out the maximum compressive strength, where was compressive strength, F was compressive load applied and A was cross sectional area. In this case, =./ MPa, which was equal to 2.906MPa. 'Box selection' button was pressed and limits were refined to 2.906MPa to the x-axis and refined to 0010 - ohm.m the y-axis. At the end, 66 different materials met the specification in this indicated by clicking once on a point above line with hand cursor. There are total number of 5/83 materials met the specification in stage.15/8mm on the 'Selection' 'Germanium' (Figure.2) had a outstanding good result, but the compressive strength and thermal distortion of 'Silicon' was slightly higher and lower respectively than 'Germanium', also the price of 'Silicon' is much lower than 'Germanium'. Therefore, 'Silicon' was chosen to manufacture the spacers. On the other hand, 'Fine ' selected for 'Machining' and 'Finishing' process respectively. A better precision and surface finish of spacers could be obtained using the 'Fine = load in N/m, L = length and EI = flexural stiffness.In this case, max = / (84EI) Method:First of all, 'Shape' was selected in selection table after opening the 'Project Setting' window form 'Project' menu.

Hollow-(945/8.)' was chosen for the beam because a high torsional stiffness and a low price could be found from this section.""","""Material selection for engineering applications""","1606","""Material selection is a critical aspect of engineering that impacts the performance, durability, and overall success of a design. Engineers must carefully consider a variety of factors when choosing materials for specific applications to ensure optimal results. From mechanical properties to environmental conditions, each consideration plays a crucial role in determining the most suitable material for the job.  One of the primary considerations in material selection is the mechanical properties of the material. These properties include strength, stiffness, hardness, and toughness, all of which are essential for determining how a material will perform under different loading conditions. Engineers must assess the required mechanical properties based on the forces and stresses the material will experience during its intended use. For example, high-strength materials like steel are suitable for applications that require withstanding heavy loads, while materials with high toughness may be preferred for impact-resistant products.  Another crucial factor in material selection is the thermal properties of the material. Thermal conductivity, expansion coefficient, and specific heat capacity are essential considerations in applications where temperature variations are significant. For instance, in aerospace engineering, materials with low thermal conductivity and high heat resistance are preferred to withstand extreme temperatures during atmospheric re-entry or space travel. Understanding how a material responds to heat is vital to prevent thermal expansion issues or structural failures due to temperature changes.  Corrosion resistance is a key consideration in material selection for applications exposed to harsh environments or corrosive substances. Materials like stainless steel or corrosion-resistant alloys are commonly used in industries such as chemical processing, marine engineering, and offshore structures where exposure to moisture, chemicals, or salt can lead to premature degradation. Choosing a material with excellent corrosion resistance can significantly extend the lifespan of a product and reduce maintenance costs over time.  Environmental factors must also be taken into account when selecting materials for engineering applications. Exposure to UV radiation, moisture, humidity, or chemicals can degrade certain materials over time, leading to performance issues or structural failures. Weathering tests and accelerated aging studies can help engineers determine the durability of materials under specific environmental conditions and select the most suitable material for long-term use.  Cost considerations play a significant role in material selection, especially in large-scale production or consumer products where manufacturing costs directly impact the final product's price. Engineers must balance performance requirements with material costs to optimize the overall design for efficiency and affordability. Material availability, processing costs, and maintenance expenses should all be considered to ensure that the chosen material aligns with budget constraints without compromising quality or performance.  The manufacturing process and formability of a material are essential factors to consider, especially in applications that require complex shapes or intricate designs. Some materials are easier to machine, weld, or mold than others, affecting the overall manufacturing efficiency and production time. Engineers must evaluate the ease of processing and forming a material to determine its compatibility with the chosen manufacturing method and design requirements.  Compatibility with other materials or components is crucial in multi-material assemblies or systems where different materials must work together seamlessly. Engineers must consider factors such as galvanic corrosion, thermal expansion coefficients, and material interactions to prevent compatibility issues that can compromise the integrity and performance of the overall system. Selecting materials that are compatible with each other can prevent premature failures and ensure the longevity of the product or structure.  Innovations in materials science have led to the development of advanced materials with unique properties that cater to specific engineering applications. Materials like composites, shape memory alloys, and nanomaterials offer enhanced performance characteristics such as high strength-to-weight ratios, self-healing properties, and superior electrical conductivity. By leveraging these cutting-edge materials, engineers can push the boundaries of traditional design limitations and create innovative solutions for complex challenges.  Life cycle assessments (LCAs) are increasingly being used to evaluate the environmental impacts of materials throughout their entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal or recycling. Sustainable materials with low environmental footprints are gaining prominence in engineering applications as companies strive to reduce their carbon footprint and promote eco-friendly practices. Engineers must consider not only the performance and cost of materials but also their environmental impact to make informed decisions that support sustainability goals.  In conclusion, material selection in engineering applications is a multifaceted process that involves careful consideration of mechanical properties, thermal characteristics, corrosion resistance, environmental factors, cost constraints, manufacturing processes, compatibility, and sustainability. By evaluating these factors holistically and prioritizing the requirements of each specific application, engineers can choose the most suitable materials to achieve optimal performance, durability, and efficiency in their designs. Continuous advancements in materials science and a growing emphasis on sustainability are driving innovation in material selection, paving the way for more resilient, eco-friendly, and versatile engineering solutions across various industries.""","920"
"3033","""During a recent mental health placement, I worked with several service users with dual diagnosis: a mental health problem with comorbid substance substance misuse agencies, in four urban UK centres. The researchers found that 4% of service users in CMHTs had a past-year substance misuse problem, while 5/8% of drug service and 5/8% of alcohol service users had a past-year psychiatric disorder. The results from these inner-city areas may not be representative of all UK urban centres. However, high prevalence of dual diagnosis amongst mental health service users has previously been evidenced in both UK US poor outcomes in substance misuse treatment programmes (Carey et al. cited in Weaveral. 003). Despite widespread recognition of the significance of these problems, there remains much debate over the most effective means of addressing them. The leading recommendation for intervention stems from American research and advocates the use of integrated treatment programmes: whereby substance misuse and psychiatric treatment are provided together by a single team (Drakeal. 001). Integrated programmes are considered superior to serial programmes, where one treatment follows another, and parallel programmes, where treatments are simultaneous but provided by separate teams (Leyal. 000; Tyrer & Weaver 004). Dr R. E. Drake, a principal supporter of the integrated approach, has been involved in several research studies and the development of integrated treatment models in New Hampshire (USA). In a literature review, Drakeal. assert that integrated programmes can now be considered evidence-based, and that effective components include; a long-term perspective, comprehensiveness, cultural sensitivity, staged interventions, assertive outreach, motivational interventions, counselling/cognitive behavioural therapy and social support. Although Drakeal. acknowledge inconsistencies in the quality of the research to which they refer, the concept of the integrated approach has become highly influential (Tyrer & Weaver 004). However, other researchers dispute the evidence for integrated programmes (Leyal. 000; Tyrer & Weaver 004). In a review for the Cochrane Collaboration, Leyal. examined six US randomised controlled trials comparing interventions for dual diagnosis, and found that no evidence for the superiority of integrated programmes over standard care could be established. Two service innovations in the UK, both aiming to provide integrated services have also been studied. Bayneyal. describe the work of MIDAS, a specialist team set up exclusively for dual diagnosis service users in West Hertfordshire. This multidisciplinary team offer a wide range of treatments and employ an assertive outreach approach, similar to models tested in the US. Bayneyal. studied the case files of the first 0 clients accepted. Grahamal. similarly describe the COMPASS Programme in North Birmingham: a specialist team set up to provide expertise and training in dual diagnosis to existing mental health and substance misuse services. This service model has been tailored to fit existing service structures in the UK. However, both of these services were in their infancy at the time of writing, and consequently both sets of researchers conclude that ongoing evaluation of these integrated programmes is required. In choosing articles to examine in more depth, I was interested in pursuing the debate regarding integrated programmes, however I also wished to reflect a range of research methodology. I have therefore selected, the only randomised control trial of integrated programmes to have been completed in the UK, an observational US study that reflects the influence of the integrated concept, and the only qualitative research I encountered on this subject. Barrowcloughal. employed a randomised, controlled, single-blind clinical trial, to investigate the benefits of an integrated psychosocial intervention programme for service users with comorbid schizophrenia and substance misuse. The control group received routine psychiatric care, while the experimental group received an integrated programme of motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioural therapy and family/caregiver intervention in addition to routine psychiatric care. Preliminary deskwork involved ensuring all potential participants met the same criteria pertaining to their psychotic disorder, substance misuse, age, contact with mental health services, amount of contact with caregivers and lack of organic brain disease, other medical illness or learning disability. Diagnoses were established through chart review and discussion. Once individuals were deemed eligible for the study, their written informed consent was sought before seeking the written consent of the caregiver. Service user-caregiver dyads were then stratified and randomly assigned, to ensure equal male-female distribution and substance use representation in both groups. Fieldwork involved measuring outcomes through quantitative interviews and observation to translate into statistical data; the independent assessors were blind to treatment allocation. Outcome measures were; general functioning, positive symptoms, exacerbation of symptoms, number of days abstinence from non-prescribed substances and number of relapses. The assessors used established scales to measure each outcome at baseline, and then every three months until one year after the start of the programme. The results demonstrated significant improvement in general functioning, and improvements in the other outcome measures in the experimental group. This study reflects the positivist paradigm, which aims to emulate research procedures used in the natural sciences (Blaxteral. 004). The methods are quantitative, experimental and statistical with the objective of predicting the most effective treatment programme for this group of service-users. The study appears methodologically sound: the control and experimental groups were carefully matched; the demographic characteristics of participants correspond to profiles of this service user group in previous studies, ethical considerations are addressed and extensive information is given throughout so that it could be replicated. Limitations have also been cited for example, the sample size of 6, which limits the generalisability. The researchers also acknowledge that since the percentage of dual diagnosis service users who have contact with family/caregiver is unknown, this sample may not be representative of the wider population, since it only included users who had a minimum of ten hours of contact each week. There are additional limitations, however, which have not been identified. Firstly, this experiment could only assess interventions with individuals engaging with services: a characteristic unrepresentative of this population (DH 999): 5/8% invited to participate in the study refused. This raises uncertainty over how representative this sample was, and how useful longitudinal studies are with this population. Secondly, although a psychosocial programme was employed, the outcome measures were primarily medical, reflecting a medical model of improvement. These measures do not necessarily concur with the service user's view of improvements in quality of life. Thirdly this study only relates to service users with Schizophrenia and may not be generalisable to service users with other diagnoses. Despite the researchers' conclusion that integrated care correlates to improved outcomes, they recognise that causality of outcomes remains ambiguous. Hensley's observational study, aimed to evaluate integrated treatment outcomes for a small sample of 1 dual diagnosis participants, based at a mental health agency in St. Louis (USA). This was a quantitative, retrospective study, using secondary data contained in the agency's database and medical charts. The sample had participated in at least one year of psychiatric treatment at the centre, before enrolling in the integrated dual diagnosis programme. Outcome measurements taken after 2 months on the integrated programme were compared with the baseline measurements taken at the time of enrolment. In analysing the outcomes data, paired samples t-tests were performed and a p-value given to indicate whether the difference between outcomes was statistically significant. Hensley found that three of the six outcome measures had statistical significance: general functioning (increase), substance abuse/dual hospitalisations (decrease), and homelessness (decrease). The conclusion was that participation in this integrated treatment programme was associated with some positive change in life outcomes. Although the paradigm appears to be positivist, Hensley is not objective but acknowledges that she is an employee of the organisation she is researching. In addition she introduces her study from the premise that integrated programmes are more effective than alternative models, citing a review undertaken by the supporters of the integrated approach, Drakeal. No references are made to literature suggesting the opposite conclusion e.g. the Cochrane review by Leyal. 000. While the analysis of the statistical data appears clear and impartial, the conclusions drawn from these results are illogical, and the outcome measures are flawed. The outcome of homelessness decreased significantly from 3% at baseline, to % after 2 months of the integrated programme. However, this measurement may be misleading, as it only represents two points in time. Since the service user group is characteristically peripatetic (DH 999), a more valid outcome measure could have been the number of times participants had become homeless and been re-accommodated in both 2-month periods. The outcome of substance abuse/dual hospitalisation was hypothesised to increase following the integrated programme, due to respondents' increased readiness to change and receive rehabilitation treatments. However, when this outcome was shown to decrease, a positive interpretation was still given: that clients no longer needed to escape their situation by seeking admission. Since neither interpretation was verified, this outcome should not be assumed an indication of positive change: the fact that Hensley does so may be an indication of bias towards the integrated model. Considering these factors, the only outcome that indicates positive change is the increase in general functioning. Hensley recognises the sample size as a limitation to generalisability and asserts that there is only an association, not a causal link, between the integrated programme and positive life changes. However, she does not consider alternative theories, such as improvements being the result of receiving two years of treatment, rather than 2 months of the integrated programme. The validity of this study may have been compromised by the researcher's assumption, based on the disputed evidence of past studies, that integrated programmes are superior and interprets some of her findings to fit this hypothesis. This demonstrates the impact that assumptions can have on research findings and the potential for research to construct a social reality rather than reflect it (May cited in Blaxter 004). 'Blamed and Ashamed' is a two-year qualitative survey, documenting the experiences of youth with dual diagnosis and their families, across nine American states (FFCMH 001). The aim of the research was to offer respondents an opportunity to voice their experiences and formulate recommendations for professionals and policy makers to improve services. In this sense the study reflects a critical social paradigm, as it seeks to reveal underlying conflict and oppression and bring about positive change (Blaxteral. 001). The study was overseen by two family-run organisations, that trained and supported a team of youth researchers, themselves dual diagnosis service users, to carry out the research in focus groups. An independent specialist in participatory evaluation assisted the youth researchers in designing structured interview questions, and provided training in interview and focus group techniques. Advocacy organisations in each state identified participants, convening 5/8 focus groups of ten participants: of these were parent groups. Each group represented a cross-section of ethnicity and socio-economic status, and the youth ranged from 3-8 years old. The focus group sessions were audio taped and transcribed by the specialist researcher, the youth and adult responses were compiled separately. The youth team felt strongly that the data should not be analysed by an independent person removed from the experience of dual diagnosis, consequently a group of experienced adults and youth met to analyse the data and identify key themes. Too many themes and recommendations were identified to discuss here, however overall the participants reported that they had felt blamed and shamed by service providers and called for increased respect and involvement in planning services. With regards to integrated treatment models, the respondents felt that holistic, comprehensive and integrated programmes were the only effective approach. Although ethical considerations should be addressed in every research study, participatory approaches and focus groups present researchers with particular challenges. The report details the ethical training and confidentiality procedures the youth researchers were given: including gaining written consent, informing participants how the data would be used and having participants sign confidentiality forms. Although responses were anonymised in the data, sharing sensitive information within the focus groups still carried a psychological risk to the participants and youth researcher. The study acknowledges this risk but emphasises the advantages to this approach: empowering both the participants by giving them a voice, and the youth researchers by giving them a sense of ownership of the study. Although the empowerment may have been beneficial, it is unclear whether any follow-up support was offered to the youth and parents. Follow-up could have ameliorated any negative effects of the process, which may have impinged upon the youths' mental health. The sensitive nature of the information may also have affected the reliability of the data analysis. The group selected for this process had personal experience of dual diagnosis, and the report records how this group acknowledged their strong emotions associated with the subject. Therefore, the subjective views of the data analysts might have influenced the selection of the key themes from the data. Despite the research that points to the high prevalence of dual diagnosis and its association with a range of adverse outcomes, the evidence base for interventions is currently limited and inconclusive. While Barrowcloughal. demonstrate a correlation between integrated programmes and improved outcomes, these results may only be generalisable to service users with family/caregiver contact and a diagnosis of Schizophrenia. Hensley's study also suggests an association with integrated programmes and significant improvement in general functioning, however the quality of the methodology undermines her conclusion. While the qualitative survey provides a valuable insight into the service user and carer perspective, this study is limited to the youth population and may not be generalisable to the UK. A number of the limitations identified in the research, reflect the complexity of researching this area. The diverse population, representing a range of mental health diagnoses and different types of substance misuse, limits the generalisability of studies. In addition, each study suggesting a positive association between integrated treatment and improved outcomes uses a different combination of interventions, adding to the variables. This prevents studies from being directly comparable and reduces the evidence base for discrete interventions. Moreover, the difficulty of engaging this population with services may be reflected in the sample selection process, so that samples successfully engaged in research programmes may be unrepresentative of the wider population. Further limitations of the current body of knowledge (from a UK perspective), is that the majority is American and may be ungeneralisable. It is also unknown how many of these studies may have been influenced by the growing support for the integrated model. The apparent monopoly of psychiatry over this subject also narrows the evidence base, as the methodology used is scientific, quantitative and of a positivist paradigm. Although these studies are of value, a range of different research methods is more likely to produce a better overall picture of the effectiveness of interventions (Parry 996). Finally, the majority of outcomes in this research have hitherto centred on medical measures of improvement, which may not reflect the service user and carer perspective and experience. A research project that enabled service users and carers to set the outcome measures, may demonstrate alternative priorities and produce different results. All of these methods are currently needed in the UK to build a robust evidence base for interventions. However, qualitative research could be used to explore the service users' assessment of interventions, and to identify any barriers in service provision that exclude dual diagnosis service users or hinder positive change.""","""Dual diagnosis and integrated treatment.""","3076","""Dual diagnosis, also known as co-occurring disorders, refers to the simultaneous presence of a mental health disorder and a substance abuse disorder in an individual. This complex and challenging condition requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to treatment to ensure the best possible outcomes for those affected. Integrated treatment is a holistic method that addresses both the mental health and substance abuse aspects concurrently, recognizing the interconnected nature of these disorders. By combining therapy, medication, social support, and other interventions tailored to the individual's specific needs, integrated treatment aims to promote lasting recovery and improved overall well-being.  Individuals with dual diagnosis face unique challenges that require specialized care. Mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia can often coexist with substance abuse issues like alcohol or drug addiction. The relationship between these disorders is bidirectional, meaning that the symptoms of one can exacerbate the other, leading to a vicious cycle of worsening conditions. For example, someone with depression may turn to substances to self-medicate and cope with their emotional pain, which can then lead to addiction and further deterioration of their mental health.  Treating each disorder separately can be ineffective or even counterproductive in cases of dual diagnosis. Integrated treatment recognizes the intricate interplay between mental health and substance abuse issues and provides a more holistic and interconnected approach to address both simultaneously. This comprehensive method is essential for breaking the cycle of dual diagnosis and promoting long-term recovery and wellness.  Integrated treatment typically involves a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals working collaboratively to address the various needs of individuals with dual diagnosis. This team may include psychiatrists, psychologists, substance abuse counselors, social workers, nurses, and other experts who specialize in mental health and addiction treatment. By combining their expertise and perspectives, these professionals can create a personalized treatment plan that considers both the mental health and substance abuse aspects of the individual's condition.  One of the key components of integrated treatment is dual-focus therapy, which integrates strategies from both mental health and substance abuse treatment modalities. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), motivational interviewing, and trauma-focused therapies are among the approaches commonly used in dual diagnosis treatment. These therapies help individuals develop coping skills, improve emotional regulation, manage cravings, address underlying trauma, and enhance relapse prevention strategies.  Medication management is another crucial aspect of integrated treatment for dual diagnosis. Psychiatric medications may be prescribed to address symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, or psychosis. Additionally, medications for substance use disorders, such as methadone or buprenorphine for opioid addiction, can help individuals reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, supporting their recovery journey. Coordinating medication regimens carefully and monitoring potential interactions is essential to ensure the safety and effectiveness of treatment.  In addition to therapy and medication, social support plays a significant role in integrated treatment for dual diagnosis. Peer support groups, family therapy, and community resources can provide individuals with a supportive network that fosters recovery and encourages healthy lifestyle changes. Building strong social connections and addressing issues related to relationships, housing, employment, and legal matters are essential components of holistic treatment for dual diagnosis.  Furthermore, lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, balanced nutrition, adequate sleep, and stress management techniques are integral parts of integrated treatment. These holistic approaches help improve overall well-being, enhance mood stability, and reduce the risk of relapse. Engaging in activities that promote physical and emotional health can empower individuals to take charge of their recovery and build a foundation for long-lasting wellness.  The effectiveness of integrated treatment for dual diagnosis is supported by research evidence demonstrating positive outcomes for individuals receiving this comprehensive approach. Studies have shown that integrated treatment leads to reduced substance use, improved mental health symptoms, decreased hospitalizations, and enhanced overall quality of life. By addressing the underlying issues contributing to both mental health and substance abuse disorders, integrated treatment can break the cycle of dual diagnosis and pave the way for sustainable recovery and recovery.  However, despite the benefits of integrated treatment, several challenges exist in implementing this approach effectively. One significant barrier is the fragmentation of the healthcare system, where mental health and substance abuse services are often provided separately with limited communication and coordination between providers. This lack of integration can result in gaps in care, duplication of services, and inadequate treatment for individuals with dual diagnosis.  Another challenge is the stigma associated with mental health and substance abuse disorders, which can hinder individuals from seeking help and accessing integrated treatment. Fear of judgment, discrimination, or confidentiality breaches may prevent people from disclosing their struggles and receiving the support they need. Addressing stigma through education, advocacy, and destigmatization efforts is crucial to creating a supportive environment that promotes effective integrated treatment for dual diagnosis.  Moreover, the complexity of dual diagnosis cases, with multiple and overlapping symptoms, can pose challenges in diagnosis and treatment planning. Identifying the primary disorder, assessing the severity of each condition, and tailoring interventions to meet the individual's specific needs require thorough evaluation and expertise. Comprehensive assessment tools, collaboration among healthcare providers, and ongoing monitoring and adjustment of treatment are essential to address the complexities of dual diagnosis effectively.  To overcome these challenges and enhance the delivery of integrated treatment for dual diagnosis, several strategies can be implemented. Integrated care models that combine mental health and substance abuse services within a unified treatment approach have shown promising results in improving outcomes for individuals with co-occurring disorders. These models emphasize shared decision-making, continuity of care, and comprehensive treatment planning to ensure a seamless and coordinated approach to dual diagnosis treatment.  Furthermore, training healthcare providers in the principles of integrated treatment and dual diagnosis management is critical to enhancing the quality of care delivery. Professional development programs, continuing education initiatives, and interdisciplinary collaborations can help build the knowledge and skills necessary to address the complex needs of individuals with dual diagnosis effectively. By fostering a culture of collaboration, communication, and compassion among healthcare professionals, integrated treatment can become more widely available and accessible to those in need.  In conclusion, dual diagnosis presents a significant challenge that requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to treatment. Integrated treatment addresses the interconnected nature of mental health and substance abuse disorders, offering a holistic and personalized approach to healing and recovery. By combining therapy, medication, social support, and lifestyle modifications, integrated treatment aims to break the cycle of dual diagnosis and empower individuals to achieve lasting wellness. Overcoming barriers, addressing stigma, and enhancing healthcare provider training are essential steps in promoting effective integrated treatment for dual diagnosis and improving outcomes for those affected by this complex condition. By recognizing the complexities of dual diagnosis and embracing a holistic and collaborative approach to treatment, we can support individuals on their journey toward recovery and well-being.""","1325"
"6156","""The results of a 006 Food Frequency Questionnaire, filled out by 6 eager first years at, show remarkably modest levels of alcohol consumption. This Questionnaire was part of a Dietary Survey used to establish the nutritional components of these students' diet over the previous days. The results showed that all 6 subjects - 3 males and 3 females - had relatively well-proportioned, nutrient-rich diets with few significant deviations. Yet surprisingly it also revealed that they had an average alcohol consumption of only 7.g per day. Based on Government figures this converts to units per day - equivalent to a pint of ordinary strength larger such as Fosters. This would probably shock most of us as few would suspect that drinking more than one Fosters would be classed as 'going on a binge'. Binge or no binge, drinking is still thought to be a major part of a students' life. Yet, according to these recent figures, female students at consume on average units a night and males only - both a unit below the national maximum recommendations. You would only need to go out once with a student to see that this level of alcohol consumption is grossly under-par. So what does it mean? Are students truly as angelic as the figures imply? The truth is that there are many major inaccuracies associated with questionnaires such as these. Food frequency questionnaires are no exception. They are suitable for large-scale surveys and can focus on specific nutrients in the diet, yet they often have over-estimation of nutrients and under-estimation of unhealthy foods. Whether they are accurate or not these students still show alcohol consumption levels below the maximum recommended amount. Yet, compared with a 003 National Diet and Nutrition then. This increase in alcohol consumption requires an increase in nutrient intake. This is due to alcohol's 'empty calories' - energy without nutrients. But are 's students doing this? Alcohol, as well as not giving any nutrients, also takes them away. God's gift to hangovers, Vitamin it in males. RNIs are part of the government's Dietary Reference Vitamin all well above the RNIs. However the questionnaire also picked up on Potassium and Iron would no doubt hamper the body in combating the effects of alcohol. A new area of research is investigating the effectiveness of Phosphorus in treating alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Funnily enough students have abnormally high levels of Phosphorus in their diet. All subjects have more than double the RNI and males are even over the safe upper limit! Could there be a hidden message behind this strange discovery? Whether Students are in fact recovering alcoholics or just misunderstood youths remains to be seen. Nonetheless, students appear to be consuming more alcohol than the national means (for 003), while still managing to keep their units per day below the maximum recommended amount. This paradoxical set of results leaves us questioning their accuracy - which, with the national trends showing huge increases in alcohol consumption, would not be a bad thing to do! Published November""","""Student Alcohol Consumption and Diet""","607","""Student alcohol consumption and diet play crucial roles in shaping overall health and well-being during the college years. The lifestyle choices made in terms of alcohol consumption and diet can significantly impact academic performance, mental health, and physical well-being. It is essential for students to be mindful of their choices and make informed decisions to support their health.  Alcohol consumption among students is a widespread concern due to its potential negative effects. Excessive drinking can lead to impaired decision-making, risky behavior, and long-term health issues. Binge drinking, in particular, is prevalent on college campuses and can result in alcohol poisoning, accidents, and even fatalities. Students should be aware of the risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption and practice moderation to protect their health and safety.  In terms of diet, the college environment presents unique challenges for students. Busy schedules, limited resources, and peer influence can all contribute to poor dietary choices. Consuming a diet high in processed foods, sugary beverages, and fast food can lead to weight gain, nutrient deficiencies, and overall decreased health. It is important for students to prioritize a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein to support their academic performance and overall well-being.  Furthermore, the relationship between alcohol consumption and diet is significant. Alcohol contains empty calories and can disrupt the body's ability to metabolize nutrients effectively. Drinking excessively can lead to poor food choices, increased cravings for unhealthy foods, and disrupted eating patterns. Students who consume alcohol regularly should be mindful of their dietary habits to ensure that they are meeting their nutritional needs and supporting their health goals.  Practical tips for students to maintain a healthy balance include practicing moderation when consuming alcohol, staying hydrated, eating regular meals, and incorporating a variety of nutrient-dense foods into their diet. Developing healthy habits early on can set the foundation for a lifetime of well-being. Additionally, seeking support from campus resources such as counseling services, nutritionists, and health education programs can provide valuable guidance and assistance in making positive lifestyle choices.  In conclusion, student alcohol consumption and diet are interconnected aspects of health that require attention and consideration. By being mindful of their choices, setting healthy boundaries, and seeking support when needed, students can prioritize their well-being and academic success. It is important for educational institutions to promote a culture of health and wellness to support students in making informed decisions about alcohol consumption and diet.""","473"
"6143","""The Delian league, set up in 78 by the city states of the Aegean, was the first footsteps towards what became the Athenian empire. The cities joined with the express purpose of having the Athenian army and its great navy on there side. Considering at the time of the creation of the league the Great Kings army still remained in Ionia, camped but a few miles from cities on the coast of modern day Anatolia and still warranted a threat to security. The Athenians were 'begged' by the allies to assume the command of the league and in particular the navel Athenians not only provided there troops and navel ships, which numbered many, but also provided the vast experience and military expertise gained from the wars with the Persians and other barbarian states. No wonder then that within the fifth century the Delian league numbered up to 60 city states, Athens' empire offered protection and trade in the Aegean. After the great victory's at the battles of Salamis and Marathon the Greek fleet, made up of all the allied Greek states and commanded by Leotychides the Spartan, chased the Persians across the Aegean where at Mycale they eventually routed there fleet and a large army. They proceeded on up the coast towards the Hellespont, which had been there main aim, to destroy the Persian bridge that spanned the straights. When they reach the straights they found the bridge already destroyed, possible by a storm, and therefore the Spartans and most of the allies set sail for home. Athens however remained and set siege to Sestos eventually defeating the city and creating an Athenian colony on the main grain route out of the black sea. It was after this that the allies asked Athens to become the leader of the attack against Persia. It is worth remembering that Sparta declined the offer due to there on going unrest at home with the enslaved Messenia's. Also after the campaign of spring 78 lead by Pausanias, a Spartan navel commander, the allies mistrusted him and the Delian league was based on the sacred island of Delos where all tribute was collected and kept in the Treasury. It was also here that the members met to discuss, confer and make decisions about campaigns, the Athenians headed these synods and also protected the treasury with 0 man delegation, the Hellenotamiae. They saw themselves, and where seen as, leaders on an equal footing with the rest of the confederacy. They where leading as the strongest and most experienced of the members and the evidence of the synods shows that they made decisions via assembly and popular vote. 'At first the leaders of autonomous allies, who reached there decisions in synodoi. ' (Thuc..7.) The first assessor of the leagues tribute was granted to a man called Aristides, who had already got the name of 'The Just' from his working with allies ad Athenians alike. His calculations of each allies tribute, to be paid yearly, was done by assessing the land and income of each states and making a fair judgment of each states capability. He played a large role in the league and helped benefit the allies as much as Athens, so much so given the command of the fleet. 'Aristides' conduct as a General was noted among the allies.and so enabled him to take over supreme command by sea.' (Diodorus xi. 6.-7.) The very reason we have sources from the history of Hellas, Plutarch and Demosthenes,(Hornblower 984:5/8-6) stating he was a poor man when he finished this work shows he must have been 'just.' Demosthenes even says that he had to have a funeral paid by the state, although this is disputed. The confederacies first scalp was Eion on the Thracian coast, still very loyal to Persia and the city itself still had a Persian satrap, Boges, who Thucydides tells us throws his family and himself on a burning funeral pyre before the Greeks enter the city. After this assault, Thucydides also tells us, some of the fleet attack and enslave the Dolopians on the Island of Scyros. This act is in great benefit to the whole of the Aegean as the Dolopian race are pirates and raiders. This further frees the trade routes for all allies and we can surely assume they benefit from increased income. Cimon and his fleet continue to drive the Persians out of Thrace and the west coast of Ionia until in 69 Cimon's fleet attacks the Persian triremes in there own waters of the coast of Pamphylia and win a decisive victory from then on the Aegean is free of Persian ships and troops. ' and destroyed some of there territories and made others revolt and come over to the Greeks, so he made Asia from the Ionian coast to Pamphylia completely empty of Persian forces.' (Plutarch 2.) This aloud the Athenians to spread there political ideas as well keep up the military campaigns abroad. The spread of Democracy round the Aegean had already started, possibly even before Athens took the hegemony of the league, but Athenians instigates the development of more democratic states within the region. 'For the Athenians everywhere destroyed oligarchies.' (Aristotle politics. ) Erythrae for example, Athens draws up The Erythrae Decree which establishes a democracy there in around the year 5/83/. We see the same in Miletus, 5/80/9, and Colophon, 47/. Many authors suggest this was the culmination natural progression to better government and order, but it surly must be helped by the Athenians persuasive arguments and ad vice. The spread of democracy must of given Athens strong backing with the people of the states concerned. For the first time in there history the had power to change or at least try to change policy, yet again the Athenians and the spread of her empire has benefited her member states. However, we could easily say that there was a strong alter ire motive to spreading democracy around the empire. First of all to gain support of the mass' but it could be said that the Athenians were trying weaken there allies and there main leaders, to the extent that they cant fight back and through the shackles off. Fighting back is just what some states tried to do, normally before they had forced democracies. The case of Naxos can be held up as the first attempt at a split from, what was still then, the Delian league. After the great campaign years of the late 70s the sea of the Aegean, even before Eurymedon, were all but clear of Persian forces. Naxos, Thucydides tells us, left the league believing there was no real advantage in being part of it any longer. She was brought back into line by Athenian forces, most likely without full league approval. Although McGregor disagrees saying 'in the early years the synods were meeting and, probably, the Athenians were not solely responsible for the sentencing of the Naxians.'(pg 0) This must be doubted as the act seems more like a message to all members not just to Naxos. After Naxos we see revolts in Thasos, over gold mines, and in Hestiaea we see the Athenians 'uprooted all the Hestiaeans from their land and planted Athenian settlers.'(Plutarch Pericles 3.) This is where we start to see evidence of colonies and then cleruchies, set up to over see the territory of the empire. Cleruchies seem to be set up more to over see the area or city there seems little evidence for people being moved away on mass, but instead the must pay a tax or a rental. '. they sent out cleruchies chosen by lot from among the Athenians themselves. The Lesbians agreed to pay these men the sum of minae per annum for each holding, and then work the land themselves.' The Athenians, to protect there new empire, used a number of ideas to keep there colonies in check. Proxenoi, like modern day ambassadors but often citizens of the subject city, where put in place 'to give hospitality.represent them in court and to protect interests in general' (Davies 9) This proxenoi where very often protected by strict and harsh laws, which as evidence, suggests they and the Athenian empire had begun to be disliked. The judicial system as a whole was set up to defend Athenian rights and policy, such as all exile, death and civil rights cases. The Athenian defence is that people will get a fairer trial outside of the state, with a unbiased jury. It is most likely however that most people charged to that extreme where pro-Athenians or even delegates themselves. This system allows Athens to protects it interests in its colonies, and means more money comes into Athens when people must travel to take trial. The Empire also set up strategic garrisons to control unrests and portray a strong image to her subjected allies. The amount of these is unknown, Aristotle states that there where up to 0000 men 'maintained' by state main question is did the Athenians benefit there allies enough that what the took from them in tribute, freedom and land was justified. Both Moses Finley and Russell Meiggs suggest a 'Balanced Sheet' where by 'The presumed disadvantages to the allies or subjects of Athens are set against advantages that may have made up for the lose of political freedom.' (Harrison 005/8:6) When looking at this question we also have to try to take into account the general feeling of the time. The Greeks by many accounts where very proud peoples, especially it seems the Athenian and the Spartans, would these to enjoy and freely except the ties of a Empire? Why then do we does Meiggs and Finley propose that the other states were content within the 'balanced sheet' this is clearly debatable. We have no direct evidence from any of the allies other than revolts and some court cases. The Mytilene debate highlights to us that one powerful ally tried to leave the empire and failed, would weaker states try after? Sources do suggest the Athenians did not set out, after being made league leaders, to gain a large empire. In a Athenian speech at the meeting of the Peloponnesian league it is said ' not acquire this empire by violent means, but because unwilling to prosecute to its conclusion the war against the Persians,. Circumstances at first compelled us to develop are empire to its present extent.' They Athenian goes on to explain they expanded there empire in fear of Sparta and could not let the allies go free in case they joined with the Peloponnesian's. We will never really no when the turning point from league to empire actually was, and when Athens turned her back on a peaceful league to defend the whole of Greece. The moving of the league tribute made a big statement to the members, as did the subjugation of Naxos.""","""Athenian Empire and Delian League Dynamics""","2303","""The Athenian Empire and the Delian League represent two interconnected and transformative entities in ancient Greek history. The establishment and evolution of these alliances were influenced by numerous political, social, and economic factors, shaping the dynamics of power in the ancient world. Understanding the complexities of the Athenian Empire and the Delian League involves delving into their origins, the rise of Athenian hegemony, the transition from a defensive to an imperial league, and the eventual demise of Athenian dominance. Let's explore these aspects in detail to grasp the intricate dynamics of these significant historical entities.  The Delian League emerged in 478 BC as a means of safeguarding allied Greek city-states from Persian incursions following the Greco-Persian Wars. Initially based on the island of Delos, the league was a collective defense pact led by Athens, which assumed a prominent role due to its naval capabilities and strategic significance. Members contributed ships, troops, or monetary tributes to the common defense fund housed on the sacred island. The alliance aimed to thwart any Persian resurgence and maintain stability in the Aegean region under the guise of mutual protection.  As Athens grew in power and ambition, the Delian League underwent a significant transformation. The league's headquarters was moved from Delos to Athens in 454 BC, leading to a shift in its nature from a defensive coalition to an instrument of Athenian imperialism. Athens, under the leadership of statesmen like Pericles, utilized the league's resources to enhance its naval supremacy, expand its influence, and consolidate its control over member city-states. The once voluntary contributions to the common fund became mandatory tribute payments, often extracted through coercion or force.  The dynamics within the Athenian Empire and the Delian League were deeply intertwined. Athens wielded increasing authority over league members, dictating foreign policy, trade agreements, and internal governance. The Athenians established cleruchies in strategic locations, installed pro-Athenian oligarchies, and intervened in the affairs of member states to ensure compliance with Athenian interests. This power dynamic created resentment among some allies, leading to revolts and uprisings, such as the famous rebellion of the island of Thasos in 465 BC.  Despite internal dissent, the Athenian Empire continued to expand its reach and influence through military conquests, diplomatic maneuvering, and cultural imperialism. The Delian League's funds, originally intended for common defense, were diverted to finance grandiose building projects like the Parthenon, support Athenian theater and arts, and maintain a lavish lifestyle for the Athenian elite. This centralized power structure and Athenian dominance over the league members exemplified the evolving dynamics of hegemony and imperialism in the ancient world.  The peak of Athenian power and influence within the Delian League coincided with the Golden Age of Athens during the mid-5th century BC. Under Pericles' guidance, Athens experienced a flourishing of arts, literature, philosophy, and democracy. The empire's cultural achievements, exemplified by figures like Sophocles, Euripides, and Socrates, left a lasting imprint on Western civilization. However, this period of prosperity was not devoid of challenges and conflicts.  The outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC marked a turning point in the dynamics of the Athenian Empire and the Delian League. The conflict pitted Athens and its allies against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta, highlighting the inherent tensions and rivalries between the two Greek power blocs. The prolonged and devastating war strained Athenian resources, fractured its alliances, and exposed the vulnerabilities of its imperial ambitions.  The eventual defeat of Athens in 404 BC signaled the downfall of the Athenian Empire and the unraveling of the Delian League. Spartan victory brought about a restructuring of power dynamics in the Greek world, leading to a brief period of Spartan hegemony known as the Spartan Hegemony. The dismantling of the Athenian Empire and the dissolution of the Delian League marked the end of an era characterized by Athenian dominance and the emergence of new power players vying for control in the Greek city-states.  In conclusion, the Athenian Empire and the Delian League constituted pivotal chapters in ancient Greek history, illustrating the complexities of power dynamics, imperialism, and alliance politics in the ancient world. From their humble beginnings as a defensive league to the heights of Athenian hegemony and the eventual decline and fall of the empire, these entities reshaped the geopolitical landscape of the ancient Mediterranean. By examining their origins, evolution, and eventual demise, we gain insights into the intricate interplay of power, ambition, and conflict that defined the ancient Greek world.""","938"
"6147","""In order to ascertain when modern science was born, a comprehensive definition of the word 'science' is paramount. One such example can be found in the Oxford English Dictionary, characterizing modern science to be 'knowledge involving systematized observation, experiment, and induction'. Therefore, science can be viewed not as a series of discoveries, but rather as the system by which these may be achieved. Using the key points in this definition therefore, the title of 'first scientist' should be given to the person with earliest records of these practises. The new method can be seen in comparison to customary techniques of obtaining general knowledge at the time, and as a revolutionary way of thinking. The suggested beginning for science is during a period of advancement in a broad range of fields, termed the 'Renaissance' by French historian Jules Michelet and meaning 'rebirth'. This progress, made through approximately the 4 th to 6 th centuries in Europe, was significant in arts, architecture and, most importantly to this discussion, technology. Galileo born in Italy towards the end of the Renaissance era and became credited with such significant contributions to the field of science that he has become a candidate for the prestigious title of 'first scientist'. Such a notable claim however is most definitely controversial, with debate as to whether Galileo's work warrants such an accolade. Therefore when attempting to answer the question under consideration a variety of perspectives need to be considered in order to reach a balanced conclusion. Prior to the 4 th-6 th centuries surge in understanding, the established wisdom concerning the nature of the world which was being taught in universities and given to the public was largely based on the writings of Aristotle; a Greek philosopher who lived between 84 and 23 BC whose teachings on an expansive range of theoretical philosophy had been maintained since then. This certainly would not be deemed even remotely 'scientific' adhering with views expressed in A Short History of Science to the Nineteenth Century stating that ' no body of doctrine which is not growing, which is not actually being made, can no longer retain the attributes of science'. The Western European society of the early 4 th Century had lost much of its earlier knowledge due to lack of up to date written history in the Middle Ages. This hindered progression during the period, with no scope for building on the work pre-established by others. It is easy to imagine then that the great structures such as the Colosseam and the Pantheon in Rome could seem intimidating to those whose understanding of how to construct anything of the like had been long buried. Consequently, much of the esteemed knowledge had been unchanged since the great days of Ancient Greece, and the inferiority of the people caused them to 'accept the teaching of ancient philosophers such as Aristotle and Euclid as a kind of Holy Writ'. The key point to be noted here is that expertise on the ways of the world was not discovered by the modern method of observance, instead it was provided from the conjecture of great minds. Theories were founded on imagination and often endeavours for elegance in a system, and were successful when they appeared to fit to the world. The Renaissance was a significant time of change and described in John Gribbin's Science: a history as 'when Western Europeans lost their awe of the Ancients and realised they had as much to contribute to civilization and society as the Greeks and Romans had contributed'. Within Aristotle's teachings, the universe was shown to be geocentric and this belief allowed the Christian creation story to situate 'humankind and hence the earth at the centre of a divine plan'. Aside from the European's inferiority complex, another great factor in the sustenance, albeit with some amendments, of quite ancient ideas was the power of the Christian church. The clergy were in command of all universities in Europe and could be selective over the publishing of books. They are described in Scientific Culture and the making of the Industrial West as the 'purveyors of the written and spoken word'. Therefore any theories or new ideas which could threaten the Church's authenticity could be filtered from the public domain. This effect can be seen in different locations based on the attitude of the localized clergy. When a country was run by a clergy who allowed new ideas to pass neutrally, or even to be encouraged, 'science flourished'. In contrast to this 'in parts of Catholic Europe dominated by the Inquisition, relative intellectual stagnation in science was the price to be paid'. However, European culture was eventually transformed and the burden of the classical past remedied, with actions making the period dramatic in comparison to the dormant former years in many aspects of culture and knowledge. Likely the most central and innovative concept deserving attention on the subject matter at hand is the first modern heliocentric system of the solar system, envisaged by Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. The fundamental point of controversy in his claim was of the sun being the centre of the universe, instead of the Earth, which along with other celestial bodies, revolved around it. It was principally this theory, published within 'De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium' that caused such turbulence in the academic community, and whose defence led to a revolt against the Religious institution which was later deemed by some as the 'Copernican Revolution'. Galileo Galilei made a huge leap away from the Aristotelian approach of perceiving the natural world, taking the crucial step in working towards explaining how things work, rather than speculating as to why they do so. As mentioned previously, experiment is the most distinctive component of modern science and this was the backbone of Galileo's work. A successful mathematician, he gained the highly esteemed post of Chair of Mathematics at the University of Padua in, and it was his employment of his mathematical skill that allowed him to describe interactions that he observed in the world. With the chief goal of finding the solution to a specific problem, experiment is a system of observations and controlled actions which aim to give reasonable values relevant to credible conclusions. Galileo repeatedly tested his hypotheses in this manner and used his results to decide whether these should be revised, disregarded or revered. It is important here to refer back to Galileo's proposed title of 'first scientist' and consider that although he may have been the first to utilise this technique expertly, he may not have been the very first to formulate it. In fact Galileo described the earlier William the founder of the experimental method of science who alleged that 'stronger reasons are obtained from sure experiments and demonstrated arguments than from probable conjectures and the opinions of philosophical speculators'. Although Gilbert used experimental method he did not make the further advancement of Galileo, in using a quantitative approach which allowed the use of mathematical formulas to analyze the data. In this approach, Galileo was a radical. A well known example of Galileo's new method of obtaining knowledge being subject to critique is over his claim that 'different weights fall at the same speed'. A professor, remaining defiant over the entrenched beliefs of his Aristotelian school, challenged the claim using the experiments carried out by engineer Simon Stein, who dropped lead weights from a tower and published these results. On this issue Galileo comments: 'Aristotle says that a hundred-pound ball falling from a height of one hundred cubits hits the ground before a one-pound ball has fallen one cubit. I say they arrive at the same time. You find on making the test, that the larger ball beats the smaller one by two inches. Now, behind those two inches you want to hide Aristotle's ninety-nine cubits and, speaking only of my tiny error, remain silent about his enormous mistake.' On accepting the position in Padua, Galileo had access to many influential characters. The rapport he succeeded to build must have supported him during a time when it was not unheard of for the people who adhered to beliefs contradicting religious teaching, to be severely prosecuted, e.g. Giordano Bruno in 600. It proved particularly advantageous when Galileo became acquainted with the Cardinal Roberto Bellarmine who was a leading scholar of the church and was partly accountable for Bruno's execution for heresy. Both figures were dedicated Copernicans, but only Galileo escaped the fate of death, though confined to house arrest in 633, his case was influenced enough by Bellarmine for his punishment to be lenient. Like many concepts rejected by the church, the public teaching of the Copernican theory was forbidden and this obviously made the extension of the work arduous (arduous maybe, but not impossible). During Galileo's time as Professor of mathematics in the University of Pisa, he gave additional teaching to those who could afford to pay for the benefits. This assisted his objective in spreading his own work, as during these private lectures he was able to teach scholars his own ideas, rather than the commonplace knowledge of the time. He effectively initiated his inspirations upon an influential circle which gave height to his stature, and as a result 'the beginnings of the scientific movement were confined to a minority among the intellectual elite'. The Copernican system was finally sanctioned by the church in 835/8 partly on account of support from observations of the solar system, enabled by Galileo's development of the telescope. Existing at a pivotal point in history, Galileo is a famous representative of changes which would most likely have been undertaken by countless other individuals in the time following, if it were not for his presence. The arrival of the Renaissance hurried these developments, and an example of this is suggested with the application of a 'renaissance style of art that privileged realism contributed profoundly to Galileo's ability to imagine valleys and mountains on the moon when in fact all he could see in his telescope were shadows'. It is essentially impossible to determine the 'first scientist' in the strictest sense, since there is no hard evidence to prove who initially used the all important method we would now classify as 'experiment'. It is reasonable to confer this title instead, on the person who first utilised this skill to the advantage of progress, and considering his tremendous achievements, as a pioneer of the new science, Galileo does seem worthy of this honour. Galileo's development of the telescope was able to shed light on the structure of the universe and gave support to the famous Copernican theory, and there is no argument to the immense advancement that this bestowed on science. In addition, he is credited for a wide range of important discoveries, inventions and hypotheses, including his work on pendulums and theories of motion; mechanics; invention of the first thermometer, and his numerous contributions to amassing knowledge in astronomy. On the matter of Gilbert's influence over the experimental method of Galileo, it is debatable as to whether he should gain more recognition for the birth of Science as we know it. However this is, in essence the expected progression in light of the topic and the claim that science is built on what was established previously. Therefore it may be unwarranted to use this in counter to suggestion of resting the dignified award of 'first scientist' on Galileo.""","""Birth of modern science and Galileo""","2246","""The birth of modern science marks a pivotal moment in human history when our understanding of the world underwent a profound transformation. One of the central figures in this scientific revolution was Galileo Galilei, an Italian polymath whose contributions to physics, astronomy, and the scientific method have left an indelible mark on the progress of science. Through his groundbreaking experiments, observations, and discoveries, Galileo challenged long-held beliefs and laid the foundation for the empirical approach that defines modern scientific inquiry.  Born in Pisa, Italy, in 1564, Galileo was a pioneer in the fields of observational astronomy, physics, and mathematics. His early education laid the groundwork for his future accomplishments, as he studied mathematics and natural philosophy at the University of Pisa. It was during this time that Galileo became fascinated with the work of ancient philosophers such as Aristotle and Archimedes, as well as contemporary developments in astronomy.  Galileo's contributions to the field of astronomy were revolutionary. Using his improved version of the telescope, he made a series of groundbreaking observations that challenged the prevailing geocentric model of the universe. In 1610, Galileo discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter, now known as the Galilean moons, providing compelling evidence for the Copernican heliocentric model of the solar system. This marked a significant departure from the geocentric view that had dominated scientific thought for centuries.  One of Galileo's most famous contributions to physics was his work on motion and mechanics. Building on the ideas of earlier scientists such as Johannes Kepler and Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo formulated the principles of inertia and uniform acceleration. His experiments with inclined planes and falling bodies demonstrated that objects of different masses fall at the same rate in the absence of air resistance, challenging Aristotelian notions of motion and falling bodies.  Galileo's advocacy for the empirical method and observational evidence as the foundation of scientific inquiry was a profound departure from the prevailing scholastic philosophy of his time. In his seminal work """"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems,"""" Galileo engaged in a debate between proponents of the geocentric and heliocentric models of the universe, using a dialogical format to present his arguments in a compelling and accessible way. This book, however, put him in direct conflict with the Catholic Church, leading to his trial and condemnation by the Roman Inquisition in 1633.  The trial of Galileo is a stark reminder of the tensions between science and religion that have often characterized the history of human thought. Galileo's steadfast defense of his scientific views in the face of institutional opposition exemplifies the courage and dedication required to challenge established beliefs and pave the way for scientific progress. Despite his condemnation, Galileo's work continued to inspire generations of scientists and thinkers, laying the groundwork for the scientific revolution that would follow.  In addition to his scientific achievements, Galileo's influence extended to the development of the scientific method as a systematic approach to inquiry. By emphasizing the importance of observation, experimentation, and mathematical analysis in the study of nature, Galileo helped to establish the foundations of modern science. His insistence on testing hypotheses through controlled experiments and quantifiable measurements became a hallmark of scientific practice, ushering in a new era of empirical investigation.  The legacy of Galileo Galilei continues to resonate in the modern scientific enterprise. His dedication to the pursuit of knowledge, his willingness to challenge established dogma, and his commitment to empirical evidence have left an enduring impact on the way we understand the natural world. Galileo's spirit of inquiry and his belief in the power of reason continue to inspire scientists and scholars to push the boundaries of knowledge and explore the mysteries of the universe.  In conclusion, the birth of modern science and the contributions of figures like Galileo Galilei represent a transformative period in human history. Through their bold ideas, innovative experiments, and unwavering commitment to truth, these pioneers of science laid the groundwork for the scientific revolution that would shape the world as we know it today. Galileo's legacy serves as a testament to the power of human curiosity, ingenuity, and perseverance in unlocking the secrets of the cosmos and expanding the frontiers of human knowledge.""","841"
"320","""A taste of things to comeIdentifying one definition of community is extremely problematical as it is subject to such a wide range of interpretations. Can it be identified by geographical location, inclusion in certain social or cultural groups, or shared interest? (Clarke 996). Also with education, what constitutes education differs enormously based on the situation or requirement eg academic achievement or learning how to bake a cake. So finding a standard definition or system that suits every circumstance and perspective is far from easy - it will vary depending on a multitude of criteria. This essay tracks community education from its roots in the early 920s where it had a cosy yet paternalistic feel, through radical changes which challenged traditional methods and thinking. It also considers the explosion of the education ethos of today's learning society, and discovers how collective learning can still take place in an environment that encourages a more individualistic approach. By studying the different and varying initiatives that have been used across time it examines their impact and successes of them as well as questions whether progress is really being made towards using community education to transform lives at a macro level. The Era of Really Useful KnowledgeKey words: community learning programmes, integrational, social, paternalistic, non-academicHenry Morris is considered to be the founder of community education when, during his 0 years as Chief Education Officer, he introduced what were quite radical changes to the education system. One of his main concerns was to provide an educational service to rural areas which equalled that in the towns - 'to change the whole face of the problem with rural education' (Ree 973:1). He believed everyone should have equal access to learning and was keen to preserve community life, which he felt was disintegrating as villages left rural areas to seek work in the towns. The first 'village college', was opened in Sawston in 930 and provided reading rooms, recreational and sport facilities, meeting rooms for local groups such as the Women's' Institute and scouts and offered evening classes - it was to be the focal point of the community. Morris' reforms were driven by his early experiences in education and based on his interests in religion, science and the arts. The retention of religious education in the new education system was a major debating block as control for education was wrestled from Church provision. The influences of Morris' ideals in mixed sex and class education and national curriculum can be seen in today's educational arrangements. Whilst there must be plenty of praise for the work undertaken by Morris and his transformation of the educational system, the situation can be viewed as paternalistic or controlling society by being controlled by the establishment. Radical education grew out of the Enlightenment. Expanding human nature via analytical and scientific thought challenged moral and religious underpinned traditional models of in Liverpool - the Adult Learning Scotland - 979 to the basis for the project. Freire's work in Brazil and Latin America questioned the use of education by the state to control the people, was critical of the 'banking system' of education and acknowledged the value of life experiences not just academic knowledge. The ALP introduced a student centred approach using two way encourage collective and cultural learning; so that knowledge gained could be used in everyday lives. The findings of the project added a word of caution in that this method of working needs to be introduced slowly as learners felt the method was unstructured when compared with traditional methods - time for them to adjust needs to be allowed. Although the work of Freire is considered ground breaking, there are criticisms that it is not substantial enough, is vague and could therefore be misused, is not clear enough when dealing with certain issues eg cultural requirements and in the dialogical process could the most vocal become the new oppressors? (Allman in Lovett 988). However, changes in community can also affect changing roles eg the position of women. The POWER project established in Ireland is a good example of how groups of women changed their lives by establishing, and eventually running, education programmes. The results, which provided great strides forward for the participants in terms of personal development and community involvement, still left them excluded from the decision and policy making arena that determined their become a focal point. As well as individuals being encouraged to take responsibility for their own 'employability', and reduce their dependency on the state, active citizenship' is being promoted. By valuing skills and experience other than academic achievement and an introduction of a multitude of initiatives attempts are made to include excluded groups in decision-making processes eg community projects, neighbourhood regeneration schemes and community education provision, thereby increasing their involvement. Martin believes in a staged process towards citizenship that can be brought about via education. Growing social and economic inequalities and a decline in social cohesion, resulting in increased crime rates, evidences social exclusion and has prompted an explosion of education as the into learning - mainly with the view to improving their employment prospects. During,00 learners attended Bite Size courses, which last to hours, and can be accessed via colleges, community centres, libraries, supermarkets or even pubs. However, only in 0 have gone on to further. By supporting each other through dialogue, soliciting partnership interaction and starting with their own experiences the Women's Education Centre in Southampton challenged the oppressive role of women in society. Their work is a shining example of how voice can be used to make collective changes at both a personal and political building relationships and providing learner centred programmes as key to success. The challenges of Community EducationThe identification of one definition of community education is problematic in that the concepts of both community and education have such diverse components - 'elastic and flexible' as described by in existence and with the recent learning explosion prompted by golobalization, economic instability and increased market competitiveness the provision of community education has become diverse and fragmented (Johnston in Field and Leicester 000). Added to this Freire's concept of providing education to meet learners' needs, the potential for educational initiatives is vast. Whilst this offers a wealth of opportunity in some respects, can it ever collectively be sufficient to challenge the systems it sets out to change?""","""Community Education and Its Challenges""","1216","""Community education plays a crucial role in empowering individuals, fostering social cohesion, and driving positive change within neighborhoods. It encompasses a wide range of learning opportunities and activities aimed at enhancing the well-being and skills of community members. However, despite its many benefits, community education faces several challenges that can hinder its effectiveness and impact. Understanding these challenges is essential in devising strategies to overcome them and strengthen the impact of community education initiatives.  One of the primary challenges facing community education is limited funding and resources. Many community education programs operate on tight budgets, relying heavily on government grants, donations, and volunteer support. This financial constraint often limits the scope and quality of educational offerings, making it difficult to reach a broader audience and address diverse community needs. Lack of funding can also lead to staff shortages, inadequate facilities, and outdated resources, all of which can diminish the overall effectiveness of community education efforts.  Another significant challenge is engaging marginalized and hard-to-reach populations. Community education programs often struggle to attract individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including low-income families, immigrants, and people with disabilities. Language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of awareness about available programs can act as barriers to participation, preventing these groups from benefiting from educational opportunities. Overcoming these barriers requires targeted outreach strategies, culturally sensitive curriculum development, and partnerships with local organizations that have established connections within these communities.  Furthermore, maintaining community interest and participation poses a continuous challenge for community education initiatives. In today's fast-paced world, competing demands on people's time and attention make it challenging to sustain engagement in educational activities over the long term. Community programs must constantly adapt to changing preferences and lifestyles, offering innovative and relevant learning opportunities that capture the interest of community members. Building a sense of belonging and community ownership within educational initiatives can help create sustained interest and participation among residents.  Evaluation and assessment represent another critical challenge for community education programs. Measuring the impact and effectiveness of these initiatives can be complex due to the diversity of outcomes and the long-term nature of community development work. Traditional evaluation methods may not capture the full range of benefits that community education brings, such as improved social connectedness, increased civic engagement, or enhanced well-being. Developing robust evaluation frameworks tailored to the unique goals and objectives of community education programs is essential for demonstrating their value to funders, stakeholders, and the broader community.  Moreover, ensuring sustainability and scalability of community education initiatives remains a significant challenge. Many community programs rely on short-term funding sources, making long-term planning and sustainability difficult to achieve. Scaling successful educational interventions to reach a larger audience can also be challenging, as expansion often requires additional resources, staff, and infrastructure. Building partnerships with local government agencies, businesses, and educational institutions can help secure funding, resources, and expertise needed to sustain and grow community education efforts over time.  Addressing inequality and promoting inclusivity within community education programs is another pressing challenge. Socioeconomic disparities, systemic discrimination, and unequal access to resources can perpetuate educational inequalities within communities, limiting opportunities for certain groups to engage in learning. Community education initiatives must actively work to address these disparities by creating inclusive environments, promoting diversity, and providing targeted support to marginalized populations. Embracing diversity and equity as core values in program planning and implementation is essential for ensuring that everyone has equal access to educational opportunities.  In conclusion, while community education plays a vital role in empowering individuals and strengthening communities, it faces several challenges that need to be addressed to maximize its impact. By tackling issues such as limited funding, engagement of marginalized populations, sustaining community interest, effective evaluation, scalability, and promoting inclusivity, community education programs can overcome these obstacles and create meaningful changes within neighborhoods. Through collaboration, innovation, and a deep commitment to community well-being, we can build more resilient, inclusive, and thriving communities through the power of education.""","760"
"135","""Avril Taylor's book, like many participant observation studies, is an interesting and informative read. Participant observation methods lend themselves to the study of 'deviant' groups of society and therefore through the study's very nature often result in more captivating and readable content than other research might. However, all research has flaws and limits. In this critique I will assess Taylor's research methods by considering how successful the book is in allowing for or avoiding the common limits of and problems associated with participant observation under the following headings, as identified by Layton-Henry: Layton Henry Participant Observation A lecture given at the University of Warwick 2 January 005/8 Observations may be limited by problems of access The problems of ethical dilemmas The risk that an investigator may be captured by part of the community The problems of collecting systematic and accurate data, and more importantly in this case, the presentation of data, (not identified by Layton-Henry). The risk that an investigator may influence her subjects The group or association may be atypical leading to unrepresentativeness My main criticism will focus on the deductive approach adopted by Taylor. Quite uncharacteristic to participant observation studies, this approach can be seen to have detrimental effects on Taylor's research strategies and results. Secondly, the processed and pre-interpreted nature of her results. Again, contrary to many other ethnographies, this could be seen to undermine the point of adopting participant observational methods. Both these points revolve around the problem in participant observation, that as the following definition highlights, scientific understanding is considered highly important and desirable in social research. In Taylor's attempts to produce scientific results, the impact of her study is arguably weakened. Participant observation is perhaps most usefully defined as: 'a process in which an investigator establishes a many-sided and relatively long-term relationship with a human association in its natural setting for the purpose of developing a scientific understanding of that association.' Taylor saw that the benefits of participant observation would allow her to provide a picture of women drug users through their own perspectives: 'Much of the text allows the women to speak for themselves, describing from their point of view the lifestyles which have evolved around their use of illicit drugs.' Her other main reason is that '.no ethnographic study of female drug users alone has been undertaken anywhere'. This feminist perspective is clearly one which is essential to an understanding of drug users. However, due to its qualitative nature, participant observation has many methodological risks and limits. Loftland and Loftand, Analysing Social Settings: A Guide to Qualitative Observation and Analysis, Belmont, CA, Wadsworth as referenced in Burnham et al Research Methods in Politics Palgrave Macmillan Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press, p. Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press, p. Firstly, access to the chosen group of study often proves difficult, and even after obtained, will affect the nature and success of one's study. Successful ethnographies, such as that of Whyte's 'Street Corner Society' can often depend on finding a sponsor or 'gate-keeper' who not only can introduce the observer to the subjects he/she wishes to study but is also seen in a favourable light by those subjects. Taylor was fortunate enough to find a contact, similar to that of Whyte's. Like Doc, the local drug-worker was known and respected by many of the women drug users in Taylor's study: 'He was accepted and trusted by the women.' Limitations of access also proved of little methodological concern due to the fact that being a woman worked in Taylor's favour: 'The fact that I am a woman.made me more easily accepted and gave me more freedom to explore aspects of the women's lives which a man would have found difficult.' This is supported by the detailed descriptions of the women as mothers; the role of partners and husbands in their lives and even issues of violence and rape which may not have been discovered by a male observer. However, it could also be argued that a man, by developing a long-term and close relationship with the women could have achieved similar results. Secondly, problems of language were minimalised by the fact that Taylor is a Glaswegian working in a Glaswegian community. However, as James Patrick also found in his study of a Glasgow gang, dialect and slang can differ enormously and must therefore be learned through observation: 'Born and bred in Glasgow, I thought myself au fait with the local dialect. - another serious mistake as it turned out.' Taylor therefore successfully adapted her own accent and dialect in order to be more readily accepted by the group. She employed an effective snow-balling technique in order to increase the number of women with whom she 'participated'. Taylor's access gaining methods, while to a certain extent out of her control, proved to be successful in terms of appropriateness to the aims of her study. Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press, p.2 Patrick, J, A Glasgow Gang Observed, Eyre Methuen London, p.5/8 Studying criminals can often result in ethical problems for a researcher. Taylor swore to confidentiality with the people she interviewed and spent time with. This was essential as distrust on the part of the drug users would have resulted in an unreliable study. Apart from two incidents which Taylor was unaware of at the time, she managed to conduct her research ethically and unlike Whyte refrained from becoming so involved with the group that 'participation' became illegal: 'I had to learn that, in order to be accepted by the people in a district, you do not have to do everything just as they do it.' Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press, pp.7-8 Whyte, W. F., Street Corner Society, The Social Structure of an Italian Slum, th ed University of Chicago Press, p. 17 The task of balancing acceptance with observational detachment is a very difficult one. Clearly, Taylor was not captured by any member or section of the community. However, it could be argued that she was to a certain extent emotionally captured. Taylor uses Gold's four classifications of participant observation and describes her role as 'participant-as-observer'. Yet as Whyte rightly points out: 'Most teaching resources on participant observation fail to note that the researcher, like his informants, is a social animal'. Taylor clearly sympathises with the women in her study. Before even conducting her study she sought to disprove some of the derogatory stereotypes of women drug users, including their inability to be 'good' mothers. Through spending fifteen months with fifty different women, eight of whom became 'key informants', these feelings of sympathy and even respect and fondness clearly strengthened. 'In our society, the most fulfilling role for women is still regarded as that of motherhood.only the most articulate and confident of women are able successfully to challenge this interpretation. Other less fortunate, including the women of this study, labour under feelings of inadequacy, and hence of guilt.' Whilst it is very difficult to say if and to what extent these feelings could have affected the ethnography, possible areas of influence could have been in the 'agenda-setting' process of the study. Whether aware of it or not, the desire to show women drug users in a more favourable light than normal could have affected her decisions regarding whom to participate with and observe, and the questions she asked, (particularly in the 6 in-depth interviews). Gold, R. L., 'Roles in Sociological Field Observations.' Social Forces 6:17-3 as referenced in Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press, p.3 Patrick, J, A Glasgow Gang Observed, Eyre Methuen London, p.79 Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press, p.11 Collecting accurate and systematic data is always more difficult in participant observation where the researcher cannot record data in the normal and accepted ways. I would argue that Taylor's methods were effective and non-obtrusive: '.unless I felt it was appropriate and not obstructive, I would not take notes in the presence of anyone'. For the interviews which were conducted at the end of the study she used a tape recorder. The use of tape recorders is debated by researchers: the main risk being that the interviewee may hold back information and detail when conscious of being recorded. However, it is likely that after a year of spending time with the women in her study, the subjects would have felt comfortable with disclosing personal information. Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press, p.3 Where I can identify possible flaws is in the presentation of data. Perhaps in an effort to produce a more scientific analysis of the subjects' lives, she organises the book into stages and aspects of a woman drug user's 'career'. Whilst these divisions may prove useful to the reader in understanding more clearly the life of a female drug user, it must be recognised that the information in the book has been highly processed by Taylor. The organisation of chapters, for example, 'Starting off', 'Scoring and Grafting' and 'Social networks', and the quotations from the women used in these chapters are Taylor's interpretations of separate aspects of her subjects' lives. Other ethnographies such as Patrick's 'A Glasgow Gang Observed', have adopted a more chronological structure which can help in allowing the subjects and incidents speak for themselves. However, no matter how data is presented it will always have been interpreted and processed by the researcher, highlighting the constant need for a researcher, particularly a participant observer to attempt to view his/her results objectively. Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press, p.1, p.1, p.7 Above I have mentioned that Taylor entered the study with aims to disprove some of the conclusions and stereotypes which have developed through other academics' research and through the social stigma attached to drug users: 'Against the stereotypical view of pathetic, inadequate individuals, women drug users in this study are shown to be rational, active people.' As already argued, the interpretative stage of research may have been affected by this factor, but it could also be argued that this deductive approach may have led to the possibility of influence on the subjects of the study. This quotation from Whyte's study most clearly illustrates this point: 'Now when I do something I have to think what Bill Whyte would want to know about it and how I can explain it. Before I used to do things by instinct.' This type of influence was evident in a study where it took '.eighteen months in the field before I knew where my research was going.' By entering the study with perceived ideas of its direction, while often helpful in social research, Taylor may have affected the ethnography in a way she had not intended. She states that access to the group was made easier by 'my topic, as explained to every woman that I met, namely that I was interested in finding out about the issues that are pertinent to women as opposed to men.' A desire on the part of the subjects to provide the researcher with the information she would like and hold back the information she would not can often affect the results of ethnographies. After spending fifteen months together, the subjects may have been aware of the conclusions Taylor was beginning to form and this could have affected the interviews she conducted at the end of the study. The argument against deductive research methods in participant observation is illustrated by this description: '.participant observation is intentionally unstructured in its research design, so as to maximise discovery and description rather than systematic theory testing.' Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press, p. Whyte, W. F., Street Corner Society, The Social Structure of an Italian Slum, th ed University of Chicago Press, p.91 Whyte, W. F., Street Corner Society, The Social Structure of an Italian Slum, th ed University of Chicago Press p.21 Taylor, A, Women Drug Users: An ethnography of a female Injecting Community, Clarendon Press, p.5/8 McCall, G. J. and Simmons, J. L. (eds) 'Preface' in Issues in Participant observation: A Text and Reader Addison-Wesley Publishing Company Lastly, the problem of unrepresentativeness appears to be less of a problem in 'Women Drug Users' because the lives of women who use and become addicted to drugs, in particular to heroin, are likely to be similar. This is because of the power that the drug has on the subject's body. Whilst Taylor describes and analyses the group she is studying solely, her conclusions aim to be representative of other women drug users, particularly those who live in poor or underdeveloped areas. Conclusions relating to empirical evidence are likely to apply to other communities of drug users, for example, the descriptions of the different ways the women obtained money, (see chapter: Scoring and Grafting). However, analyses of the nature of a woman drug user's life must be seen as interpretative. For example, Taylor argues that the life of a woman intravenous drug user is organised and structured due to the fact that everyday, addiction makes her follow a routine involving obtaining money, obtaining drugs and taking drugs. However, one might readily argue that this in fact describes a lifestyle over which the subject has no control and is therefore chaotic and driven by the needs of the body as opposed to the mind. It could be argued that Taylor's ethnography attempts to be too representative in some respects. Again this could be attributed to the way she decided to structure the book. A structure which was based on particular incidents in detail rather than themes or stages would have perhaps provided the reader with a more in-depth knowledge of the women she was observing. By providing description or a transcript of events or even 'non-events', (i.e. episodes where no major incident occurred but which could be considered typical of the woman drug user's everyday life), the reader would perhaps have benefited more from the qualitative style of research that participant observation studies often produce. The strength of participant observation lies in the detailed qualitative data which is obtained: 'resulting data are typically qualitative rather than quantified scores readily amenable to standard statistical analysis'. McCall, G. J. and Simmons, J. L. (eds) 'Preface' in Issues in Participant observation: A Text and Reader Addison-Wesley Publishing Company To conclude, a lot of the critical aspects to this analysis have been based on speculation. Firstly, the extent to which Taylor sought to prove her hypotheses from the beginning is unknown, perhaps even by her. Yet I have highlighted the associated risks of adopting such an approach in participant observation. Secondly, the presentation of Taylor's results has been criticised for being too processed and distant from the original, raw material. Again, to what extent the presented data differs from the original is also unknown. However, it seems that in choosing to present her results in such a fashion undermines the advantages of participant observation research. Aside from these two main criticisms, the research methods employed by Avril Taylor, especially in the collection of data, were appropriate and seemingly successful. While she may have interpreted quite a lot of the data herself, the use of the women's own perspectives and descriptions, written in their own style of dialect, allows the reader relatively large amounts of space in which to form his/her own opinion. Finally, it must be recognised that while Taylor may have been driven by a desire to prove her hypotheses, these hypotheses aimed to disprove many of the myths which can be seen to worsen the lives of the subjects of her study. She argues that the women in her study continued using illicit drugs and even were drawn to them from the beginning due to 'the inability of society either to recognise or to cater for such women's needs.' The importance of research to be not only as objective and honest as possible, but also to be worthwhile and potentially beneficial must be remembered. For as Doc is quoted to say in 'Street Corner Society': 'Mostly that is the way things are changed, by writing about them.'

This method involves the researcher becoming actively involved in the daily lives, interactions, and activities of the participants being studied. By blending into the environment under study, the researcher can gain a deeper understanding of the behaviors, beliefs, norms, and social dynamics that shape the group or community being observed.  One of the key aspects of participant observation is the dual role that the researcher assumes: that of an insider (participant) and an outsider (observer). This unique position allows the researcher to bridge the gap between objectivity and subjectivity, enabling them to access rich and nuanced data that might not be captured through other research methods. By immersing themselves in the context being studied, researchers can uncover hidden patterns, meanings, and relationships that are vital for gaining deeper insights into the social phenomena under investigation.  The process of participant observation typically involves three main stages: entry, immersion, and exit. During the entry phase, the researcher establishes rapport with the participants, gains their trust, and familiarizes themselves with the social setting. This phase is crucial for building relationships, understanding group dynamics, and setting the foundation for the research process. Immersion involves the researcher actively participating in the daily activities of the group, which may include attending events, meetings, rituals, or simply spending time with the participants in their natural environment. This stage allows the researcher to observe firsthand how individuals interact, how social norms are enforced, and how decisions are made within the group.  As the researcher immerses themselves in the field, they collect data through various means, including direct observation, participation in activities, informal conversations, interviews, and even keeping field notes. These data collection methods enable the researcher to capture both verbal and nonverbal cues, group dynamics, power relations, conflicts, and any other significant aspects of the social context. Through careful observation and documentation, researchers can uncover patterns, contradictions, and processes that shape social life in ways that may not be apparent through surveys or interviews alone.  Participant observation is particularly valuable for studying complex social phenomena, such as cultural practices, rituals, group dynamics, and social interactions that are deeply embedded within a specific context. For example, anthropologists use participant observation to study indigenous communities, religious groups, or subcultures to understand their rituals, traditions, and social structures in a holistic manner. Similarly, sociologists employ this method to investigate behaviors in real-life settings, such as workplaces, schools, or communities, to grasp the underlying mechanisms that drive social processes.  One of the key strengths of participant observation is its ability to generate rich, contextually embedded data that provide a comprehensive understanding of the nuances of social life. By immersing themselves in the field, researchers can capture the complexity, diversity, and uniqueness of human behavior in its natural context. This depth of understanding is particularly valuable for generating theories, developing hypotheses, and gaining new insights that can contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the social sciences.  Moreover, participant observation allows researchers to uncover the subjective meanings, interpretations, and perspectives of the participants themselves. By engaging directly with the individuals being studied, researchers can access their lived experiences, values, beliefs, and emotions in ways that quantitative methods may not fully capture. This insider perspective is essential for developing a more nuanced and empathetic understanding of the social world, as it helps researchers empathize with the struggles, joys, and complexities of human life in diverse social settings.  Despite its numerous strengths, participant observation also presents challenges and limitations that researchers need to navigate. One of the primary concerns is the issue of researcher bias and subjectivity. Because the researcher is an active participant in the social setting, their presence and interactions may influence the behaviors of the participants and the dynamics of the group. To address this challenge, researchers must maintain reflexivity, transparency, and ethical awareness throughout the research process to minimize bias and ensure the validity and reliability of their findings.  Another challenge of participant observation is the time-intensive nature of the method. Immersing oneself in the field, building relationships, and collecting data through firsthand experiences can be a lengthy process that requires patience, dedication, and flexibility. Researchers must be prepared to invest significant time and effort in the research process to build trust, observe meaningful interactions, and capture the complexity of social life authentically.  Furthermore, the question of generalizability is often raised in relation to participant observation. Because this method focuses on in-depth, context-specific understanding, the findings may not always be easily transferable to other settings or populations. While participant observation excels at providing rich, detailed insights into specific social contexts, researchers need to be cautious when making broader claims or generalizations based on their findings. Supplementing participant observation with other research methods, such as surveys, interviews, or statistical analysis, can help researchers triangulate their data and enhance the rigor and validity of their research outcomes.  In conclusion, participant observation is a powerful and flexible research method that allows researchers to delve deep into the complexities of social life, culture, and human behavior. By immersing themselves in the field, engaging with participants, and observing social interactions firsthand, researchers can generate rich and contextually embedded data that shed light on the underlying mechanisms, norms, and dynamics that shape social phenomena. While participant observation presents challenges in terms of bias, time commitment, and generalizability, its strengths in providing detailed, nuanced insights make it a valuable tool for social researchers seeking to understand the intricacies of human behavior in its natural context. By embracing the complexities and richness of social life through participant observation, researchers can contribute meaningfully to the advancement of knowledge in the social sciences and foster a deeper appreciation for the diversity and dynamics of human societies.""","1165"
"3046","""Perfection Hotels is a small UK-based hospitality company, currently operating hotels in the major UK cities, one in London, Birmingham and Glasgow respectively. All the hotels are operating under the same brand, where they strive to provide 'the perfect hospitality experience' to their guests. The hotel group is relatively new in the market, and has decided to grow and become a bigger player in the market through international expansion. However, due to the lack of international experience, the first country in which to expand to could not be very different to the UK. (More information about Perfection Hotels in Appendix -Company Profile). Canada is the second largest country in the world, located north of the United States in North America. With a population of almost 3 million, the country has developed in parallel with the US both technologically and Hotels has been very successful in the luxury, star market sector. This market is highly competitive, and the hotels are described in superlative terms and far exceed normal expectations in terms of design, level of luxus, service, elegance and uniqueness. Jackson and that luxury brands have a high status and possess a desirability that extends beyond their function. The target market for Perfection Hotels are both leisure and business travellers, but they emphasizes the business market, both domestic and internationally. Business EnvironmentExpanding a hospitality operation internationally can be problematic, and in order to be effective and efficient in the task a company must respond to the opportunities, challenges, risks, and limitations posed by the macro business the macro environment as 'the broad environment outside of an organisation's industry and markets', and Reich concludes that companies in general has very little control over it. The business environment in Canada is in many ways similar to the UK. Both countries are political stable, and are ranked in the top in terms of level of democracy, corruption, press freedom and civil/political, and the governments are investing equally in ICT in their respective that technology factors will dramatically alter the tourism demand in the future. Demand in Canada and the US is therefore significantly boosted by the strong development of mass media, information technology such as the internet, as well as the excellent dominating the market through economies of scale, making the threat of entry for other hotels into the market fairly low. As a result of the many developed information channels such as the, is therefore quite low. Cultural factors are also similar, however, the ethnic diversity of the British and the French parts of the population must be taken into consideration. There is a strong demand for hospitality services in the luxury sector, both in the leisure and the business market. International demand is high, espescially from the US where culture and levels of economic development are similar to the Canadian franchising as 'a business relationship whereby a franchisor permits a franchisee to use their brand name, product, or system of business in a specified and ongoing manner in return for a fee', while management contracts are 'an arrangement under which operational control of an enterprise.is vested by contract in a separate enterprise which performs the necessary menegement functions in return for a fee' (Young et al. in Gannon and Johnson, 997, p.94). An ownership, on the other hand, is when a company invest in- and operate a hotel will be valuable since the hotel group is new to international expansion. According to Erramilli et al., management contracts are favoured over franchising when a company have capabilities that can not be reproduced by others, when there are qualified local investments in the host market, and when the culture in the host country is similar to home. On the other hand, Dev et al. argues that franchising should be chosen when there is availability of quality management in the host market, and when the business environment is highly developed. In the case of Perfection Hotels, management contracts will be their best modal choice, giving more control over their operations and brand standards than franchising. The developed Canadian economy and the cultural similarities backs up this choice, as well as the argument that hospitality companies entering a highly developed country can count on rule of law and fair enforcement of legal contracts. Key Target MarketsEven though Canada's luxury hotel market is very attractive for Perfection Hotels, a thorough segmentation process of the market must be done, as well as a prioritation of the segments to be targeted, before any business can be conducted. Dibb argues that targeting is an identification of segments where marketing efforts should be concentrated, and decisions should to be consistent with the needs of the customers in the specific segments, resources available in the company, the competition in the segment, and the overall business environment. After segmenting, each segment has to be assessed in terms of that the desire to travel within Canada is significant, which is backed up by statistics showing that there was a fairly high increase in number of trips, room nights, and expenditure for Canadian travel within Canada from 003 to four levels of centricity, giving Perfection Hotels the choice between an ethnocentric, polycentric, regiocentric, or geocentric approach. Ethnocentrism is when one's own group is placed in the center and used as a reference for all others, and the symbols and values of that group are regarded as brand equity as brand assets and liabilities related to the brand that add to or subtract from a value provided by a service. Supphellen argues that managers need a deep understanding of brand equity in order to develop the optimal brand strategies, communicate effectively and compete successfully. The key to a successful brand is to create added value in the minds of consumers, which is building a perceived value beyond the observable value to differentiate the that since brand equity can provide a higher market share and increase loyalty, the health of the company are dependent on the brand image. Therefore it must be strongly emphasized by management. Aaker and Joachimsthaler outlined the concept of brand architecture, which is an organising structure of the brand portfolio, specifying the roles of the different brands an organisation possess and the relationship between them. They argued that maintaining the relationship between the main brand and sub-brands could be done by using different strategies such as house of brands, endorsed brands, sub-brands, and branded house. However, since Perfection Hotels only has one brand, this is not something that need to be considered at the moment. A brand can in most instances be seen as a promise to the consumers, who expect to receive the values associated with the brand. However, the nature of the service industry, where the service encounter is a critical part, makes it hard to achieve full consistency in the delivery the terms 'soft' and 'hard' brands. This relates to a company's marketing mix strategy, and whether this is standardised or adapted. A hard brand have a standard and consistent mix, whereas the opposite applies to a soft brand. However, all brands are positioned between the two extremes, and there is no indication that one is better than the that logos are used as a mean to indicate brand origin, brand ownership, and to build brand associations and equity. Logos can add value to the brand reputation, and types of logos vary from a company name or trademark that are written in a distinctive form, to abstract logos that are unrelated to the name of the based on the company name. The perfect position and distance between the circles in the background convey the message that Perfect Hotels deliver a quality experience, providing that little extra service. This is also shown in their positioning statement, 'the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra'. The colours used is meant to differentiate the brand from other luxury brands, and make potential consumers remember Perfection Hotels. positioning as 'an act of designing the company's offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the target market's mind'. There are three main elements in positioning, that is create an image, communicate customer benefits, and differentiate a brand from out, the message is; 'standardise as much as feasible and customise as much as needed'. Expanding internationally, Perfection Hotels is faced with a business environment quite similar to home. The target market is also the same, therefore most of the marketing mix should standardised, except from the marketing communication element. To find suitble locations for the first hotel, a population of minimum 5/80,00 and proximity to a major airport should be used as key selection criteria. Four cities, Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, and Ottawa, meet these specifications. However, Toronto is the most suitable. With a population of, million, the city is one of the most accessible cities in North America. million people in Canada are in the range of less than one hour drive, and 0% of the US population is less than a 0 minute flight away. Lester B. Pearson International Airport in Toronto is also the main gateway to another key distribution channel, and in addition Perfection Hotels should strive to establish a good relationship with major business travel agents. Perfection Hotels pricing strategy should also be standardised, using a cost-plus approach, which is setting prices to cover costs plus a predetermined profit (Harris, 999). This will make the prices high, but the target markets are willing to pay a little extra the excellent product Perfection Hotels offer. However, competitor prices are also taken into consideration and followed closely, and since the prices has been just below the highest price level in the UK, this should also be the case in Canada. The only element of the marketing mix that should be adopted to fit the diversion in the Canadian market is marketing communication. As mentioned earlier, 5/8% of the population are of French origin, most of who are living in Quebec. They tend to be very sensitive to the use of their preferred language, as well as having a slightly different view of advertising and the use of symboles than the people of British origin. They also use TV as an information channel to a higher degree (Jarvis and Thomson, 995/8). Thus, Perfection Hotels should adapt the advertising strategy in both the British and French part of the population. This advertising should be delivered through TV-commercials (more emphasized in Quebec), selected magazines, and billboards at major airports in Canada and the US, preferably in business lounges. Perfection Hotels should also use sales promotion in form of frequent guest award to gain relationships with the guests, increasing the opportunity for repeat business. Personal selling is the final part of the promotion mix, and should be used to contact the travel representatives for major Canadian and US corporations, trying to establish long-term relationships and be preferred as the number one choice for their travelling employees. ConclusionBased on the different sections in this report, there is no doubt that Perfection Hotels should go through with the plans of expanding their luxury hotel business into the Canadian market. The Canadian business is very much similar to the one prevailing in the UK, providing no major barriers. However, the ethnic diversion betweeen the British and French part of the population must be taken into consideration. There is also an established demand for luxury hotel services in the business and leisure market, both domestic and internationally through the US market. On the other hand, competition is quite fierce, but this applies to the hospitality industry in general, and not only to Canada. All factors taken into consideration, Canada is an attractive market for Perfection Hotels expansion plans, and there is a good potential for making profits. There are certain limitations in this report. First of all, most of the statistics are collected from various internet sources. These statistics are an essential part of the discussions, and the base for many of the conclusions made throughout the report. There is, however, no guarantee that these sources are accurate or valid. Canadian government web sites can usually be trusted in terms of validity of the content, but since many other internet sources have been used, it must be recognized that some of the statistics in this report, and conclusions based upon the statistics, might not be accurate. This report is also based upon a number of journal articles and books. It is trusted that most of the conclusions made, as well as the information provided, by the authors are valid. However, some of that information might not be 00% reliable. Also, the conclusions drawn by these authors might have been biased and triggered by their own opinions instead of the facts, which again make them unreliable. However, whereas internet sources are more likely to be unreliable, most journal articles and books are considered as very reliable sources.""","""Perfection Hotels' International Expansion Strategy""","2511","""Perfection Hotels is a renowned luxury hotel chain known for its impeccable service, exquisite amenities, and exceptional hospitality.

"6012","""Food manufacture is the process of turning a raw food material into a finished product, usually by means of a large-scale industrial operation in which mechanical power and machinery are another topic of public concern, yet it has the potential to offer very significant improvements in the quantity, quality and acceptability of the world's food supply, but issues of product safety, environmental concerns, and also ethics must be and are continuing to be addressed. For the development of improved food materials, GM improves pest, disease and herbicide resistance in plants and may also provide drought resistance, improved nutritional content and improved sensory properties. It is also faster and cheaper and allows for greater precision than traditional selective breeding techniques. Morris and Bate, 999 believe that GM crops hold the key to solving famine over the next 0 years, and to using less land without causing an increase in pollution. Environmental pollution is caused by contaminants in air, water, or land, by both natural phenomena and human activity. The greatest source of air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels by power plants as well as by motor vehicles, which results in increase in carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide and ozone. All of which have either a known or suspected effect on human health as well as environmental balance. Human activities are often the cause for localised water pollution, as water becomes contaminated with heavy metals, toxic chemicals and bacteria. One of the worlds worst man-made environmental disasters is the shrinking of the Aral Sea, which is now only / of its size 0years ago. This was caused by the Soviet Unions decision in the 95/80s to convert much of the area to land for growing cotton. Rivers, which once flowed to the sea, were dammed and redirected to the plantations. The water and soil were polluted with salt and chemicals, including nitrates, through heavy use of chemical fertilisers. The draining of water also dried out the areas top soil, producing dust filled with poisonous chemicals, which caused respiratory problems in nearby residents. The contamination resulted in an increase in birth abnormalities, liver cancer, and blood disease in some areas. Fishing was also dramatically final consumer products (cream, butter, cheese and yoghurt). Between 984 and 997, there was steady growth of the industry, with consumption increased by 0% and production by 6%. During the same time, however employment in the industry fell by % as a result of increased automation. The dairy industry is distinguished by the presence of companies of different sizes, from small specialised industries to large fully automated production. The main environmental issue resulting from the farming stage of the dairy industry is the pollution of water beds by animal farming, which is also apparent in dairy processing activities, where there is considerable water usage and discarding of effluents. During processing, the main problems stem from the disposal of packaging and the recycling of used containers whilst following the EU or national standards of practise. In many industries, the entire processes of food manufacture can be automated, from the reception of ingredients, through processing and packaging and then to the warehouse. This requires a higher capital investment by the manufacturers, but results in improved quality assurance, reduced production costs and less wastage. Automation increases production efficiency, uses less energy and often fewer operators, and generates an increased revenue and market share because of the resulting high quality of the finished product (Fellows, 000). This essay reviews the development of man and agriculture, and ultimately the food manufacturing industry, with particular reference to some of the concerns and also the benefits. Manufactured food is often different to home prepared food, for example the shelf life of foods must be extended with preservation techniques, which inhibit microbiological or biochemical changes to allow time for distribution, sales and home storage. However with these changes, the food industry is trying to make a positive contribution to society, by increasing the variety in our diets by providing a range of attractive flavours, colours, aromas and textures in food and ultimately in providing the nutrients required for health. Without the scale of modern food manufacture, we could not sustain the population, and the modern lifestyle could not allow for a reversion to natural ways of food gathering. In this situation, it is more a case of 'normal' versus 'natural'; the whole of industrialised society is dependant on the food industry, in the same way it is dependant on, for example the health care profession. Despite this, it can be argued that we are defying natural selection; since the beginning of time, shortages of food and famine have been the limiting factor to population growth explosions. If food manufacture continues to grow and thus allow our population to expand, we could reach the point were there are not enough other resources on the planet to substantiate life, for this reason, careful consideration must be taken about the long term effects of food manufacture on the environment. In summary, modern agriculture and food technologies provide benefits both to human health and to the environment, therefore, I conclude, that food manufacture, although not scientifically natural is essential, both for our development to date and for the future.""","""Food manufacture and environmental impact""","1027","""Food manufacture plays a significant role in our daily lives, impacting not only our sustenance but also the environment. From agricultural practices to food processing and packaging, every step in the food supply chain has environmental implications. Understanding and mitigating these impacts are crucial for creating a more sustainable food system.  Agricultural practices are at the forefront of food production's environmental impact. The use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in conventional farming can lead to soil degradation, water pollution, and harm to biodiversity. These chemicals can leach into groundwater, affecting aquatic ecosystems and human health. Additionally, deforestation for agriculture contributes to habitat loss and climate change.  Livestock farming is another major contributor to environmental issues. The production of meat and dairy products requires significant resources, such as water and feed, leading to high carbon emissions and land use. Livestock farming is a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Sustainable practices, such as rotational grazing and feed efficiency improvements, can help reduce the environmental impact of livestock production.  Food processing and manufacturing also have environmental consequences. Energy-intensive processes, such as heating, cooling, and packaging, contribute to carbon emissions. The transportation of raw materials and finished products further adds to the environmental footprint of the food industry. Moreover, food waste generated during processing and manufacturing contributes to methane emissions in landfills.  Packaging is another critical aspect of food manufacture that has significant environmental implications. Single-use plastic packaging, commonly used in the food industry, contributes to pollution of oceans and landfills. Recycling rates for food packaging are often low, leading to a build-up of plastic waste in the environment. Sustainable packaging options, such as compostable materials and reusable containers, can help reduce the environmental impact of food packaging.  To address these environmental challenges, the food industry is increasingly adopting sustainability practices. Sustainable agriculture, such as organic farming and agroecology, focuses on reducing chemical inputs, conserving soil health, and promoting biodiversity. Precision agriculture technologies, such as GPS-guided tractors and drones, help optimize resource use and minimize environmental impact.  In food processing, energy-efficient technologies, such as solar panels and waste heat recovery systems, are being implemented to reduce carbon emissions. Water recycling systems help conserve water resources, while biodegradable packaging materials offer alternatives to traditional plastics. Additionally, food manufacturers are exploring innovative ways to reduce food waste through better inventory management and food donation programs.  Consumers also play a crucial role in reducing the environmental impact of food manufacture. By making sustainable food choices, such as buying local, organic, and minimally processed foods, consumers can support environmentally friendly practices in the food industry. Reducing food waste at the household level through proper meal planning and storage also contributes to a more sustainable food system.  Government policies and regulations are essential for driving sustainability in the food industry. Initiatives such as carbon pricing, sustainable agriculture incentives, and plastic waste reduction targets help incentivize businesses to adopt environmentally friendly practices. Collaboration between policymakers, industry stakeholders, and consumers is key to creating a more sustainable food system.  In conclusion, food manufacture has a significant environmental impact across the entire supply chain, from agriculture to processing and packaging. By adopting sustainable practices, such as organic farming, energy-efficient processing technologies, and eco-friendly packaging solutions, the food industry can mitigate its environmental footprint. Consumer awareness and support for sustainable food choices, coupled with government policies and industry innovation, are essential for building a more environmentally friendly food system that ensures the health of both people and the planet.""","703"
"6062","""In this project, I aim to construct a small scale corpus of two match reports of the English national football team's games from each of the following sources - The Guardian, The Telegraph, Yahoo! Sport and BBC sport online. Although this sample is not as large as I would have liked due to lack of availability of such resources, I feel that for a study of this size it will be sufficient.. Questions to be answeredIn this study, I aim to answer two questions: Do online news services use more adjectives when reporting the English national football team's games than broadsheet newspaper?Do the samples use adjectives differently in this context or is there a specific way adjectives are used across all samples?After taking into consideration the answers from these questions I will be able to formulate an answer to my main question - 'How do broadsheet newspapers and online based news site differ in their use of adjectives in reporting the English nation football team's victories and defeats?' Method2. Samples usedI decided to use two matches from each of my sources - England Argentina and Northern Ireland England. Although the game against Northern Ireland was a competitive game whilst the game against Argentina was a friendly, I felt the traditional rivalry between the England and Argentina as well as the dramatic fashion in which the game was won would serve to balance out this difference.. Corpus constructionIn constructing the corpus I decided to use AntConc as my concordancer and Concapp to create wordlists. These are both freeware programs and although they have less features than commercial software, for this small investigation I felt they would be adequate. Wordlist constructionTo determine how adjectives are used relating to the English football team I decided to first build a wordlist using Concap for the broadsheet and online news services samples as I felt this would allow me an overview to evaluate my results which would in turn give me the opportunity to investigate any interesting features. For clarification, I edited the results to show only adjectives. Both wordlists can be found in section.. ConcordancesWith the wordlist in place, I then decided to divide the adjectives into three main groups - those with generally positive connotations, those with generally negative connotations and those with generally neutral connotations. I did this because I felt taking a sample of each of these different types would allow me to evaluate if there are any differences in how positive, negative or neutral adjectives are used both in relation to describing the English football team and between samples as a whole. I took a sample of the first ten positive and negative adjectives and the first five neutral adjectives from each sample group and used AntConc to check what words appeared in concordance with these types of adjectives. I felt the first ten positive and negative adjectives would be a broad enough sample to allow me to make some useful observations about the results, but not so many as to distract from the objectives of this project. In regards to the negative and neutral adjectives from the online group, I would have liked to have had ten concordances from each sample group but the online news sample did not have enough neutral or negative adjectives to allow this. The broadsheet newspaper sample however has significantly more of both groups that the online sample. I therefore decided to use the first five neutral and ten negative adjectives from the broadsheet sample and the all of the neutral adjectives and negative adjectives I could find from the online grouped them either as referring to an individual, a group or an object. The results can be found in section. and support the idea that it is a general aspect of language use and not specific to online news sites or broadsheet newspapers. ConclusionIn this project, I have shown that although online news sites share some features with broadsheet newspapers I also identified some shared features that the evidence I gathered from the BNC corpus suggests are part of language use in general. I also identified differences in adjectival use between online news sites and broadsheet newspapers, relating them to the differences in target audience and also to literature on the subject. Both online news sites and broadsheet newspapers have many shared features, however I feel this project has shown that the use of adjectives is sufficiently different to distinguish two distinctive styles which are aimed towards two different target audiences. If I were to perform a follow up study it would be interesting to add transcripts of televised news reports and tabloid newspaper articles to the samples already collected to determine if the online news reports have similar adjectival usage to either of these groups. From the evidence gathered in this report, I would suggest a televised news report would bear a stronger resemblance to an online news report than either of the newspapers. Results5/8.

Adjectives are not mere embellishments in sports reporting; they play a crucial role in painting vivid pictures for the audience, evoking emotions, and capturing the intensity and excitement of sports events. When used effectively, adjectives can elevate sports reporting from a mundane recitation of facts to a compelling narrative that immerses readers or viewers in the thrill of the game.  In the realm of sports reporting, adjectives serve as the colorful brushstrokes that enliven the canvas of a match or a player's performance. They are the tools that allow sports journalists to convey the speed of a sprint, the strength of a punch, the precision of a pass, or the finesse of a goal. By carefully selecting adjectives, sports reporters can enhance the sensory experience for their audience, enabling them to feel the adrenaline rush of a race, the tension of a tiebreaker, or the jubilation of a victory.  One of the primary functions of adjectives in sports reporting is to provide context and character to the players and teams involved. Adjectives help create a narrative around athletes, bringing their personalities, skills, and achievements to life for the audience. For instance, describing a tennis player as """"gritty,"""" """"determined,"""" or """"unyielding"""" can offer insights into their competitive spirit and mental toughness. Similarly, characterizing a team as """"dominant,"""" """"resilient,"""" or """"underdog"""" can set the stage for the audience to understand their journey and motivations.  Moreover, adjectives are powerful tools for capturing the atmosphere and ambiance of a sports event. Whether it's the deafening roar of a crowd, the palpable tension in the air during a crucial penalty shootout, or the exuberant celebrations that follow a game-winning shot, adjectives help recreate these sensory experiences for readers or viewers who may not be physically present at the venue. By choosing descriptive adjectives that evoke sights, sounds, and emotions, sports reporters can transport their audience to the heart of the action, making them feel like active participants in the game.  In addition to their descriptive function, adjectives in sports reporting also serve an evaluative purpose. Sports journalists often use adjectives to assess and critique the performances of athletes, teams, or coaches. Whether praising a player for their """"stellar performance,"""" criticizing a team for their """"lackluster effort,"""" or commending a coach for their """"strategic brilliance,"""" adjectives help express judgments and opinions in a succinct and impactful manner. This evaluative use of adjectives adds depth and perspective to sports reporting, guiding the audience in interpreting the significance of events and outcomes.  It is crucial for sports journalists to exercise discretion and balance when using adjectives in their reporting. While adjectives can enhance the narrative and engage the audience, overuse or hyperbolic language can undermine the credibility and objectivity of the reporting. Adjectives should be employed judiciously to supplement and enrich the factual information presented rather than overshadowing it. Striking a harmonious blend of descriptive, evaluative, and contextual adjectives can transform sports reporting into a compelling and immersive storytelling experience.  Furthermore, the choice of adjectives in sports reporting can reflect the tone and style of the publication or media outlet. From the lyrical and emotive language of feature articles to the concise and analytical tone of match reports, adjectives play a pivotal role in shaping the overall voice and impression of sports journalism. Tailoring the selection of adjectives to align with the editorial guidelines, target audience, and editorial stance of the publication is essential for maintaining consistency and credibility in sports reporting.  In conclusion, adjectives are indispensable tools in the arsenal of sports journalists, enabling them to bring sports events to life, convey emotions, provide context, and offer evaluations. By carefully selecting and deploying adjectives in their reporting, sports journalists can elevate the quality of their storytelling, engage their audience on a deeper level, and capture the essence of sports moments with authenticity and flair. Adjectives are not mere embellishments in sports reporting; they are the building blocks of a captivating narrative that transcends mere play-by-play accounts and resonates with sports enthusiasts worldwide.""","848"
"142","""The history of English law is long standing and well established. As stated in Keeton's book, 'the doctrine of precedent inherently brings legal history to bear upon current judicial decisions.' Due to the distinctive nature of precedents, the specificity of cases had been coloured by its uniqueness and independence. Every verdict in individual cases had imposed a remarkable influence on the development of the law of tort. Many reasoning as well as rulings had even been extended into modern days. According to Keeton's investigation, in early nineteenth century, the common practice of the society was politically incorrect. The concern over how to identify the problem of proximity had created a loud noise. Meanwhile, the whole system was still at embryo stage. Some might argue that when goods were sold from the manufacturer to distributors, those products were then expected to be resold to other retailers and eventually reaching the hands of consumers. Because of the unknown size of the public being involved behind, the society tended not to burden the manufacturers and sellers with too much pressure. Hence, it was generally accepted that the responsibility should not be passed onto their shoulders. Yet, a gleam of hope shined in this apparently desperate situation, lightened the darkness. Originally, in Heaven v. Pender, the concept of negligence was not approved by Cotton and Bowen L.JJ. After years and years of criticism, the importance of the duty of care had been stressed. And in law's term, a number of previous judges had tried to work out a formula to define the duty of care. Firstly, Brett M.R. provided a statement with a relatively wide meaning. He, became Lord Esher in later time, amended his idea by saying it in a less vague way. Then with Lords Atkin, Thankerton and Macmillan coming next, their comments given those days had inaugurated a new era in law of negligence. 1 Q.B.D. Only if physical harm was caused, the ground for accounting negligence was possibly formed. At that time, the relevant law can be applied purely relied on the law of contract. It covered a very limited area as the linkage was being built up in between buyers and sellers only which had made it more difficult to make the manufacturer of defective products liable to third parties. The problem then came up, Mrs. Donoghue did not purchase the ginger beer in. But, her friend did not suffer much. So, even if she had decided to engage in a lawsuit, the compensation could have been a pretty small amount which was insufficient to recover Mrs. Donoghue's harm, her physical illness and mental impact. However, as a third person, the bargaining counter of Mrs. Donoghue is very weak since she had no direct relationship with the seller. Moreover, the seller is just one of the retailers. To make it meaningful, the plaintiff had made up her mind to sue Stevenson, the manufacturer. And the final outcome had written a new page in tort law and case law. The results boosted popular morale and encouraged same type of cases being put to court. The past experience shadowed a lot on tort law. It was always difficult to fit in several standard frameworks. In order to raise a practical claim, the plaintiff would need to look for particular pattern to follow under the spirit of common law. The winning of the case Donoghue v. Stevenson had examined the association in between a general public sentiment of wrongdoing and its responsibility. It had shown that the liability for negligence did exist, successfully opposing the general rule. Furthermore, the interpretation of Lord Macmillan had emphasized on the last few lines, 'The grounds of action may be as various and manifold as human errancy; and the conception of legal responsibility may develop in adaptation to altering social conditions and standards. The criterion of judgment must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life. The categories of negligence are never closed.' A.C. 62 Derived from the holding of Winterbottom v. Wright. On the other hand, the dictum made by Lord Atkin had put forward a relatively concrete guideline for the posterity to follow. This valuable notion introduced was the 'neighbour' principle. 'The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my meighbour? Receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neightbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question' addressed by Lord Atkin. Some sort of duty of care had been recognized to an outsider with whom it had no contract at all. It is also a fateful event to determine that a manufacturer did owe a duty of care to the ultimate consumer, not just buyers and sellers. Other than evidently outlined the method should be adopted to define the vicinity or proximity within reasonable range, the decision could never make it any clearer that the existing precedents was no longer an obstacle in developing the tort of negligence. In handling Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co., Lord Ried further agreed with Lord Atkin's speech. Thus he expressed his interest to regard Donoghue v. Stevenson as a close relationship with them (neighbouring effect). The USA had allowed the claimant to go on a direct claim against the manufacturer, provided that the skipping of procedures could allocate resources like time and money properly (Gerven et al 998). It was not until the establishment of The UK Consumer Protection Act 987 to obtain the similar outcome with USA. Referring to this victorious case, the general 'proximity' involved was totally granted on relationship and should not be confused with 'proximate cause' (Gerven et al 998). It associated with the determination of remoteness upon consequences of defendant's actions in the context of causation. To begin with Donoghue v. Stevenson, other cases continued putting to law might not be confined to physical injury, but starting to expand to aspects like mental damage, nervous shock, emotional distress and even financial loss. The consequential chain joined up all those cases progressively. For instance, Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd v. Heller & Partners Ltd., Smith v. Eric S. Bush coupled with T v. Surrey County Council (Percy, 977). Implied in later case, Stennett v. Hancock, there is no any kind of formal or direct relationship in between the claimant and the defendant. Yet, by taking the neighbour test into account, the garage was found to owe a duty of care. The same applies in Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills Ltd. Tort seemed to have acted as an alternative way-out or route to seek indemnification. Last but not least, in impressive titles such as Malfroot v. Noxal Ltd. and Brown v. Cotterill, Lewis J. and Lawrence J. applied the principles being found in Donoghue v. Stevenson respectively, revealing the existence of duty of care (Percy, 977). A.C. 65/8, HL WLR 90, HL, All ER All ER 78 A.C. T.L.R. 5/81: a sidecar parted from the motor-cycle while climbing a gradient injured the passenger. 1 T.L.R. 1: a tombstone in a churchyard was erected causing the monument fell upon the plaintiff. With respect to the principles of UK law, the court usually exerted creative power in establishing case law (Adams, 003). Even though common law had not been decreed by statute, it is influential to cases which would appear afterwards. To certain extent, those lengthy views done by judges were served as guidelines. Conclusively, before the hearing of Donoghue v. Stevenson, the fundamentals of the law of negligence had always been questioned. How to prove the existence of the duty of care? What were the requirements and limits? The prominent decision definitely answered all these exclamation marks.""","""History of English tort law""","1666","""English tort law has a rich and complex history that dates back centuries, evolving through landmark cases and legislative developments. The term """"tort"""" originates from the Latin word """"tortus,"""" meaning wrong or injustice, and refers to civil wrongs that cause harm to individuals or their property. Over time, English tort law has become a crucial aspect of the legal system, providing a framework for seeking compensation for damages caused by wrongful actions.  The roots of English tort law can be traced back to the royal courts of the Middle Ages, where judges applied customary laws to resolve disputes between individuals. One of the earliest recorded cases in English tort law is the 1368 case of Thomas v. Sorrell, where the court recognized a claim for trespass against the plaintiff's property. This case laid the foundation for the development of the law of torts as a distinct legal category.  During the early modern period, English courts continued to expand the scope of tort law, establishing principles that form the basis of modern tort law. One significant development was the concept of negligence, which emerged in the 18th century through cases like Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932). This case famously established the """"neighbour principle,"""" setting a precedent for the duty of care owed by individuals to others who may be affected by their actions.  The 19th century witnessed further advancements in English tort law, with courts recognizing new causes of action and refining existing principles. Landmark cases such as Rylands v. Fletcher (1868) introduced the doctrine of strict liability for ultrahazardous activities, while Heaven v. Pender (1883) established the test for determining negligence in cases involving personal injury.  The 20th century saw significant legislative reforms and judicial decisions that shaped the landscape of English tort law. The Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 introduced the concept of contributory negligence, allowing for a reduction in damages if the claimant was partly responsible for their injury. Later, the landmark decision in Donoghue v. Stephenson (1932) expanded the scope of duty of care to cover foreseeable harm caused by negligent acts.  In recent years, English tort law has continued to evolve in response to changing societal norms and technological advancements. Cases involving defamation, privacy rights, and environmental liability have pushed the boundaries of tort law and raised important questions about the scope of civil liability in modern society.  Today, English tort law remains a dynamic and evolving field that plays a crucial role in protecting individuals and their rights. From the early origins in medieval courts to the complex legal principles of the present day, the history of English tort law reflects the continuous adaptation of legal norms to meet the challenges of a changing world. As society progresses, the principles of justice and accountability embedded in tort law continue to guide courts in resolving disputes and ensuring that individuals are held accountable for their actions.""","576"
"6129","""The standard model of an atom that we have today started life in 911 when the well-known physicist Ernest Rutherford put forward his 'classical' idea of the atom. He proposed the existence of a nucleus, a small central region of the atom that contains all of its positive charge. This acted as the 'hub' of the atom with the electrons randomly fitting in around it, sometimes described as a 'cloud of electrons'. But this presented a problem. If an electron was stagnant outside the nucleus of the atom then it should fall back towards the nucleus, causing it to collapse. Rutherford tried to rectify this problem by imagining the electrons orbiting around the nucleus in a fashion not too dissimilar to the planets in our solar system. But it is known that orbital motion involves a continuous acceleration. This means that as the velocity of the electrons changed they should radiate energy and as a result fall back into the nucleus. Therefore, it didn't matter what the electrons were doing relative to the nucleus, they would always fall back into the nucleus according to the model. Subsequently, Rutherford's atom could not be stable according to the classical laws of electrodynamics. A young physicist named Neils Bohr was the first to identify this major fault in Rutherford's atom and one of the first to see that the solution was to use quantum rules to describe the behaviour of electrons within atoms. Bohr recognised that the electrons could not spiral inward out of those orbits, emitting radiation as they did so, because they were only allowed to emit whole pieces of energy, quanta. As a result Bohr decided to venture down the road of including electron states, which corresponded to fixed amounts of energy or energy levels as they are now known. This came from the idea of quantum theory, already a hot research topic for many scientists at the time of Bohr's postulates. Bohr's postulates were both daring and ridiculously intuitive at the time. He proposed energy shells where electrons didn't radiate, particular values of angular momentum and quantum leaps. These were the real steps forward in terms of integrating quantum theory into the model of the classical atom proposed by Rutherford, as quantum leaps in particular identified the ability of electrons to move between energy levels emitting radiation as photons. Bohr's atom can be described very simply with the use of a the dense central region called the nucleus, and the electrons orbit the nucleus much like planets orbiting the Sun. The great early triumph of Bohr's work, in 913, was that it explained the spectrum of light from the simplest atom, hydrogen. White light is made up of all different colours with different wavelengths and frequencies, i.e. short wavelength blue light is on the opposite end of the spectrum to long wavelength red light. Spectral lines therefore represent very precise frequencies of light. The spectrum of hydrogen is very simple, because the atom has only has one proton and electron. The lines in the spectrum that provide unique identification of hydrogen are called the Balmer lines, after a Swiss teacher who worked out a formula describing the pattern in 885/8. Balmer's formula relates the frequencies in the spectrum at which hydrogen lines occur relative to one another. However, Bohr was somewhat naive to the science of spectroscopy even though at the time these Balmer lines were the obvious progression in his theory. Instead he went to look at Planck's constant, h, to try and integrate this quantity into his theory, hoping to find out more about the mysteries of energy within the atom. It was near impossible to measure the size of an atom using Rutherford's model, as the only two quantities involved were charge and mass. However, Planck's constant could be used to calculate some kind of rough-and-ready size of the atom, which was in a similar range to that found by scattering experiments etc. Bohr said that the electrons 'in orbit' around the nucleus of an atom stayed in place because they could not radiate energy continuously. However, they would be allowed to radiate a whole quantum of migrate from one energy level to another. By combining Balmer's equation and Planck's constant it meant that Bohr could calculate the possible energy levels permitted for the single electron in an atom of hydrogen, and the measured frequency of the spectral lines could now be interpreted as revealing how much energy difference there was between the different levels. Bohr's model of the atom also had another major string to its bow. By working outward through the electron shells and incorporating evidence from spectroscopy, he could explain the relationships between the elements in the periodic table in terms of atomic structure. Bohr reckoned that atoms combine and in such a way that they get as close as they can to making a closed outer shell. All chemical reactions can be explained in this way, as a sharing or swapping of electrons between atoms in a bid to achieve the stability of filled electron shells. Energy transitions involving outer electrons produce the characteristic spectral identification of an element. Bohr's model was confirmed by successful prediction of missing elements in the periodic table that had similar properties to other elements. This meant that Bohr's model of the atom and analysis of spectral lines could lead to the prediction and discovery of unknown elements. Soon, using Einstein's statistical ideas, Bohr was able to extend the model of his atom, taking on board the explanation that some lines in the spectrum are more pronounced than others because some transitions between energy states are more likely to happen. However, Bohr's model allowed many more spectral lines than can actually be seen in the light from different atoms, and discretional rules had to be brought in to say that some transitions between different energy states within the atom were forbidden. Also, new properties of the atom, quantum numbers, were consigned to fit the observations with no solid support of a theoretical foundation to justify why they were required, or why some transitions were forbidden. Bohr's model was quite frankly a bit of a mess despite the fact that it was brilliant in its simplicity and ability to smooth over the inequalities that made previous models so misunderstood. Bohr's combination of classical ideas and quantum theory was revolutionary but not a straightforward linear process. As Bohr incorporated new ideas and as the model began to evolve, more and more adjustments and fine-tuning was needed. This was left up to a very astute young gentleman from Germany called Arnold Somerfield. His involvement in the seemingly continuous updating and refining of Bohr's model was so much so that the model was often referred to as the 'Bohr-Sommerfield atom'. Even though the atom was effectively a combination of Bohr's brilliant imagination and classical physics ideas it lacked mathematical reasoning and a final, stable condition that meant it had to be adjusted after every new observation. It cannot be argued that Bohr's atom was a clear indication that quantum ideas had to be integrated into any respectable theory of atomic processes. It definitely made people think seriously about bringing quantum theory into the model of the atom and putting classical ideas on the back-burner for a while. Bohr's atom has made a huge impact on a huge range of people, firstly, on the scientists of the time who had trouble even talking about quantum theory and classical ideas in the same sentence, let alone accepting them as one of the most profound unified statements of the last century. A notable contributor to the theory was Albert Einstein who, in 916, introduced the idea of probability into the atomic theory, which eventually became the underpinning foundation of the true quantum theory. Secondly, there was the generation of scientists who had no previous knowledge of classical ideas and were able to tackle Bohr's model head-on and spend years refining it and further integrating the idea of quantum theory. These included now well-known scientists such as Paul Dirac and Wolfgang Pauli, among others. And lastly, there is everyone who has ever learnt basic chemistry at school or part of their general education. The Bohr model of the atom has since become 'accepted' by many educational bodies as the basis for understanding the basic ideas of molecular chemistry and chemical elements. This longevity stems from the fact that the classical orbital model is easy to visualise and is especially useful as a first version of the atom to teach to younger students. On the other hand, the flaws in his model as so obvious that they demand criticism and improvement. Many parts of the model are not backed up by rock solid foundations and are instead moments of sheer brilliance rather than a result of years of hard graft with classical Newtonian ideas. This has meant that his model has been open to opposition since day one and has not only gained recognition and interest as it has evolved, but it has also gained sceptical viewpoints from many leading scientists. However, I believe that constructive criticism and the subsequent improvement of a scientific theory are essential to its successful evolution and global recognition. Bohr's model may have been simplistic and rather 'bodged' together but it spurred on many other scientists and encouraged them to think about developing the existing model, such as Dirac and Pauli, or developing an alternative one of their own, challenging a view that had become front page news in the early parts of last century. If it wasn't for Bohr's brave attempt at incorporating two hugely massive and contrasting physical principles in explaining atomic processes, we may never have the complicated yet technically brilliant quantum development of the atom that we have today. It really boils down to whether you are prepared to accept that great physical ideas have flaws and whether you are prepared to ignore these in search of the bigger picture. Alternatively you might think it is better to exploit these existing defaults and slowly build up an alternative theory that gains momentum not from brilliant initiative or imagination but from the definite exclusion of previous 'grey areas' and ideas. I believe that the Bohr model of the atom has been useful despite its flaws. If you pick up any textbook or scientific publication today you will still find his model as the centrepiece of the explanation of atomic processes, despite the fact that we now understand the complexities involved and recognise that there is a lot more to the atom then a pretty picture of a nucleus and orbiting electrons. In its final form it represents just about the last model of the atom that bears any relation to the images we are used to in everyday life. Bohr's rough-and-ready approximation of atomic processes has allowed us to bridge the gap between Newtonian physics and atomic quantum ideas. Bohr's theory was famously recognised by Einstein as an, 'insecure and contradictory foundation', that appeared to him as a miracle in its significance to chemistry. Bohr's model proves that scientific idealism need not be perfect and need not be supplemented by mathematical vigour but instead, can be rooted firmly in the soul and passion of any upcoming scientist with the desire to succeed.""","""Evolution of atomic theory""","2177","""From the ancient Greeks to the present day, the evolution of atomic theory has been a story of intellectual curiosity, scientific rigor, and groundbreaking discoveries. The journey began in the 5th century BC with the Greek philosopher Democritus, who proposed the concept of atomos, indivisible particles that make up all matter. Although his ideas were purely speculative and lacked experimental evidence, they laid the foundation for future developments in atomic theory.  It wasn't until the 19th century that significant progress was made in understanding the nature of atoms. John Dalton, an English chemist, is credited with formulating the first modern atomic theory in the early 1800s. Dalton proposed that atoms are indivisible, indestructible particles that combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds. His theory explained the laws of chemical combination and provided a framework for understanding the behavior of matter.  As scientific knowledge advanced, so did the atomic theory. In the late 19th century, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron, a negatively charged subatomic particle, through his experiments using cathode ray tubes. This discovery challenged the notion of indivisible atoms and led to the development of the plum pudding model, which depicted electrons embedded in a positively charged sphere.  The early 20th century marked a revolutionary period in atomic theory with the work of Ernest Rutherford, whose gold foil experiment demonstrated that atoms have a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons. This discovery shattered the plum pudding model and gave rise to the planetary model of the atom, where electrons orbit the nucleus in discrete energy levels.  Building upon Rutherford's work, Niels Bohr introduced the concept of quantized energy levels and proposed the Bohr model of the atom, which described electrons moving in specific orbits around the nucleus. This model successfully explained the spectral lines of hydrogen and laid the groundwork for our current understanding of atomic structure.  The development of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century by scientists like Erwin Schrödinger and Werner Heisenberg further revolutionized atomic theory. Quantum mechanics described the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels, introducing wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle. This new framework provided a more accurate description of electron behavior within atoms.  The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 completed the picture of the modern atom, with a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons orbited by electrons. The neutron's presence explained isotopes and provided insight into nuclear reactions and the structure of atomic nuclei.  In the latter half of the 20th century, the development of quantum field theory and the Standard Model of particle physics further advanced atomic theory. Scientists identified a range of subatomic particles beyond protons, neutrons, and electrons, such as quarks, leptons, and bosons. The Standard Model successfully integrated the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces into a unified framework, explaining the interactions between particles at the most fundamental level.  Today, atomic theory continues to evolve with ongoing research in particle physics, quantum mechanics, and theoretical physics. Modern experiments using particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, probe the nature of matter at energies never before explored, seeking to unravel the mysteries of dark matter, dark energy, and the origins of the universe.  The journey of atomic theory from Democritus to the present day is a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. Each discovery, from the concept of indivisible atoms to the intricate structure of subatomic particles, has shaped our understanding of the universe and paved the way for technological advancements that have transformed society.  In conclusion, the evolution of atomic theory demonstrates the power of human curiosity and the scientific method in unraveling the mysteries of the natural world. As we continue to push the boundaries of scientific exploration, we may uncover new insights into the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces that govern the universe, pushing the frontiers of atomic theory even further.""","798"
"201","""Using an audio oscillator and pickup to induce oscillations, the standing waves produced in a fixed length of two different wires were investigated. The velocity of the waves on a thin wire was found to be from harmonic frequency measurements, which compares favourably to a value of calculated from a graph of frequency against harmonic number. Measurements of the fundamental frequency for increasing lengths of a thin wire described a proportional relationship between the fundamental frequency and the reciprocal of length, as predicted by theory. Measurements of the fundamental frequency for increasing applied tensions were made for both wires, and the velocity of the standing waves found to be proportional to the square root of the tension. The masses per unit length were found to be.8 x 0 - kg m - for the thin wire and.0 x 0 - kg m - for the thick wire, in agreement with the respective values of.2 x 0 - kg m - and.2 kg m - calculated from diameter measurements and a value for the density of steel of. g cm -. Measurement of the harmonic frequencies of a thick wire showed a deviation from the simple relationship predicted by basic theory, indicating that the elastic force was significant. Young's modulus for the thick wire was calculated to be.5/8 x Pa was calculated, in poor agreement with the accepted value for steel of.0 x Pa. - IntroductionA wave is any form of periodic disturbance of a medium that changes in form as time progresses. The medium itself does not travel on the macroscopic scale, but undergoes small scale vibrations and displacements from the normal position. These waves may be either longitudinal, along the direction of wave propagation, or transverse, at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, and the displacement of any point on the wave from its equilibrium position can be considered to vary simple harmonically with time. In this experiment we are primarily concerned with the common case of transverse waves on a taut string, although the case of longitudinal waves in an elastic rod will also be considered. Figure shows the basic case of a sinusoidal transverse wave on an infinitely long, taut string, with several common variables indicated. From these variables a general expression for the wave can be derived, of the form Or alternatively, in complex notation, The longitudinal velocity of the wave is given by In this experiment we are also interested in the transverse, or phase, velocity of the wave. This is the velocity of the transverse displacement of each point on the string from its equilibrium position. If the string experiences an applied tension T and has a mass per unit length m, then the transverse velocity of the given by This can be derived from first principles by considering the forces acting on an infinitesimal section of the string, but such a derivation is too long to present time progresses. The points on the standing wave at which the displacement is always zero are referred to as nodes, and are situated at half wavelength intervals. The midpoint between each pair of nodes is referred to as an antinode, and is the point at which the displacement of the standing wave varies periodically between a maximum and a minimum. The energy of the wave is a maximum at the antinodes but zero at the nodes, and so there is no net energy transfer along a standing wave as energy cannot be passed through the nodal positions. Compare this to a travelling wave which is, at one level, merely a method of transferring energy from one place to another. The concept of standing waves produced by reflection at one boundary can be further extended to the case where both ends of a string are fixed. This gives the string a fixed length, and means that the displacement of the string at both of its ends must always be zero. Combining equation with the definitions for and k provides an alternative expression for a sinusoidal travelling wave: Or Using this exponential form and the principle of superposition, remembering that the amplitude of one travelling wave is the negative amplitude of the other travelling wave, the exponential expression for a standing wave can be shown to be Or when the boundary condition y= at x= is considered. However there is another boundary condition imposed on this wave, namely y= at L=. Inserting this condition into the above expression gives or This limits the angular specific values given by where n is the number of the harmonic frequency These frequencies are known as the normal modes, or harmonic frequencies, of the vibrating string. One consequence of this expression, and of the boundary conditions, is that the string can only support whole numbers of half wavelengths. Hence the value of n is also the number of half wavelengths present on the string at that harmonic frequency. The case n= is referred to as the fundamental frequency of the string. Since there is no energy transfer in a standing wave, the string must be supplied with energy by an external source in order for it to oscillate. This external source can be, for example, plucking of the string, or the use of an audio oscillator attached to a pickup to produce sound waves which cause the string to vibrate when incident upon it. The damping effect of air resistance causes the string to lose energy as time progresses, and so the oscillations of the string will die away with time. In order to maintain the oscillation of the string a continuous input of energy is required, and hence the second method mentioned here is more useful for an extended investigation into the harmonic frequencies of a vibrating string. The waves produced by the pickup will produce forced oscillations of the same frequency in the string when incident upon it. This driving frequency will not necessarily coincide with one of the natural harmonic frequencies of the string, and if this is the case then the amplitude of the forced vibrations of the string will be very small. As the driving frequency approaches one of the natural harmonic frequencies, the vibrations of the string will begin to increase in amplitude, reaching a maximum when the driving frequency equals one of the natural harmonic frequencies of the string. This effect is known as resonance, and it is this effect that can be used to identify the harmonic frequencies of the wire as the peak in the amplitude of the forced oscillations can be easily detected. In order for this method to work satisfactorily, both the pickup and the device to measure the amplitude of the forced oscillations must be placed at antinodal positions along the wire. If the pickup is not placed in such a way then the standing wave will not be produced, or will have a smaller amplitude as the energy input would be partly at a nodal position where it cannot be used to produce a wave. Placing the detecting device at an antinodal position means that it receives the most powerful signal from the standing wave, and hence will be able to detect any amplitude changes more easily. Substituting the definition for into equation and rearranging leads to the expression This can be used as the basis for several investigations into the properties of standing wave harmonics. It can be seen from this expression that if the value of successive harmonic frequencies are measured whilst the length of the string is kept constant, then a graph of f n against n will yield a straight line through the origin with gradient. This allows the velocity of the waves on the wire to be calculated. It can also be seen that if the value of the fundamental frequency is measured for different wavelengths then a graph of f against should be a straight line through the origin. In both cases the string must be kept taut, as pure standing waves will only be produced if there is no slack in the string. Therefore the tension applied to the string must be sufficient for this to be the case, but should not be too large as applying too large a tension can cause nonlinear stretching of the wire to take place, which would also affect the form of the standing waves produced. The theory discussed so far assumes that the waves are being produced on a taut string. However there is no reason that a wire cannot be substituted for the string, as the basic theory remains unchanged. There is however one modification that must be made. Equation shows the simple relationship between tension, mass and velocity for waves produced on a taut string. When a wire is used instead of string to produce the standing waves, this relationship is only strictly true for completely flexible, ideal wires. Real wires experience another force in addition to the applied tension owing to the fact that they are, in effect, metal rods with a very small diameter. This extra force must be taken into account if an accurate description of the behaviour of the wire is to be produced. This extra force is known as the elastic force, and is responsible for the production of longitudinal waves in the solid rod or wire. This force is proportional to Young's modulus, E, which is specific to the particular material under investigation, and to the radius of the wire, r, to the fourth power. If this force is included in the description of the wire's behaviour then the equation for the velocity of the waves produced on the wire becomes This equation indicates that the velocity of the waves on the wire depends upon the wavelength of the waves, unlike equation which indicates no such dependence. This relationship is therefore a far more complex one than that shown previously. This equation can be combined with equation to eliminate v and, giving Considering the form of equation for the fundamental frequency gives. If it is assumed that, for the fundamental frequency, equation is a valid approximation then the square root term in equation can be substituted for this equation for the velocity of the fundamental frequency. The resulting equation can then be rearranged to give It can be seen from this expression that if the values of the harmonic frequencies of a thick wire, in which the elastic force is likely to be significant, are found whilst L and T are kept constant, then a graph of as a function of n should be the straight line until the elastic force becomes significant, at which the point the graph will become a straight line with gradient. If only these points are plotted then the graph becomes a straight line with gradient that has a y-axis intercept of. A value for E for the particular metal from which the wire is made can then be calculated from the value of the gradient of the graph. - Experimental Details2. General PointsThe experimental setup for all of the investigations is shown in figure. The wire was clamped in a fixed position at one end, and attached to a pivot from which masses could be hung at the other. The length of the wire under investigation was defined by the two moveable knife-edges, but note that as the wire was not fixed to the knife-edges these points only approximate to nodes. However the approximation required can be ignored for the course of this experiment. Forced oscillations in this length of wire, forming standing waves, were produced by an audio oscillator attached to a pickup positioned on the magnetic strip underneath the wire. This pickup will henceforth be referred to as the 'driver'. The oscillator output was connected to both the Y input of the oscilloscope and the frequency meter. A second pickup, henceforth referred to as the 'detector', was connected to the Y input of the oscilloscope, allowing the oscilloscope to compare the signals from the driver and detector in order to produce the waveform on the scope. The driving frequency was controlled by altering the oscillator output frequency, which could be varied using an analogue dial on the external casing of the audio oscillator. This dial had a range of. to 1 with a multiplicative factor of 0, 00, 000, 0k, or 00 kHz, and increased the frequency in a logarithmic fashion. The oscillations of the wire were picked up by the detector, and translated into a waveform on the oscilloscope screen, the amplitude of which could be changed by varying the amplitude of the audio signal produced by the oscillator using the 'fine amplitude' analogue dial on its outer casing. The speed at which the waveform moved across the oscilloscope screen could be changed by altering the time-base of the oscilloscope. This was set at a value such that the waveform appeared stationary. The tension in the wire was controlled using the pivoting system shown in figure. For a body in static equilibrium That is, the sum of the torques on the body must equal zero. Since the magnitude of the torque is the magnitude of the force, F, multiplied by the perpendicular distance, l, between the point at which the force acts and the pivot: From figure this gives, which can be rearranged to give Hence the requisite maximum and minimum masses for each investigation could be calculated from the suggested tension ranges in, and the masses required for a suitable number and range of readings could be decided upon. For the equipment set being used, x =.20m and l =.80m. The harmonic frequencies were found in one of two ways depending on the particular investigation being carried out. The first method, used for all investigations, was to slowly increase the oscillator output, noting the value at which the amplitude of the oscilloscope signal was a maximum whilst still remaining a pure sinusoidal wave. When using this method it was found that listening to the wire helped to locate this frequency, as the resonance of the wire at the harmonic frequencies, particularly when using the thin wire produced an audible hum. The y-divisions setting on the oscilloscope could be altered in order to make the trace appear larger, allowing the change in amplitude at the harmonic frequencies to be seen more clearly. If the trace was not a pure sinusoid, indicating a superposition of more than one harmonic frequency, then the amplitude of the oscillator output frequency was varied or the frequency itself was changed slightly in order to give the purely sinusoidal signal sought. The frequency was then evaluated using the frequency meter, with the range set so as to give the maximum possible precision of reading whilst still allowing readings to be readily taken. Whilst testing the equipment it was decided to take the frequency readings using the frequency meter rather than the oscilloscope when using this method, as it was felt that the frequency meter would be more accurate. Using the oscilloscope required the estimation of the number of scale division that were equal to one wavelength of the trace, and it was felt that this would be inaccurate owing to the inherent thickness of the trace signal. Hence all values for the harmonic frequencies were recorded from the frequency meter. The second method for finding the harmonic frequencies, used for the first investigation only, involved using the Lissajous figures produced by the comparison of the signals from the driver and detector by the oscilloscope. In order to view the Lissajous figures, the oscilloscope timebase was switched to the X-Y position. When the wire was vibrating normally, the Lissajous figure produced was not steady, fluctuating in size, orientation, and in the width of the figure. The frequency was then increased from zero until the Lissajous figure became a stationary circle or ellipse. The successive frequencies at which this occurred gave the values of the corresponding harmonic frequencies. The frequency was then read off from the frequency meter, as the oscilloscope timebase could not be used to estimate the frequency in this case due to the circular nature of the Lissajous figures.. Investigation into the harmonic frequencies of a thin wireThe length of the thin wire was set to be.00707m, as this was the maximum length that could be conveniently used. The position measurements for the two knife-edges used to define the length were made using a fixed metre rule with well defined, regularly sized divisions, and the knife-edge stands had a clear, well defined edge. The metal knife-edges were also placed on a magnetic strip, and so were not free to move. It was felt that the combination of these factors meant that the error in each position measurement was.mm, leading to the error in the length given above when the two position measurements were combined. gives the tension required for this investigation as -N, but it was felt that this was insufficient tension to keep the wire taut. Therefore a mass of 00g was used to provide a tension of.24N. The error in T was not evaluated in this case, as the value of T played no part in the analysis of the results. The driver and detector were initially positioned in the centre of the wire in order to place them at the antinode of the fundamental vibrations of the wire. The frequency of the oscillator was then slowly increased from zero, and the value of the fundamental frequency determined using both methods outlined above. These values were used to predict the values of successive harmonics, and the actual frequency values for the nd to 0 th harmonics were found using both methods outlined above. Before each new harmonic was found the positions of the driver and detector were changed so that they were always in antinodal positions, but as close to the centre of the wire and each other as possible. As the number of antinodes increased it was found that this often required placing them in adjacent antinodal positions, as the distance / decreased to the point where it was not possible to place the two stands under the same antinode owing to their finite size. The frequency meter was set to the kHz scale and three decimal places range for this investigation, as it was felt that this gave the best balance between precision and ease of use. Increasing the number of decimal places increases the precision of the reading, but also increased the time taken for the frequency meter reading to settle. It also made the meter more sensitive to small changes in frequency. Hence dp was chosen as a compromise, whilst the kHz scale was chosen due to the magnitude of the frequencies being used. It was noted whilst this investigation was underway that the detector was very sensitive to interference caused by background noise. To try and minimise this effect, spurious noise was kept to minimum and readings were only taken when the area around the experiment was clear of people. The frequency readings were also only taken after it was certain that the frequency meter reading had settled on the frequency for the harmonic just found. Investigation into the relationship between the fundamental frequency of a thin wire and it's lengthThe tension set for this investigation was.24N (see section. for the reasoning behind this). Again, no error evaluation for this value was made as the value of T played no part in the analysis of the results. An initial experiment was carried out to determine whether it would be better to increase or decrease the length of the wire, and to find out the number of readings that could feasibly be taken. It was found that increasing the wire's length made the fundamental frequency of each length slightly easier to find, and it was therefore decided to find the values of the fundamental frequencies for increasing length. The increase in length between readings was set as.5/8m, as this seemed to give a large number of results for the length range used whilst maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy. The smallest length that could be used was dictated by the width of the driver and detector stands, which were.27m thick each. The finite size of these components meant that the smallest length that could be used was.0m. The maximum feasible length was unchanged from the previous investigation, and hence the evaluation of the error in L was unchanged as the method of measurement remained the same. Therefore eleven readings from.00707m to.00707m were taken. To increase the length each knife-edge was moved.25/8m from its previous position towards the end of the metre rule. The knife-edges were kept equidistant from the centre of the wire at all times, as this maximised the proportion of the energy provided by the driver that was actually used to oscillate the length of wire under investigation. The fundamental frequency for each length was found using the first method outlined above, with the same attention to minimising background noise. It was found that listening and watching the wire were especially helpful when trying to find the points of resonance, as the amplitude of the oscillations of the wire could visibly be seen to increase and a humming noise could be heard. Investigation into the relationship between the velocity of standing waves on a wire and the applied tensionBoth the thick and thin wires were used for this investigation. The length of each wire was set to the maximum possible length as found in previous investigations. See section. for details of the evaluation of the error in L. When using the thin wire it was advised that the maximum tension used should be no more than 0N in order to prevent the wire from snapping under the tension. This corresponded to a mass of approximately 00g, and so a maximum mass of 00g was chosen in order to provide a safety margin. Using equation therefore gives the maximum tension applied as 5/8.96N. It was decided to increase the mass in 0g increments, starting from the minimum possible mass of 0g in order to give a sufficient quantity of data. This gave a total of eight readings over a tension range of.62 to 5/8.96N, which were taken in order of ascending mass. When using the thick wire it was advised that the tension range should be between 5/8 and 0N. The masses corresponding to these tensions were calculated, and then the maximum and minimum masses used taken to be the nearest convenient values. This gave a mass range of 00g to kg, and a tension range of 5/8.0 to 9.4N. It was decided to increase the mass in 00g increments in order to ensure that the quantity of data acquired was the same for the two wires. The error in T was calculated using a partial derivative formulation of equation X. Hence the error in T depended upon the evaluation of the errors in l and x. These quantities were found using a standard ruler, with clear, well defined and regularly sized divisions. It was felt that the magnitudes of l and x could be found quite accurately in this fashion, and so the error in each quantity was evaluated as.mm. This led to an error in T of.45/8m. The diameters of the wires were found using an analogue micrometer. Since the wire diameters would not necessarily be identical at all points on the wires, several readings were taken at regular intervals, and the diameter taken to be the average value. The micrometer was carefully zeroed before each reading was taken in order to eliminate the 'zero error' as a possible systematic error source. The micrometer is a very accurate and precise piece of equipment, and so the error in the measurements of the wire diameters was evaluated to be.005/8mm, or half of the smallest significant figure to which the micrometer could measure. Investigation into the effect of Young's Modulus on the harmonic frequencies of a thick wireThe length of the thick wire was set to be.0707m in the centre of the length of wire for the reasons outlined in section. Refer to section. for details of the evaluation of the error in L. states that a tension of approximately 5/8N should be used. However it was advised that a tension of 0N would be more appropriate for the set of equipment being used. This corresponds to a mass of approximately 5/80g by equation, and so this was the mass used, giving a precise tension value of.1N The values of the harmonic frequencies were then found using the first method outlined in section. It was noted that the values of the harmonic frequencies were very hard to find, particularly as n increased. Several attempts had to be made to find some of the harmonics, and so the number of each harmonic could not be confirmed until the investigation was complete. It was found that the precise position of each harmonic frequency depended on whether the frequency was being increased or decreased approaching the resonance point, and that decreasing the frequency seemed to provide more accurate results. The harmonic frequencies were therefore found by decreasing the frequency in the vicinity of the resonance point. Listening for the rise in volume of the note produced by the vibrating wire proved particularly helpful when finding the resonance points during this investigation, as at higher frequencies the amplitude peak of the oscilloscope trace was often small. It was also noticeable that the frequency meter readings seemed to fluctuate over a much greater range during this investigation than during previous investigations. - Results3. Investigation into the harmonic frequencies of a thin wireFigure is a graph of f n as a function of n for the thin wire, on which are plotted the data obtained through observations of the oscilloscope trace, as it was felt that these data were more reliable than the data obtained through observations of the Lissajous figures. No intercept point has been plotted, as the th harmonic should occur at Hz. The gradient of the graph is, and a least mean squares plot using the graph plotting package 'Origin' gives a value of The intercept of the line on the f n axis is -., which is significantly different from the value of zero expected. There is very little scattering of the points about the line of best fit, and so a linear fit to the data set seems completely appropriate. The error bars are very small, but visible, and are all intersected by the line of best fit. Since the error bars are so small, and the correlation of the plotted points with the line of best fit is so good, the error bars are consistent with the data. Investigation into the relationship between the fundamental frequency of a wire and it's lengthFigure is a graph of f as a function of, on which are plotted the data obtained from the measurement of the fundamental frequency of the thin wire at increasing lengths. No intercept point has been plotted, as the fundamental frequency of a wire of length zero should be Hz, and so the graph should pass through the origin. The graph is a straight line of constant gradient, and hence demonstrates that the velocity of the standing waves is proportional to the reciprocal of the length of the wire. The correlation of the data points with the line of best fit is excellent as the line appears to pass directly through almost all of the data points, and hence a linear fit to the data is appropriate. The small size of the error bars is consistent with this correlation, and every set of error bars is intersected by the line of best fit. Investigation into the relationship between the velocity of the waves on a wire and the applied tensionFigure shows a graph of v as a function of T / for the thin wire on which are plotted the velocities calculated from the measurement of the fundamental frequency for increasing tension. Equation X predicts that the graph should be a straight line through the origin, and so no intercept point has been plotted. The gradient of the graph is, and a least mean squares fit using the graph plotting package 'Origin' leads to a value for the mass per unit length of the thin wire of Figure shows a graph of v as a function of T / for the thick wire on which are plotted the velocities calculated from the measurement of the fundamental frequency for increasing tension. Equation predicts that the graph should be a straight line through the origin, and so no intercept point has been plotted. The gradient of the graph is, and a least mean squares fit using the graph plotting package 'Origin' leads to a value for the mass per unit length of the wire The scattering of the points about the line of best fit appears to be randomly above and below the line for both graphs, and so a linear fit seems appropriate for both data sets. The error bars on figure are very small but still visible, and the majority of them are intersected by the line of best fit. The size of the error bars seems consistent with the standard deviation of the graph. Every set of error bars on figure is intersected by the line of best fit, and the size of the y-error bars seems consistent with the y-distance between the plotted data and the line of best fit. However the x-error bars appear to be too large for the quality of the correlation obtained. Investigation into the effect of Young's Modulus on the velocity of standing waves in a thick wireFigure 0 shows a graph of as a function of n on which are plotted the data calculated from the measurements of the th to 5/8 th harmonic frequencies of a thick wire. Equation predicts that the graph should be a straight line with an intercept on the y-axis of one. The gradient of this graph is, and a least mean squares fit using the graph plotting package 'Origin' gives a value of The scattering of the points about the line of best fit does not seem entirely random. The readings at either extremity are positioned below the line whilst the central data points are above the line, a pattern which suggests a slight curve to the data set. It might be that a curved fit might be more appropriate, but a linear fit has been used in order to facilitate the analysis of the data. The error bars are clearly visible on the graph and all but one set are intersected by the line of best fit, but it is noticeable that the error bars are considerably longer than the average distance in the y-direction between the plotted points and the line of best fit. - DiscussionInvestigation into the harmonic frequencies of a thin wireEquation predicts that a graph of f n as a function of n for the thin wire should be a straight line through the origin with gradient. When plotted the experimental data do lie along a straight line within experimental error, but the intercept of the graph with the y-axis is -. and so it cannot be considered to pass through the origin. The value of the intercept is small compared to the value of the gradient however, and so the theory discussed in the introduction can be applied in reasonable confidence in order to calculate the velocity of the standing waves on the thin wire. This gives a value of A second value for this velocity can be calculated from the value of each harmonic frequency using This gives a wave velocity for each harmonic frequency, and the average velocity for the harmonic frequencies can be calculated. This is found to be These values do not agree, but they are very similar. This seems to suggest that equation can be applied to a thin wire in which the elastic force is negligible, but only as an approximation as noted in the introduction. The uncertainty in the value of v calculated from the graph arises from the uncertainties in the gradient, and hence in f n, and in L, whilst the error in the value of v calculated from the harmonic frequencies depends on the errors in f and. The disagreement between the two values of v suggests that there may have been an initial misevaluation of one of these uncertainties. The error in the value of L was evaluated to be.07mm, owing to an error in the position measurement of each knife-edge of.mm. It is possible that this evaluation was slightly optimistic, but the error in each position measurement could not be more than.mm, as the divisions on the rule were uniform in size and clearly defined, whilst the clearly defined edges of the knife-edges provided a precise measurement point. If the error in the measurements at either end of the length was indeed.mm, then the error in L becomes.1mm. Taking this increase in the error in L into account, the error in the value of v obtained from the graph can be recalculated. This gives a new value of The error in f n was evaluated as.Hz, as the frequency meter reading was felt to be highly accurate and the readings given by the meter did not fluctuate very much. It was felt that, due to the instability of the Lissajous figures, the error in the frequency readings taken from the Lissajous' would be much larger, possibly up to.Hz due to the difficulties encountered when attempting to locate the frequency at which the Lissajous figure became stable. This decision, as well as the assessment of the error in the frequency meter readings used, seems to be justified when viewed in the context of figure X, as the size of the error bars is entirely consistent with the quality of the correlation obtained. The fractional error in is the same as the fractional error in L, as is merely a multiple or factor of the length of the wire. Hence the re-evaluation of the error in L affects the error in as well. Since the evaluation of the error in f n appears justified, this means that the re-evaluation of the error in v frequencies will be affected only by the change in the error in L. This recalculation leads to a value of Note that the change in L was not great enough to affect the error in v after rounding. These re-evaluations do not bring the two values of v into agreement, but increasing the random error in L to a value greater than.mm would seem to contradict the accuracy to which the value of L could be measured using the available equipment. It is unlikely that the error in L was greater than this value therefore, and so it appears that there was a source of systematic error present in the experiment that was not initially identified. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the graph has a negative intercept on the y-axis, when theory predicts that it should pass through the origin. The most likely source of systematic error is in the measurement of the harmonic frequencies. It was noted in section. that the oscilloscope trace was very sensitive to interference caused by background noise such as the movement of people around the laboratory, or the proximity of a conversation to the experiment. Every effort was made to keep this interference to a minimum, but it was not possible to eliminate it entirely. This interference would affect the values obtained for f n, hence affecting the intercept of the graph and both of the values of v obtained. Another possible source of systematic error, again linked to the frequency values, is the possibility that the driver and detector were not placed in the optimal positions to produce the maximum resonance amplitude of the forced oscillations of the wire. This would reduce the intensity of the signal transmitted to the oscilloscope, making it harder to find the harmonic frequencies and possibly leading to a misjudgement of their positions. It is unlikely that this was the case however, as before each reading was taken the necessary positions of the driver and detector were calculated, and the two units carefully positioned in order to eliminate this possible source of error. It is also unlikely that this would give an error to each reading of a magnitude such that the overall correlation was so good. A third possible source of systematic error relates to the experimental setup. It was noted in section. that the knife-edges, and the driver and detector stands, were positioned on a magnetic strip in order to ensure that they did not slip whilst the experiment was in progress (this measure itself eliminates a possible systematic error source). This magnetic strip would produce a magnetic field, which would interact with the wire and induce a current in the wire as it vibrated. This induced current would in turn affect the oscillations of the wire. However it was felt that the magnetic strip was sufficiently weak and at a sufficient distance from the wire that the interactions between the field and the wire would be of negligible magnitude, and so this possible source of error can be discounted. Investigation into the relationship between the fundamental frequency of a wire and it's lengthEquation predicts that a graph of f as a function of should be a straight line through the origin. When plotted the experimental data do lie along a straight line within experimental error, but the graph intercepts the y-axis at -.6, in conflict with the predictions of theory. The value of the intercept is small compared to the value of the gradient however, and so the theory discussed in the introduction can be applied in reasonable confidence. The theory predicts that the harmonic frequency of an oscillating wire should be proportional to the reciprocal of the length of the wire. The straight line graph obtained for this investigation confirms this prediction, but only for a thin wire in which the magnitude of the elastic force is negligible. The error in the gradient of the graph depends on the errors in f and L. The excellent correlation between the plotted data and the line of best fit, and the appropriate size of the error bars in figure suggest that the initial evaluation of these errors was correct. This is interesting, as the evaluation of the error in L was the same as the evaluation for the previous investigation, in which it seemed that the error in L had been underestimated. However the re-evaluation of the error in L to its maximum feasible value had little effect on the agreement between the two velocity values obtained in the previous investigation, and so it may be that the initial evaluation of the error in L was in fact correct. This supports the conclusion that a systematic error was present in the previous investigation. Although the linear correlation seen in figure supports the theory behind the investigation, the fact that there is a y-intercept value suggests that there was a systematic error acting on the system that was not initially identified. It is interesting to note that the value of the intercept in figure is very similar to the value of the intercept in figure. This suggests that a similar systematic error was acting in both cases, since both are investigations into linear relationships. It is therefore likely that the intercept value of the graph is due to a systematic error caused by interference originating from background noise. It is interesting to note that, with one exception, the resonance points in this investigation were generally easier to find than in the previous investigation. This may have been due to the fact that this was the second investigation carried out, and substantial experience had been gained in the used to find the resonance points. The one exception was the resonance for L =.0m, which was extremely difficult to find. It is unlikely however that this difficulty was sufficient to produce a result that deviated from the correct value by a magnitude sufficient to produce the intercept seem in figure whilst maintaining the quality of correlation observed. Investigation into the relationship between the fundamental frequency of a wire and the applied tensionEquation states that a graph of v as a function of T / should be a straight line through the origin with gradient, assuming that the magnitude of the elastic force in the wire is negligible. When plotted, the experimental data for both wires do lie along a straight line within experimental error. However, both figure and figure have y-intercept values. In both cases the magnitude of the intercept is small compared to the magnitude of the gradient however, and so equation can still be applied to both sets of data in order to determine whether the elastic force is significant in either wire. The value of m for the thin wire obtained from figure is which agrees very favourably with the value calculated using the diameter measurements and a value for the density of mild steel of. This calculated value is The value of m for the thick wire obtained from figure is which agrees with the value calculated using the diameter measurements and a value for the density of mild steel of. This calculated value is The uncertainties in the values of m obtained from the graphs depend upon the uncertainties in the values of r and the gradient, and hence depend upon the errors in f, and T. The evaluation of the error in f has already been discussed in section. above, and since the frequency meter readings were once again reasonably steady there is no apparent justification for changing this error evaluation. The error in is dependant on the error in L as stated in section. above. The re-evaluation of this error carried out in that section has been taken into account in the calculations of the errors in the different values of m, as any error re-evaluation affects all results calculated using that value. since neither the error in nor the error in f has been re-evaluated, the error in v is judged to be of an acceptable magnitude. This assessment is supported by the size of the error bars on figures and, as in both cases the size of the y-error bars seems consistent with the standard deviation of the graph. The error in T depends on the errors in the values of l and x (see figure ). The error in these quantities was evaluated to be.mm, as they were measured using a standard ruler with clear, well-defined and regularly sized divisions and it was felt that this was the level of accuracy that could be obtained using this method. These evaluations seem justified when the size of the T / error bars on each graph are considered. In both cases the error bars seem consistent with the average distance along the x-axis between the plotted data points and the line of best fit; although in the case of figure they could be deemed to be slightly large. However it is felt that this was the maximum accuracy that could be obtained using the method used to measure x and l, and hence the error in T / will not be re-evaluated. The value of r was calculated from the measurements of the wire diameters that were made using an analogue micrometer. This piece of equipment is highly accurate and precise, and so the error in the value of d, and hence r, was evaluated to be.005/8mm. There is no apparent reason to change this evaluation given the excellent agreement between the two calculated values of m for each wire. It is interesting to note that the two values of m for the thick wire agree so well. Equation is only strictly true for wires in which the magnitude of the elastic force is negligible. The excellent agreement suggests that the magnitude of the elastic force in the thick wire is negligible when considering the fundamental frequency, although it may become a factor at higher harmonic frequencies. An alternative explanation is that the same systematic error that produced the y-intercept also acted on the values of f obtained in such a way as to produce the agreement between the two values of m, although this seems unlikely. Investigation into the effect of Young's Modulus on the speed of standing waves in a thick wireEquation predicts that a graph of as a function of n should be a straight line with gradient and a y-intercept of provided that equation is a valid approximation for the fundamental frequency. This can be assumed to be the case from the results discussed in section. The graph will only be valid for n greater than approximately, as up to this point the magnitude of the elastic force is small as seen in the previous investigation for the fundamental frequency. In this case the values of f n began to deviate substantially from the values predicted using the fundamental frequency at, and so only data from the harmonics has been used to plot figure. The plotted data do lie along a straight line to within experimental error, but the appropriateness of the linear fit is questionable as the data points seem to form a shallow curve. Despite this, the value of the intercept on the y-axis is.43, close to the value of predicted by the theory. The theory discussed in the introduction will therefore be applied to the data in order to determine a value for Young's modulus, E, for the thick wire, but the conclusions reached will not necessarily be valid owing to the aforementioned questionability of the linear fit. The value of E calculated from the gradient of the graph is This agrees poorly with the accepted value for steel of.0 x Pa. This poor agreement suggests that there has been an overoptimistic evaluation of one or more of the random errors acting on the system. The error in E depends on the errors in the gradient, and hence in f n, and the errors in r, L, and T. the error in r has already been discussed in previous sections, as have the errors in L and T. The errors in T and r were judged to have been evaluated correctly, and the error in L was re-evaluated. This re-evaluation has been taken into account when calculating the error in the value of E quoted above. Therefore it seems as though the error in f n must have been misevaluated. During this investigation, the values of f n were much more difficult to find than in previous investigations as noted in section. The frequency meter readings were also observed to fluctuate over a wider range than in previous investigations, again as noted in section. These two factors led to a re-evaluation of the error in f n from previous investigations. It was felt that the combination of the two factors outlined in the previous paragraph led to a range of frequencies in which each harmonic could lie of approximately Hz. It was therefore decided that the error in the values of f n obtained should be.Hz, or half of the possible range of frequencies within which f n could lie. Figure 0 was plotted using this initial re-evaluation of the error in f n. However the discrepancy between the accepted value of E and the value obtained suggests that the error in f n must be re-evaluated once more. The error in the value of E obtained through experimentation must be larger if the two values are to agree, suggesting that the re-evaluation of the error in f n was still too low. However if the size of the y-error bars on figure 0 is considered, it appears that the error in f n has been overestimated as the error bars appear too large for the standard deviation of the graph. Since these two factors directly contradict one another, it must be concluded that the evaluation of the error in the values of f n was in fact reasonable. Therefore the discrepancy between the calculated and accepted values of E is likely to be due to a systematic error. A possible source of this systematic error is the way in which the harmonic frequencies were found. It is stated in section. that the values of the harmonic frequencies appeared to be different depending on whether the frequency was being increased or decreased in the vicinity of the resonance, and that it was decided to obtain all of the results by decreasing the local frequency. It is possible that this was the wrong decision, and that the values obtained through the increase of the frequency in the vicinity of the harmonic frequency would have yielded a more accurate value of E. Why this might be the case is not certain, but it is a possibility that must be considered. Another factor that might have produced a systematic error was the interference caused by background noise. This was a particular problem during this experiment as the amplitude peaks in the oscilloscope trace were often very small, and would therefore have been swamped by background noise. Listening to the wire would have helped in this situation, but would not have completely compensated for this effect. Although plausible, it is unlikely that this possibility is the source of the systematic error, as particular care was taken to minimise the amount of background noise, and to try and take results during quiet moments, in this investigation, as it was recognised that it would be a particular problem once the small magnitude of the amplitude peaks was realised. A third possibility is that the driver and detector were not in the optimal positions along the length of wire under consideration in order to cause and detect forced oscillations in the wire. The driver and detector were not moved from their starting positions during the course of this experiment, and it was only once the investigation was concluded that this was realised. In order to produce a pure standing wave pattern, the driver must be positioned in an antinodal position, and the detector must be in a similar position in order to pick up any changes in the forced oscillations. The wire length used,.5/8m, would have resulted in movements of the driver and detector of only a few centimetres each time, but it might have been an important factor in the quality of results obtained. This might also explain the shallow curve to the data plotted on figure 0, as the antinodal positions would have moved away from the driver and detector before moving towards them again as the value of n increased and the number of half-wavelengths within the length of wire under investigation increased. Once the difficulties involved in the location of the harmonic frequencies using the first method outlined in section. had become apparent, or once the full set of data had been taken, it might have been prudent to attempt to find the harmonic frequencies again using the second method involving Lissajous figures outlined in section. Although the Lissajous figures would have been very unstable due to the highly sensitive nature of the equipment during this investigation, and hence the frequencies would still have been hard to find, this would have provided a second set of data and allowed any possible anomalous results to be identified. It might also have proved to be slightly easier to find frequencies at which the Lissajous figures became stationary than to find the frequencies at which the oscilloscope trace underwent a very small amplitude increase.. General pointsThe experimental setup was generally sufficient for the investigations being undertaken, but the sensitivity of the frequency meter and oscilloscope sometimes became very problematic. In order to try and compensate for this sensitivity, the experiment could be carried out in isolation. Performing the experiment in a separate room would help to minimise the effects of background noise on the frequency meter reading and oscilloscope trace. The other problem encountered whilst carrying out these investigations was the small magnitude of the amplitude peaks in the oscilloscope traces observed at the harmonic frequencies, which often made the harmonic frequencies quite difficult to pinpoint. As mentioned in section. this might have been offset by utilising the Lissajous figures for the final investigation. However in general it is difficult to see how this problem could be addressed without substantial changes to the experimental method, although the use of a more precise audio oscillator might help. Improving the resolution of the oscilloscope might also go some way towards addressing the problem. - ConclusionBy setting the length of a thin wire to a constant.00.00707m and measuring its harmonic frequencies, a value for the speed of the waves on the wire of was found. This compared favourably to the value of found through direct calculations utilising the basic relationship between frequency, wavelength and velocity. The initial evaluation of the error in the frequency readings was judged to be correct, but the original evaluation of the error in L was judged to have been an underestimation. The subsequent corrected value for the error in m was still insufficient to account for the discrepancy in the value of v, and so a systematic error owing to the interference caused by background noise was suggested. Systematic errors owing to misplacement of the driver and detector, and due to the magnetic field of the small magnetic strip were considered, but dismissed. By measuring the fundamental frequency of the thin wire for increasing lengths of wire, it was shown that the fundamental frequency of the wire was proportional to the reciprocal of the length of the wire, as predicted by theory. However the straight line did not pass through the origin, contradicting the predictions of theory, and so a systematic error arising from interference owing to background noise was once again suggested. By measuring the fundamental frequency of a fixed length of both the thin and thick wires for increasing applied tensions, values for the mass per unit lengths of both wires of.10.8x10 -kgm - and.30.0x10 -kgm - respectively were found, in excellent agreement with the values of.80.2x10 -kgm - and.00.2x10 -kgm - calculated from the measurements of the wire diameters and a value for the density of steel of. The initial evaluations of the errors in T and r were judged to be correct, and the re-evaluated error in the value of L was judged to be appropriate for this investigation as well as for the first investigation. By setting the length of the thick wire to.5/80.00707m and measuring its harmonic frequencies, the point at which the values of the harmonic frequencies began to deviate from the standard linear relationship was found. By plotting a graph of f n against n for these harmonics, a value for Young's modulus of.71.5/8x10 1Pa was found, in poor agreement with the accepted value for steel of.0x10 1Pa. The errors in L (as re-evaluated), r and T were judged to have been evaluated correctly, but the appropriateness of the evaluation of the error in f n could not be assessed Possible systematic errors owing to the method used to find the harmonic frequencies, and to interference caused by background noise were suggested.""","""Standing Waves and Harmonic Frequencies""","10527","""Standing waves and harmonic frequencies are fundamental concepts in physics and are integral to understanding the behavior of waves in various systems. These phenomena play a crucial role in fields ranging from music and acoustics to engineering and quantum mechanics. In this comprehensive exploration, we will delve into the intricate details of standing waves, harmonic frequencies, their properties, applications, and significance across different disciplines.  To begin, let's define standing waves. Standing waves are a type of wave pattern that results from the interference of two waves traveling in opposite directions within the same medium. Unlike traveling waves, which propagate through a medium, standing waves oscillate in place, appearing as stationary patterns of nodes and antinodes. Nodes are points along the medium where the displacement of the wave is always zero, while antinodes are points of maximum displacement.  The formation of standing waves is governed by specific conditions related to the wavelength of the waves and the geometry of the medium. For standing waves to occur, the waves must have the same frequency and wavelength, allowing them to interfere constructively and destructively, leading to the formation of stable patterns. This phenomenon is commonly observed in systems such as strings, pipes, and membranes, where waves reflect back and forth, establishing standing wave patterns.  One key characteristic of standing waves is their association with harmonic frequencies. Harmonic frequencies, also known as overtones or harmonics, are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency of a vibrating system. The fundamental frequency is the lowest resonant frequency at which an object vibrates, and harmonics are integral multiples of this base frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency of a system is f, the second harmonic would be 2f, the third harmonic 3f, and so on.  The relationship between standing waves and harmonic frequencies is significant in understanding the behavior of waves in different systems. In systems that support standing waves, such as strings and pipes, the harmonic frequencies determine the possible modes of vibration that the system can exhibit. Each harmonic corresponds to a specific mode of vibration with a characteristic nodal pattern, influencing the overall resonance properties of the system.  In musical instruments, the concept of harmonic frequencies governs the timbre or quality of sound produced. The presence and relative amplitudes of harmonic frequencies contribute to the unique tonal characteristics of different musical instruments. By manipulating the harmonic content of a sound wave, musicians can create a rich variety of tones and textures, enhancing the expressive potential of music.  Moreover, standing waves and harmonic frequencies have practical applications in engineering and technology. For instance, in acoustics, the resonance of standing waves in enclosed spaces like concert halls and auditoriums can be optimized to improve sound quality and distribution. By designing spaces that minimize unwanted reflections and standing wave patterns, engineers can create environments that enhance the listening experience for audiences.  In the field of telecommunications, understanding standing waves and harmonic frequencies is crucial for designing efficient antennas and communication systems. Antennas operate based on resonance principles, where standing waves are used to transmit and receive electromagnetic signals effectively. By selecting appropriate frequencies and optimizing antenna design, engineers can maximize signal strength and transmission range.  In addition to classical wave phenomena, standing waves and harmonic frequencies have implications in quantum mechanics and particle physics. Quantum systems, such as electrons in an atom, exhibit standing wave behavior described by wave functions, which determine the probability distribution of finding particles in different states. The quantization of energy levels in quantum systems is intimately connected to the concept of standing waves and their harmonic modes.  Furthermore, the study of standing waves and harmonic frequencies extends to other branches of science, including geophysics, where seismic waves generated by earthquakes exhibit standing wave patterns in the Earth's crust. By analyzing the resonant frequencies of the Earth, geophysicists can infer valuable information about the composition and structure of the planet's interior, aiding in seismic exploration and earthquake monitoring.  In summary, standing waves and harmonic frequencies are fundamental phenomena that underpin the behavior of waves in diverse systems and disciplines. From music and acoustics to engineering and quantum mechanics, these concepts offer profound insights into the nature of wave propagation and resonance. By exploring the properties, applications, and significance of standing waves and harmonic frequencies, we gain a deeper appreciation of the intricate interplay between waves and the physical world around us.""","858"
"355","""The essay examines the operation of the 'Leniency Notice' as a weapon to destabilise the effects of Cartels which are prohibited by Articles 1 and 2 of the EC treaty or Sections and of the Sherman Act. The essay will begin by giving a definition of the 'European Commissions' Leniency Notice and Cartels followed by a concise discussion of the difficulty of detecting and proving the existence of a cartel which consumers must view in light of the 'leniency notice'. The essay will attempt to address the issues derived from the policy objectives of imposing penalties on those individuals who commit an offence but in effect are not penalised. This essay will address more specifically the operation of the notice in the EU 'although reference will be made to the US antitrust laws where appropriate given its increasing influence in a domestic and EC context.' The Commissions notice was firstly introduced in 996. However, it was revised and issued in February 002 as it was seen that the notice clearly 'did not emulate the 'DOJ' success in a number of respects.' Therefore, the essay will most importantly discuss the limitations of the operation of the EC notice in light of the successes of the 'United States' notice. Nevertheless, despite its limitations its successes so far are promising and undeniably models as a weapon for the beginning of the destruction of cartels. The essay will conclude that the operation of the notice may still have to be improved before it can be as successful as the US notice. Commission notice on immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel P.Ewing, Competition rules for the 1st century,, First Edition, Kluwer Law International A.Jones and B.Sufrin, EC Competition Law,, Second Edition, Oxford University Press, at p788 URL and See case of 'Woodpulp' J. D. Hunter and S. Hornsby, 'New Incentives for Whistle blowing': Will the E.C.Commissions Notice Bear Fruit' E.C.L.R. 997, notice on immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel, 'a third party injured by the cartels actions may commence civil proceedings' against that undertaking before their own national courts and plaintiffs may also 'rely on evidence drawn from the commission in their plea.' This was evident in the 'vitamins' case as Aventis though given immunity was 'subsequently sued.with its fellow conspirators in national courts.' Thus, undertakings must consider this fact before taking advantage of the notice. This may undermine the effectiveness of the notice; because it 'may serve in time as a disincentive to undertakings to take advantage of the leniency programme' which in turn restricts the operation of the notice and its successes. However, it has been stated, though, in the US context, that the 'risk of civil consequences has not prevented the leniency programme from being a success' and that there is a 'lower risk of civil actions in Europe.' Further, the commission imposes very high fines for cartel activity and immunity from these fines may well compensate for the risk of paying fines for third party actions. However, despite this argument this may still be a disincentive for a prospective applicant.

(also known as the Dawn raid sufficiency test). Commission notice on immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel dawn raid sufficiency test could be argued to lack predictability as 'there is no defined legal standard for the ordering of a dawn raid investigation.' Therefore, whether evidence submitted is sufficient for a dawn raid is given on a purely discretionary basis. This has a negative effect on the operation of the notice because a would be co-operating entity, would not be able to assess whether the evidence they have submitted is of a sufficient degree to enable a dawn raid and thereby, once further conditions are met gain immunity from fines. Therefore, though the commission has increased the predictability of the notice by giving corporate entities full immunity if it meets the dawn raid sufficiency test '. the Commission seems to take away with one hand what it has given with the other.' Through, the invariably discretionary dawn raid test. Further, it is complicated by the fact that there is at present 'no way to put in a 'marker' holding the company's place as first in line, while it gathers sufficient evidence to 'perfect' the marker' if the undertaking should fail the discretionary dawn raid test on its first approach to the commission. The lack of a marker system creates uncertainty, which in turn reduces the predictability and transparency of the notice, for a would be co-operating entity and creates, a complex situation for the commission. This will be explained further in the following argument. The commission may be placed in an interesting position 'if a second firm comes in hoping for leniency before the dawn raid triggered by the first has been executed.' In the event that this occurs theoretically the commission may have a discretion whom to prosecute (known as Prosecutorial Discretion), which reduces the transparency and predictability of the notice. Or most likely the second firm may gain leniency rather than the first firm whom failed in gaining sufficient evidence. Further, there is an increased risk, for the undertaking 'who cannot be sure whether another company has already won the race under point .' Again the US has dealt with this problem, and created a procedure, which in effect, protects the undertaking from the occurrence above. 'The US process allows companies to inform the 'DOJ of the violation' and confirm 'that it will return at a later date with a full 'proffer' to 'perfect' the marker put down earlier.' This in turn reduces the 'higher burden akin to the EU notice to secure first place in line for immunity. Further, the US notice 'is inherently transparent because they 'have eliminated, to a great extent, the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in its application' because each company knows that if they are the first to submit evidence they will receive immunity, and they can also use the marker process, to their benefit, to ensure that they mark their place in the line. Therefore, the DOJ cannot use their own discretion to state which company should be prosecuted and which should have immunity. This strengthens the transparency of the US notice. In turn, the lack of a marker system in the EC notice may deter prospective applicants and most importantly 'such a barrier to reporting quickly is also counter to the aims of an immunity system that is meant to encourage companies to race to confess once infringements are found.' Therefore, it seems that a similar process as in the US for a marker system may need to be adopted in order to improve and strengthen the certainty, transparency and predictability of the operation of the notice. However, as apart of the notice possible future revision 'a marker-style system for applying for immunity is being seriously considered' by the commission. The dawn raid test may also need to be explicitly defined; this would in turn reduce the discretionary nature of the term and may improve the predictability of the notice for a prospective undertaking.

Unfortunately, the limitations discussed above, falls into these three prerequisites which may explain, why the notice may not be as effective as the US notice at present. S.D. Hammond, Cornerstones of an Effective Leniency Program, paper presented at the ICN Workshop on Leniency Programs (Sydney, November 004), accessible at < URL ibid Successes of the NoticeHowever, despite the limitations discussed it cannot be denied that the notice, so far has been successful in detecting and prohibiting cartel activity. Therefore, the operation of the notice should not only be discussed in light of its limitations. One should also note that, the US notice has not always been so successful. It has had its time to develop and improve upon its limitations and the EC notice will do the same and reach more successes in time. However, it is clearly evident that the new notice has and will continue to produce better results than the 996 notice. Nonetheless, the '996 notice was very successful' in detecting cartels and 001 was a remarkable year for the detection of cartels where fines reached a total of 'EUR.36 billion.between 996 and 002.' Specifically 'Out of a total of 4 decisions imposing fines. firms cooperated with the Commission under the scheme in 7 cases.' The notice was used in a variety of industries such as chemicals, banks, airlines, beer and paper. The year 002 was also another successful year for the commission as five out of nine cartels, used the notice and gained immunity. This included the case of 'Sotheby's/Christy's' Sothebys were fined EUR 0. million while Christy's gained immunity, 'Electrical and mechanical carbon and graphite products' Morgan Crucible received full immunity and because the second undertaking Carbon Lorraine provided substantial information they received 0% reductions in their fine. Therefore, this reflects that the notice is to a great extent destabilizing cartels and corporations do see the advantages of the notice and have taken it seriously. Therefore, in practice and despite its limitations the notice has indeed 'proved a formidable tool for encouraging firms to cooperate with the commission.'

This is reflected through the 'Draft Commission Notice on Immunity from fines and reduction of fines' in cartel cases which if implemented in the future will take away the discretionary nature of the dawn raid test and will introduce a discretionary marker system, as well as other proposed amendments. Therefore, the commission should be commended for their work. Available at URL ConclusionThe notice is effective as it addresses the difficulty of detecting and proving the existence of a cartel and also the retributive concerns surrounding leniency for cartel offenders. It has been successful since its introduction in 996 as it has resulted in a number of cartels being detected. The limitations of the notice such as the lack of criminal sanctions, amnesty plus, a marker system and the fact that a cartel member may be liable to civil and criminal proceedings in member states and the continuous lack of transparency and certainty may reduce the effectiveness of the operation of the notice within the EU. Moreover these limitations fall into the three prerequisites needed to create a successful leniency notice, namely severe sanctions, heightened fear of detection, and transparency. Thus, it is likely that the EC notice may not as yet emulate the successes of the US notice until certain improvements have been made. The improvements consists of the introduction of criminal sanctions for cartel behaviour, the addition of amnesty plus and a marker system, the issues of confidentiality and the vagueness of the meaning of the dawn raid test are addressed and lastly if the member states are willing to align their laws with the ECN Model Leniency programme. However, it must be noted that the notice is a recent reform which needs time to develop as the US notice has had time to develop. In time the notice will create success stories like that of the US as long as it continues to improve on its limitations. The commission is no doubt working to achieve this objective, and this is reflected through the 'draft Commission Notice on Immunity from fines' and the introduction of the ECN model Law.""","""EC Leniency Notice and Cartels.""","2895","""EC Leniency Notice and Cartels  Cartels are the antithesis of fair competition in the business world. These secret agreements among companies to fix prices, limit production, or share markets are illegal and harm consumers by driving up prices and reducing choices. In the European Union, the European Commission is tasked with enforcing antitrust laws to prevent cartels and other anti-competitive practices. One of the tools the Commission uses to uncover and dismantle cartels is the EC Leniency Notice.  The EC Leniency Notice is a crucial mechanism for detecting and prosecuting cartels in the EU. This system provides incentives for cartel members to come forward and provide evidence of collusion in exchange for reduced or waived fines. By encouraging companies to blow the whistle on cartel activities in which they have been involved, the EC Leniency Notice plays a pivotal role in breaking up illegal agreements, deterring future cartels, and ultimately protecting consumers and promoting fair competition in the EU market.  Cartels operate in secrecy, making them challenging for competition authorities to detect and prove. The EC Leniency Notice offers cartel members a way out by allowing them to self-report their participation in cartel activities. This voluntary disclosure of information enables the European Commission to gather evidence and build cases against cartels, leading to successful prosecutions and sanctions against the companies involved. The leniency program has proven to be an effective tool in the fight against collusion, as it offers companies the opportunity to mitigate their penalties by cooperating with antitrust authorities.  Under the leniency program, the first company to come forward with information about a cartel may be granted full immunity from fines. This means that the whistleblower will not face any financial penalties for their involvement in the cartel, provided they meet the conditions set out in the leniency notice. Subsequent companies that provide valuable evidence or cooperation may also benefit from reduced fines, making it a race for leniency among cartel members. This aspect of the leniency program creates a strong incentive for companies to break ranks and expose illegal agreements.  The leniency process is designed to be confidential to protect the identity of the whistleblowers and the information they provide. This confidentiality is crucial in encouraging companies to come forward without fear of retaliation from other cartel members or damage to their reputation. By ensuring the protection of leniency applicants, the European Commission can gather vital insider information to uncover and dismantle cartels effectively.  Once a leniency application is submitted, the European Commission conducts an investigation to verify the accuracy and usefulness of the information provided. If the evidence proves to be substantial and leads to the successful prosecution of the cartel, the leniency applicant can benefit from reduced fines or immunity. This process requires cooperation from the whistleblower, including providing relevant documents, testimony, and other evidence to support the Commission's case against the cartel.  The leniency program is not without its challenges and limitations. Cartel members may hesitate to come forward due to the risks involved, such as potential damage to their reputation or exposure to civil lawsuits. Additionally, the timing of leniency applications plays a significant role in determining the level of immunity or reduction in fines granted. Companies that wait too long to apply for leniency may receive lesser benefits or be excluded from the program altogether.  Moreover, leniency is not a one-size-fits-all solution for combating cartels. While the program has been successful in uncovering numerous illegal agreements and imposing sanctions on cartel members, some cartels may operate without detection or choose not to participate in leniency due to the risks involved. Antitrust authorities must rely on a combination of leniency applications, investigations, and intelligence gathering to effectively combat collusion in the marketplace.  In conclusion, the EC Leniency Notice is a vital tool in the European Commission's arsenal against cartels. By incentivizing companies to come forward and expose illegal agreements, the leniency program helps uncover collusion, protect consumers, and maintain fair competition in the EU market. While challenges exist in implementing the leniency system, its role in dismantling cartels and deterring anti-competitive behavior cannot be understated. As long as cartels continue to undermine fair competition, the EC Leniency Notice will remain a crucial instrument in the fight against collusion.""","855"
"272","""The decline in voting in Britain, at all levels of government, has given the impression of a decline in popular participation, and seems to suggest an apathetic electorate who do not care about becoming engaged in politics or democracy. However, to infer this simply from studying electoral turnout ignores the multiple 'entrance points' into modern politics, which allow for people to become engaged in democratic participation in non-traditional ways. Although there is a decline in voting, interest groups especially single issue groups, are flourishing. There is also an increasing trend of participating on an individual level; activities such as boycotting certain products, or buying fair trade goods. This reflects the changing nature of democracy, not just in Britain, but in the world as a whole. With increasing consensus in 'Westminster' politics, and Britain as a whole, on traditional economic and welfare issues, there has been a shift towards participation on behalf of 'post-materialist' issues, which has shaped this change in the way we participate, and the focus of participation. Democratic participation is no longer being exclusively exercised at the polls to influence Westminster; people are using their wallets and social conscience to lobby for change at a local, national and global level. These changes in democratic participation have many possible explanations. The historic low turnouts of 001 and 005/8, at 9.% and 1.% respectively seem to indicate that 0% of people simply do not care enough about politics or democracy to participate. This seems to be supported by another traditional indicator of participation, party membership. In the 95/80s, in 0 people were members of a political party; that has now dropped to in 0. However, this trend does not necessarily indicate a decline in participation, merely a change in the methods used. A Citizens Audit in 000-001, indicated that, in the past 2 months, 5/8% of those interviewed had engaged in at least one activity intending to influence decision making. The majority of these activities were undertaken at an individual level, such as donating money, or signing petitions. This change is indicative of a wider change in lifestyle, and what Robert Putnam would describe as 'social capital'. The behavioural changes brought about by the rise of television, internet, e-mail and online shopping have permeated political participation too. It is no longer necessary to join a political party to support them; you can now pay a donation by direct debit over the internet, or sign an internet petition to show your support for a particular issue. This has been expanded in recent years, particularly through the internet, with 'weblogs' and political websites gaining increasing prominence in election campaigns as a way of participating. The decline in voting and party membership has shown a fall in traditional participation, but this is equal to a rise in new, individual forms of participation arguably brought about by a changing, more inter-connected and globalised world. Electoral Commission Report, 'Election 005/8: Turnout', 9th October 005/8. Available from URL Accessed th February 006 Whitely, P. 'Civic Renewal and Participation in Britain' Available from URL p.5/8/6 Whitely, P. 'Civic Renewal and Participation in Britain' Available from URL p. Putnam, Robert, 'Bowling Alone: the collapse and revival of American community' New York: Touchstone Globalisation in its more radical sense may also explain the changing nature and focus of democratic participation in Britain. The creation of a neo-liberal, market orientated world has taken a great deal of decision making power away from national government, as has further integration into the E.U. To add to this, there is no longer any great debate in mainstream society in ideological terms, with the rise of New Labour, particularly the rewording of Clause IV, being the symbolic evidence of this. Therefore, the way people participate has had to change. The 'Make Poverty History' campaign in July 005/8 was intended to target the G8 meeting; however, African poverty was not even an issue just two months earlier in the General election. This is because of a belief that Britain as a nation state cannot single-handedly affect this issue. It takes the co-operation of the G8, World Bank, IMF and U.N to effectively deal with global poverty, and in these bodies, the general public have no democratic vote, and are certainly not invited to join these organisations. Because of an increasingly globalised world, the forms of participation must change, from parties to pressure groups, and from voting to 'consumer power', such as buying Fair Trade products, for in the modern world, it is not only our own nation states that have power, but also supranational bodies, TNCs, and other foreign governments. Changes in participation do not indicate a crisis for democracy, simply a change in its form and focus, to adjust to a more sophisticated and complex political reality. However, globalisation alone does not explain why people seem to care less about the issues that were at the heart of political debate twenty years ago. For instance, it does not explain why debates over the poll tax been replaced by those about climate change. Increasingly, Britain is becoming a nation of post-materialists, a fact hat David Davis recognised when he coined the term, 'The Wristband Generation'. Research carried out by De Graaf and Evans suggests the emergence of a new generation concerned with post-materialist issues not connected to the accumulation of wealth, but connected to lifestyle, the environment and social justice. Crucially, they also claim that the most likely to be post-materialists are the higher educated and more affluent, the group who traditionally are highly politically engaged. In the economic turmoil of 945/8-0s, politics was dominated by protests from trade unions, such as the miner's strike of 984, and economics dominated the political scene. Debates focussed around the welfare state, taxation, employment and inflation. In contrast, the 990s and 1 st century, where Britain has been relatively untouched by economic strife, has seen a rise in new issues. Recent political issues which have resulted in large scale participation are anti-war marches, anti-poverty movements, and fox hunting demonstrations. None of these issues are related to economics, and could all be said to be 'post-materialist'. Post materialist issues, as well as often being determined at a supra-national or non-governmental level, are also highly salient. As such, they rarely feature in election campaigns, and political parties barely differ in their stances on them. The increasing post-materialism of the British, especially those who are traditionally politically active, has led to a move away from traditional participation and towards the creation of New Social Movements, to fight for the issues that the modern electorate truly care about. Davis, David, Conservative MP, th November 005/8. Found at URL Accessed th February 006 De Graaf, N. & Evans G. 'Why are the Young More Postmaterialist? A Cross-National Analysis of Individual and Contextual Influences on Postmaterialist Values', Comparative Political Studies Vol. 8 No. p.08 A further change in the role of government helps us explain why the participation habits of a large proportion of Britain have changed. The 'hollow' or, 'watchdog state' thesis demonstrates the shift in responsibilities for many services away from government and into the private sector. Central government has devolved or delegated responsibility for a lot of public services, with the independence of the Bank of England, the privatisation of coal, steel, telecommunications and rail services just a few examples of this trend over the last twenty years. As such, there has been a perception that changes in these areas cannot be made by central government. This trend is set to continue further, with the creation of 'trust hospitals' in 004, and current education proposals which set to further delegate responsibility for key services away from Westminster, to quasi-autonomous bodies. This key change in the role of the state may help to explain why people no longer actively participate in traditional ways such as joining political parties or voting in elections, as these methods can no longer affect a great deal of provisions. This is supported by 'Citizens Audit' data that suggests that in the previous 2 months, 5/8% of parents had tried to change the way education was provided, and 0% of people had tried to improve working conditions. However, this was not attempted by group activities designed to lobby government. Instead, people went directly to headmasters, or LEAs, or their employers in a more individualist manner, to bring about change. Again, this behaviour does not indicate a decline in participation, as is often suggested; rather, a change in the methods used, and who they are targeted at. Whitely, P 'Civic Renewal and Participation in Britain' Available from URL p.6 In Britain, there has been a noticeable decline in interest and participation of traditional politics. Trust in MPs is at an all time low, and cynicism dominates attitudes to central, as well as local and European organs of government. However, 'politics' is not a synonym for government; political decisions are made in a variety of ways, by a variety of people, all over the world, whether it is a change in refuse collection or international sanctions on Iran. It is a mistake to suggest that a decline in traditional participation indicates a decline in all democratic participation. A change in the nature of government, the power of government to affect change, and the issues which people are interested in has led to a change in the political behaviour of many people. The growth in Fair Trade products in particular has shown that, whilst people may not lobby their MP for trade justice, they have made a conscious political decision nevertheless to try and bring about change. It also demonstrates that economic well being is not what many people now care about, but instead hold post-materialist values. A growth of individualist participation mirrors a wider social change that puts emphasis on individualism, but this does not mean that people are not participating. The nature and focus of 'democracy' in Britain is indeed changing, away from influencing central government through voting. However, this does not necessarily mean that political participation is in decline in modern Britain. MORI statistics indicate 5/8% of people responded 'some/never' to 'How much do you trust national government to put the needs of the general public before the needs of themselves or their political party?'

From traditional forms of engagement like voting and attending rallies to newer modes such as online activism and social media campaigns, the ways in which people participate in politics have diversified and expanded. This shift has not only democratized political involvement but has also presented both opportunities and challenges for individuals, communities, and societies at large.  Historically, political participation was largely synonymous with voting in elections or engaging in physical activism, such as protests and marches. While these methods remain vital components of democracy, the landscape of political participation has broadened considerably. Today, individuals can contribute to the political process through various channels, including social media platforms, online petitions, crowdfunding for political causes, and grassroots movements that harness digital connectivity to mobilize supporters and amplify voices.  One of the most transformative changes in political participation has been the advent of social media. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have revolutionized the way people engage with politics by providing a space for dialogue, information sharing, and activism. Social media enables individuals to express their opinions, connect with like-minded individuals, and raise awareness about social and political issues with unprecedented reach and speed. Politicians and political parties have also leveraged social media to communicate directly with constituents, bypassing traditional media channels and engaging in real-time conversations with voters.  The rise of online activism has further blurred the lines between traditional and contemporary forms of political participation. Online petitions, digital advocacy campaigns, and crowdfunding platforms have empowered individuals to initiate change, mobilize support, and hold governments and corporations accountable. Platforms like Change.org and Avaaz have enabled millions of people worldwide to add their voices to causes ranging from environmental conservation to human rights, demonstrating the power of collective action in the digital age.  In addition to social media and online platforms, new forms of political participation have emerged, such as hacktivism, data activism, and digital dissent. Hacktivist groups like Anonymous use digital tools to promote political agendas, expose government or corporate misconduct, and protect online freedom of speech. Data activists work to make government data more accessible and transparent, enabling citizens to better understand and engage with public policy and decision-making processes. Digital dissent, exemplified by movements like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street, has shown how social media can be a catalyst for mass mobilization and political change.  The changing nature of political participation extends beyond digital realms to encompass shifts in demographics, values, and modes of civic engagement. Younger generations, in particular, are reshaping traditional notions of political participation by advocating for issues like climate change, racial justice, and LGBTQ rights through innovative means. Youth-led movements like Fridays for Future and March for Our Lives have demonstrated the power of grassroots activism and collective action in driving social and political change.  Moreover, the growing emphasis on intersectionality and inclusivity has expanded the scope of political participation to encompass a broader range of voices and experiences. Movements like Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, and Indigenous rights movements have highlighted the importance of centering marginalized communities in political discourse and decision-making processes. By amplifying voices that have historically been excluded or silenced, these movements have brought attention to systemic injustices and advocated for more equitable and inclusive forms of political participation.  While the evolving nature of political participation offers new possibilities for engagement and advocacy, it also poses challenges and dilemmas for individuals and societies. The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation on social media has undermined trust in political institutions and distorted public discourse, making it difficult for citizens to make informed decisions and engage meaningfully in the political process. The echo chambers created by algorithmic filtering and polarization online have also exacerbated divisions within societies, hindering constructive dialogue and collaboration across ideological lines.  Furthermore, concerns about data privacy, online surveillance, and digital manipulation have raised questions about the integrity of online political participation and the extent to which individuals' rights and freedoms are protected in the digital realm. Issues of accessibility and digital divide also pose barriers to full participation, as not all individuals have equal access to technology or the skills needed to navigate online spaces effectively. Additionally, the commercialization of social media and online platforms has raised ethical concerns about the influence of money and corporate interests on political participation and decision-making processes.  In navigating these complexities, individuals and societies must strive to cultivate digital literacy, critical thinking skills, and ethical awareness to engage responsibly in the changing landscape of political participation. By being vigilant about the sources of information, verifying facts before sharing or endorsing content, and actively seeking out diverse perspectives and voices, individuals can contribute to a more informed and inclusive public discourse. Moreover, efforts to bridge digital divides, promote media literacy, and regulate online platforms for transparency and accountability can help safeguard the integrity of political participation in the digital age.  Ultimately, the changing nature of political participation reflects the evolving dynamics of democracy, citizenship, and civic engagement in an increasingly interconnected and digitized world. By embracing new forms of participation while upholding core democratic values of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity, individuals can harness the power of technology and social mobilization to advance positive change, foster social justice, and build more resilient and responsive political systems. In doing so, we can collectively shape a future where diverse voices are heard, marginalized communities are empowered, and political participation is truly reflective of the rich tapestry of human experiences and aspirations.""","1076"

Drug A after Drug B: Less spread and median slightly lower One slightly apart form rest of group meaning other factors may affect blood pressure Insufficient data to say whether order B after Drug A: Average less Spread similar Negative value meaning it has made the patients condition worse then no drug Suggests that the order of the drug has effect and drug B after drug A has a negative effect. How large and diverse is the population, 2 is a small sample and a larger sample would give more data on which to evaluate the drugs and the importance of the order given. Initial blood pressure needed to see if drop is proportional to blood pressure and if how much of a hytensive someone is, is a factor Age and other biological data are necessary to see if drugs effectiveness varies with these. What is mm Hg, and how much does it vary may be other factors involved in blood pressure of patients, like stress, diet illness. How was test carried out, under controlled conditions? Was the test carried out by drug company or independently as this may have a effect on the data. Were the people selected at random from the population, or was it people who applied or from doctors list; as such it may be that if all from area then it may not be representative of the population Q2.Average ration of Men to tonnage in a steam ship is crew per 5/8 tonnages. Average ration of Men to tonnage in a sail ship is crew per 7 tonnages. Steam ships have a much larger ratio of tonnage per crew then sail ships; they are also much larger carrying more tonnage and crew. From graph fig. equation of best fit line is.062tonnage.8 = crew size Using tonnage=000 in this equation gives 0 crew needed. I would expect Ships,,,7 and 8 all to be sail ships because they have a small tonnage and low ration of crew per tonnage, which from the data is normally from sail ships. Need information on ship technology of the time, are there dual power ships powered by other means, which could be the power of those not given. Details about where the ships are headed would be useful as a ship to Australia may need more crew then a ship to France and seas the ships are crossing may change crew per tonnage ratio. How was the sample collect, is it random, or just taken for all ships in dock in which case not likely to representative of population as sail and steam ships may be kept in different docks. Not many sail ships given more needed to form a opinion about them; 5/8 ships is not a very big proportion of all the British merchant ships in 907. Would the Registrar of General Shipping have complete crew list or just senior positions? Q3.The majority of cities rainfall is between - inches and sunshine between -0 hours. There are outliers, due to excessive rainfall and due to sunshine. Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Miami all experience excessive rainfall; this may be due to their geographical positions meaning that September is monsoon or hurricane season causing the extra rainfall. Mallorca has lots more sunshine hours then elsewhere may due to its position meaning it gets few clouds in September. Need geographical position of all cities along with their regional climates how this effects them.

The interaction between drugs and the environment can have profound impacts on a person's physical and mental health, as well as their overall well-being. Understanding how these factors influence each other is crucial in addressing substance abuse and addiction issues that affect millions of people worldwide.  One of the key aspects of drug effects is how different substances interact with the body's chemistry. Drugs can alter neurotransmitter levels in the brain, affecting mood, perception, and behavior. For example, stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines increase dopamine levels, leading to heightened alertness and euphoria. On the other hand, depressants such as alcohol and opioids slow down brain activity, causing relaxation and sedation. These changes in brain chemistry are what produce the desired effects or """"high"""" that users seek.  Environmental factors play a crucial role in influencing drug use and its effects on individuals. Factors such as family dynamics, peer pressure, socioeconomic status, and cultural influences can shape a person's attitudes towards drug use and their likelihood of using substances. For instance, growing up in an environment where drug use is normalized or even encouraged can increase the risk of developing substance abuse issues later in life.  Furthermore, the availability of drugs in a person's environment can also impact their substance use patterns. Easy access to drugs increases the likelihood of experimentation and regular use. This is particularly relevant in neighborhoods where illicit substances are prevalent and easily obtainable. The normalization of drug use in such environments can desensitize individuals to the risks associated with substance abuse.  Moreover, environmental stressors such as poverty, trauma, discrimination, and lack of social support can contribute to the development of substance abuse problems. Individuals experiencing high levels of stress or facing adverse life events may turn to drugs as a coping mechanism. The cycle of stress and substance abuse can further exacerbate mental health issues and create a vicious cycle of dependence.  In addition to socio-economic factors, physical surroundings can also influence drug effects. Environmental factors like access to healthcare, community resources, and treatment services can impact an individual's ability to seek help for substance abuse. Limited access to addiction treatment facilities or mental health services can hinder recovery efforts and perpetuate the cycle of addiction.  Environmental interventions play a crucial role in addressing substance abuse issues. Creating supportive and drug-free environments through community programs, education, and outreach efforts can help prevent drug use initiation and support individuals in recovery. By promoting positive social norms and providing resources for those struggling with addiction, communities can mitigate the impact of environmental factors on drug use.  In conclusion, the interaction between drug effects and environmental factors is complex and multifaceted. Understanding how these factors influence each other is essential in addressing substance abuse and addiction. By considering the interconnected nature of drug use and the environment, we can develop comprehensive strategies to prevent substance abuse, support recovery, and promote overall well-being for individuals and communities alike.""","585"
"6055","""Linguistics, the scientific study of language, is essential in the field of speech and language pathology. It provides the foundation in understanding the nature and causes of communication disorders. In carrying out clinical work, linguistic knowledge is applied in identifying and assessing speech and language disorders in children and adults, as well as in planning and performing appropriate therapeutic interventions. Linguistic theories provided a distinction between speech and language. Saussure, the founder of modern linguistics, contributed the basis of explaining spoken communication. Speech is a physiological act made by an individual, which results in the production of physical sound waves that is considered of having concrete existence. Language is a psychological abstract that does not have substance but exist as a 'form' in the shared knowledge of a linguistic community. Within language, it can be divided into two aspects, language language - The study of sound system of a language; includes the inventory of the rules for their combination and pronunciationMorphology - The study of structure of words; includes the rules of word formationSyntax - The study of rules of sentence formation; it represents speaker's knowledge of the structure of phrases and sentencesSemantics - The study of linguistic meaning of morphemes, words, phrases and sentencesPragmatics - The study of how context and situation affects meaning It is important to recognize that although language can be separated into multiple levels, each linguistic level interacts and has influence on one another. A breakdown in any of the linguistic levels will result atypical communication condition. I would further discuss the links between linguistics with speech and language pathology, including its role in assessment and management, with reference to two communication disorders: speech disorder developed in children with cleft disorder acquired by adults with aphasia Cleft palate is a congenital malformation that involves the hard or soft palate or both, unilaterally or bilaterally. There is sub-mucous cleft where the surface of the palate appears intact in contrast with overt cleft. It is a type of articulatory disorder, which may be accompanied with or without phonological consequences. Knowledge in phonetics, especially articulatory phonetics in this case, is crucial in understanding the pathology of cleft palate. Majority of English consonants are oral sounds produced with a velic closure, where a sufficient air pressure is achieved in the mouth; except for the nasal consonants, and, which is produced by lowering the velum to allow air flow through the nose. Problem in the velopharyngeal mechanism in children with cleft palate causes hypernasality. Hypernasality can also be influenced by degree of mouth opening, tongue position and relationship of maxilla and that there is also a tendency for contacts to the back of the mouth. Backing, is a deviation from normal speech development, for example in for 'daddy', which is different from the stopping of fricatives in for 'sue' and cluster reduction in for 'spoon' that are observed as part of the normal development process in children. Dental abnormalities and malocclusion between the upper and lower jaw may be present in children with cleft palate and interfere in speech production of fricatives / s /, / z /, / /, / /, / f / and / v / and alveolar plosives / t / and / d /. A compensatory substitution for labiodental and with bilabial and may be conduction that there is breakdown in preparation of representation for articulation and programming of the articulators.Phonemic paraphasiaProduction of fluent speech with phonemic errors of omissions, additions, displacement and substitution that comply with phonotactic rules, for example 'squottle' for 'bottle'. that the word meaning is accessed but its phonological form is impaired.Neologism, the production of bizarre meaningless word, may result from severe phonemic paraphasia where a random selection of phonemes is made.SyntaxAgrammatismDescribed as a non-fluent output, appearing as telegraphic speech, where content words especially nouns are used in greater extend than grammatical words, for example 'Boy home' for 'The boy went home'. Grammatical morphemes such as affixes are often spite of negative feedback from conversational partner. Comprehension in word level is affected when there is a failure to activate the phonological structure responsible in spoken word recognition, or when there is a problem in evoking appropriate sense relation, may it be reference, hyponymy, antonomy, or synonomy. In sentence level, a comprehension breakdown may be caused by phonological, syntactic, semantic or pragmatic deficit, or attention, memory or other cognitive be carried out to help to expand the complexity and range of syntactic structures in agrammatic patients with syntactic deficit. Semantic therapy involving word-picture-matching task that requires appropriate selection of an item from a spoken name, and written label, as well as categorizing tasks are directed to remediate semantic deficit of word retrieval error (Mackenzie, 991, cited in Ross, 995/8). Residual function should be utilized besides focusing on correcting language impairment present. It is also important to target items with high degree of relevance to the individual and in everyday context of communication. Strategies such as emphasizing key words at the end of sentence, giving time to respond, repetition to clarify and providing cues to help linguistic access can support better outcome in communication. In conclusion, the study of linguistics provides a vital framework for assessment and treatment for speech and language disorders. Application of linguistic principles, combined with the knowledge of psycholinguistics and anatomy, enables a holistic approach towards communication disorders.""","""Linguistics and speech-language pathology""","1137","""Linguistics and speech-language pathology are two interconnected fields that play vital roles in understanding and addressing human communication and its disorders. Linguistics, the scientific study of language, explores how languages are structured, used, and acquired. On the other hand, speech-language pathology focuses on the prevention, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of communication and swallowing disorders.  In linguistics, researchers delve into the intricacies of language, encompassing phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Phonetics examines the physical properties of speech sounds, while phonology investigates how sounds are organized in languages. Morphology studies the structure of words, syntax deals with sentence structures, and semantics explores the meanings of words and sentences. Pragmatics, on the other hand, investigates how context influences language use.  Understanding linguistics is crucial in speech-language pathology as it provides a solid foundation for comprehending language development and disorders. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) apply linguistic principles to assess and treat a wide range of communication difficulties, including speech sound disorders, language disorders, fluency disorders, and voice disorders. By analyzing language at various levels, SLPs can tailor interventions to suit individual needs effectively.  Speech-language pathologists work across diverse settings, including schools, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and private practices. They collaborate with individuals across the lifespan, from infants with feeding difficulties to older adults facing swallowing problems. Their goal is to enhance communication skills, support literacy development, and improve overall quality of life for individuals with communication challenges.  One common area where linguistics and speech-language pathology intersect is in the assessment and treatment of children with language disorders. Language disorders can manifest in difficulties with vocabulary development, sentence structure, storytelling, and social communication. By drawing on linguistic theories and methods, SLPs can assess a child's language skills comprehensively and develop targeted interventions to support their linguistic growth.  For instance, a child with a language disorder may benefit from intervention strategies that focus on expanding their vocabulary, improving their sentence structure, and enhancing their ability to use language in social contexts. By integrating linguistic principles into therapy sessions, SLPs can help children make meaningful progress in their communication skills and achieve communication milestones.  Additionally, linguistics plays a crucial role in accent modification therapy, a specialized area within speech-language pathology. Individuals seeking to modify their accents for personal, professional, or social reasons can benefit from accent modification therapy, where linguistic analysis is used to identify specific pronunciation patterns that contribute to accented speech. By applying linguistic techniques and strategies, SLPs can help individuals modify their accents and achieve their communication goals.  In conclusion, the intersection of linguistics and speech-language pathology highlights the importance of language in human communication and its disorders. Linguistics provides a theoretical framework for understanding the structure and functions of language, while speech-language pathology translates this knowledge into practical interventions for individuals with communication difficulties. By combining linguistic insights with clinical expertise, SLPs can make a significant impact in helping individuals enhance their communication skills, overcome communication challenges, and thrive in their personal and professional lives.""","617"
"299","""Economic growth is defined as an increase in the value of goods and services produced by an economy. It is measured in the percent rate of real GDP and is considered to be an increase in the income of a nation. The existence of massive difference in the standard of living all over the world made economists to find the causation of lower living standard in poor countries and the possible ways of helping them to grow faster and catch up with rich ones. The neoclassical theory of economic growth was developed in 95/86 by Robert M. Solow, hence, also known as the Solow growth model. It presents the Harrod-Domar model, but adding labour as a factor of production. Solow argued that a key determinant of people's standard of living is how much a nation saves and invests. However, capital accumulation alone cannot explain the persistent growth in living standards. The model assigns continues long-run growth to technological progress, but leaves unexplained the economic determinant of that technological progress. It is simply assumed. Saving, technological progress and growth of population affect the level of output and growth of an economy over time. The basic model assumes that there is no technological progress and that the labour force is fixed: Y = shows how much extra output a worker produces when given an extra unit of capital. Despite of positive correlation, the function still experiences constant returns to scale. Diminishing marginal product explains why the economy does not grow forever, but reaches a long-run level of output and capital called steady-state equilibrium where per capita capital and per capita output will stop growing and remain constant. Consumption and investment are two components of demand for output: y = c i. People tend to save a part of their income s, which is a number between and, and consume. for c into equation y = c i, we get: y = (-s) y i. After simplifying, the equation will take the look of i = sy, implying that investment equals, where the savings rate is exactly equal the population growth rate n plus the depreciation rate d. k is the capital widening point because capital is increasing at a rate enough to keep pace with population increase and depreciation. Figure shows effects of a movement in the saving rate from s to s1. Saving per worker is now greater than population growth plus depreciation, so capital accumulation increases, shifting the steady state from point A to B. Capital and productivity per worker are now permanently higher, but economic growth is the same. 'The extra savings are taken by the extra replacement investment implied by the higher level of capital stock, and the extra net investment required to equip each worker with the higher level of capital stock per person' stated Gartner. When the saving rate rises in this model, consumption and the price level both decline. The interest rate has to fall to stimulate sufficient investment to guarantee that saving and investment will remain in balance. An increase in population leads only to a higher steady-state of total output growth, but the steady-state level of per capita output and capital per head would actually be population growth rises. At a point where the income becomes high enough, birth rates will start to fall. In many highly developed countries the population growth almost equals zero. It is extremely difficult to reduce the rate of population growth in poor countries, where the next generation is seen as social security, since having children ensures that the parents are taken care of in their old age. According to Solow growth theory, rich countries should be at a higher point on the production function than poor countries, which implies that the slope, marginal product of ), where u is the labour force in universities. The efficiency of labour is meant to reflect society's knowledge about production methods. Instead of counting the number of physical bodies, we count effective labour input taking function relating per person output to per person capital into account improved education and technology. EL stands for the number of workers L and efficiency of each worker. If we increase K and E by some multiple, the output of both sectors in the economy would be increased by the same rate. The growth continues endogenously because the creation of knowledge would never stop. While saving determines the steady-state stock of physical capital, the labour force in the growth of knowledge. Both of them affect the level of income, but only u affects the steady-state growth rate of income. Human capital is the value of the extra earnings made possible by education. Educated people can produce more output and a higher standard of living. In contrast to the neoclassical growth theory of unexplained exogenous technological change with no potential for policy effect, endogenous growth theory argues that policy measures can have an impact on the long-run growth rate of an economy, even if they do not change the aggregate savings rate. Romer and Lucas have built a model in which the key to growth is the development of ideas and transferring them to new goods. The incentives to production of ideas rely on monopoly power that is reinforced by patents and copyrights. Efficient international trade makes sure that consumers can enjoy all the benefits of new goods from anywhere in the world. Government policies can positively influence growth rates by taxing consumption subsidizing investment and research, shifting resources from government consumption to government investment. For instance, invest more on infrastructure such as airports, highways, electricity. The legal system must have fair property rights and protect owners from thieves. The tax system must be well-managed. There must be open opportunities for new investors to start a business. Geographical location of countries still causes problems for poor countries to develop. Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University argued that technologies developed in the temperate zones may not be applicable to tropical areas as a result of weather difference and soil structure. Human capital investment in tropical areas is still not enough. This fact pulls down the demand which for high tech products. Alwyn Young carefully studied growth of Asian Tigers and concluded that all four remarkable high growth which is most explained by increased input, not by higher productivity. Since in 960's these countries were quite poor, the labour force was extremely cheap. The number of workers dramatically increased due to women's participation. Large amounts of money were spent on improving the college and university system to improve and thus increase productivity. The education system was reformed at all levels ensuring that all children attended elementary education and compulsory high school education. Domestic consumption was discouraged through government policies such as high tariffs. A high degree of economic freedom, political stability, clear property rights, encouragement of export, high savings rate ensured their rapid transformation from poor countries to highly-industrialized rich nations in thirty years. Economist Joseph Stiglitz commented that in these countries 'the Government created an environment in which markets could thrive'. Because of the focus on export driven growth, Asian Tigers experienced currency devaluation. These economies focus exclusively on export demand and put high tariffs on imports which heavily affect the economic health of their export nations. In addition, these nations have met difficulties after losing their initial competitive advantage, cheap labour. Many economists argue that nowadays, India and China with their fast-growing economies are following the steps of the Tigers. Since gaining independence in 971, health and education levels in Bangladesh have improved remarkably, and poverty has been declining. Yet it remains one of the poorest countries in the world. The income level is very low. Based on Barro and Sala-i-Martin report, for the period from 960 and 985/8 investment in Bangladesh averaged. percent of GDP compare to Japan's 6. percent and USA's 4 percent. The effect of both low saving and high population growth is as theory would predict. Hostile climates for foreign investment, low investment in human capital, unsustainable public sector spending and weak governance are all causes of its extreme situation right now. Since the intervention of non-governmental organisations the improvements are highly significant. Reducing population growth and attaining gender parity in school enrolments rates are notable achievements of recent years. In the past decade, infant mortality has been reduced by half. Adult literacy rates have been increased on average by seven per cent. On the other hand, inefficient state-owned enterprises, in particular those providing utilities and infrastructure, have resulted to significant loses by not meeting national demand. Poor governance and pervasive institutional weakness still remain biggest problems in Bangladesh. Although Solow's model ignores some important aspects of macroeconomics, such as short-run fluctuations in employment and savings rates, his resulting contains a number of very useful insights about the dynamics of the growth process. The success of some fast-growing nations like the Asian Tigers and the miraculously quick recovery of Japan and Germany after World War Two are 'balanced' with the failure of other poor nations. Thus it is extremely difficult to prove the triumph of any particular economic theory..""","""Economic Growth and Development Theories""","1752","""Economic Growth and Development Theories have long been fundamental to understanding the ways in which societies evolve and prosper. These theories seek to explain the mechanisms through which economies expand, create wealth, and improve people's living standards. Over the years, various economic thinkers have proposed different explanations and models to understand the complexities of economic growth and development. This essay will explore some of the key theories that have shaped our understanding of these concepts, including classical, neoclassical, structuralist, Marxist, and modern growth theories.  Classical economic theory, developed by economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo, emphasized the role of markets, labor, and capital in driving economic growth. The classical view posited that growth was primarily a result of the efficient allocation of resources through market mechanisms. Smith's concept of the invisible hand, which suggests that individuals pursuing self-interest inadvertently promote the collective good, underpins this perspective. Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage further underscored the benefits of specialization and trade in fostering economic growth.  Neoclassical economics, which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, built upon classical theories but introduced new elements such as marginal analysis and utility maximization. Neoclassical economists like Alfred Marshall and Leon Walras focused on factors like technology, innovation, and productivity as drivers of economic growth. Their emphasis on equilibrium, rational decision-making, and market efficiency continues to shape contemporary economic thought.  Structuralist theories, popular in the mid-20th century, challenged the neoclassical view by highlighting the role of structural barriers and market imperfections in hindering development. Economists like Raúl Prebisch and Hans Singer argued that developing countries faced unique challenges such as unequal exchange with developed nations, limited industrialization, and dependence on primary commodity exports. They advocated for policies that could correct these structural imbalances and promote local industrialization and diversification.  Marxist economics, inspired by the works of Karl Marx, offers a critical perspective on economic growth and development. Marxists argue that capitalism inherently leads to exploitation, inequality, and crises that impede sustained growth. They emphasize the role of class struggle, surplus value extraction, and capital accumulation in shaping economic dynamics. Marxist development theorists advocate for socialist transformations to address systemic injustices and inequities inherent in capitalist economies.  Modern growth theories, developed in the latter half of the 20th century, aim to integrate elements from various economic perspectives to provide a more comprehensive understanding of economic development. Endogenous growth theory, pioneered by economists like Paul Romer and Robert Lucas, emphasizes the role of knowledge, innovation, and human capital in driving long-term growth. This theory suggests that investment in education, research, and technology can spur productivity gains and sustainable development.  Other modern approaches like New Institutional Economics and Evolutionary Economics focus on institutions, governance, and evolutionary processes as critical drivers of economic growth. These theories highlight the importance of institutions in shaping incentives, property rights, and market behaviors that influence economic outcomes. They stress the need for effective governance structures, rule of law, and regulatory frameworks to support economic development.  In conclusion, Economic Growth and Development Theories provide valuable insights into the diverse factors that influence economic progress and prosperity. While classical and neoclassical theories underscore the importance of markets, innovation, and efficiency, structuralist and Marxist perspectives draw attention to structural inequalities and systemic barriers to development. Modern growth theories offer nuanced approaches that combine elements from different traditions to offer a more holistic understanding of economic dynamics. By considering and synthesizing insights from these various theories, policymakers and economists can develop more effective strategies to promote sustainable and inclusive growth for societies around the world.""","732"
"117","""The economic history of Britain in the late 8 th and early 9 th centuries certainly displayed symptoms of the beginning of an industrial revolution. This essay shall examine the period between 760 and 830; the 760s seeing the introduction of important inventions, such as Hargreaves' Spinning Jenny, and Watts' steam engine, and the period until 830 being one in which these macroinventions were still being improved to provide greater utility. Crafts, for instance, states that until 830 water power was still often more inexpensive than steam power. A revolution could be thought of as being an almost complete transformation in many aspects of society, with 'industrial' implying an almost complete revolution from an agrarian to an industrialised economy involving factories and mass production. Important changes socially, technologically and economically could therefore be implied by this definition. This essay shall however argue that whilst important technological change did occur, the fact that the full potential impact had yet to occur showed that this period constituted an important prerequisite for what was to follow rather than constituting the revolution in itself. The total factor productivity growth measures of Crafts, cited in Berg and Hudson estimate that TFP growth did not exceed % until post 830. In itself, this illustrates that throughout the period pre 830, macroinventions did not lead to a revolutionary change in the allocation of labour, production methods and finance. In fact, much of the advantage of the technological change had yet to be fully exploited. Berg and Hudson however contest the reliability of Crafts' measure, believing Crafts' samples to be heavily weighted and ignored certain industries. Some of their points, for instance that early steam engines were unreliable and often subject to breakdown however could demonstrate that indeed this measure was subject to an upward trend, which did not reach a peak until successive microinventions had resulted in a reliable and widely useable technology. For instance, a compound engine designed in 803 to drastically save on fuel costs was not given adapted for industry until 845/8. This therefore suggests that this period of slower TFP growth was an important prerequisite for a later acceleration, although by 830 this had not gathered full steam. The period in question therefore can only be described as the beginnings of a revolution and not the revolution in itself. It could however be considered that Mokyr's distinction between the traditional economy, which included agriculture and traditional trades, such as blacksmiths, from the modern economy consisting of new industrialised industries illustrates that in fact aggregate productivity growth was weighted down by a large traditional sector. Mokyr cit McCloskey estimates that between 780 and 860, labour productivity growth in the traditional sector was.% per annum, compared with.% in the modern sector. Although firstly these estimates are not directly comparable with those of Crafts due to differences in the productivity used, they illustrate the impact that the traditional economy had on the picture of the aggregate economy. This therefore suggests that by comparison a revolution was occurring in this modern sector, labour productivity growth being triple that of the Mokyr's traditional economy. As it is possible to consider that a revolution must have a starting point from which it must spread this again helps to illustrate that the period 760 until 830 as an important prerequisite for an Industrial Revolution, i.e. a revolution here could be seen as beginning within a small proportion of the economy. Crafts further illustrates the above argument by stating that sixty percent of industrial employment in the first half of the nineteenth century occurred in the 'traditional and small-scale' industry. This again helps to illustrate that there hadn't been a complete revolution, with much labour still allocated to traditional occupations. Berg and Hudson's argument that pre 830 worker's living standards had suffered little impact from the changes reinforces Craft's previous point; using the idea that a revolution is supposed to bring an all encompassing positive change in society, the fact that personal consumption had been largely unaffected illustrates that socially a revolution had definitely not occurred. However, changes in the allocation of the male labour force between industry and agriculture do illustrate significant change; Crafts estimates that male employment in agriculture fell from 3% to 9% between 760 and 840, whilst male employment in industry rose from 4% to 7% in the same period. The net effect could therefore again be considered as beginnings of a revolution, changes in occupation could be considered to be a major change in society, although this had yet to feed through to worker's standards of living. Technologically speaking, however, it could be considered unfair to say that traditional industry was not affected by the Industrial Revolution. Bekar cit Berg points out that small cottage producers installed new technology and small steam engines. It is therefore perhaps wrong to think of Mokyr's 'traditional' sector as being wholly traditional and stagnant. This therefore illustrates that many businesses sought to try to take advantage of the benefits that technological improvement potentially brought to them, showing that the increase in innovation post 770 brought a change to working practices throughout much of the economy. However, Bekar states that it was not until factories were redesigned specifically to exploit new steam power that the advantages of this General Purpose Technology were able to be widely felt. Bekar cit Mokyr however points out that even as late as the 85/80s, the 'traditional' sector still employed hundreds of thousands of people suggesting that whilst this significant proportion of the population were still employed in workshop based employment there was still a large sector of the economy not designed to gain efficiently from earlier inventions. Consequentially, this demonstrates that whilst dominant small scale industry did not prevent the beginnings of an industrial revolution, the time lags involved in implementing the changes which needed to occur meant that an industrial revolution was not going to occur instantaneously. Berg and Hudson point out the high investment requirements involved with rapid technological development. As new innovation was firstly unreliable and often subject to breakdown, and secondly, became quickly obsolete, high capital investment was constantly needed to upgrade. It therefore seems logical that the ability to accumulate capital is an important consideration for this question of whether this period could be indeed described as an Industrial Revolution, since finance appears such a fundamental necessity. Bekar cit Williamson states that capital accumulation during the period examined was dented because of the borrowing of the British Government to finance war spending, Williamson believing that had the Napoleonic War not occurred, then British GDP could have been.% higher at that time. This suggests that perhaps this period of economic history could not be described as revolutionary because time lags in industrialisation became an opportunity cost of war spending; industrialisation wasn't revolutionary because it hadn't reached its full potential. The fact that there was greater demand for loanable funds created a 'crowding out effect' whereby interest rates rose, making the cost of borrowing more expensive for entrepreneurs and businesses. What was however particularly significant was the Usury Law, which existed until 832. This prevented the interest rate on any borrowing from exceeding %, although this did not apply to Government borrowing. Mathias for instance points out how this dented the construction industry who suffered from higher interest rates; when the market rate of interest exceeded %, the loans were directed towards the Government. Therefore, the fact that the financial market was not allowed to function entirely freely could illustrate that perhaps there were some political constraints that dented the ability for a full revolution to occur. Capital accumulation is evidently an important part of economic growth, and the fact that this was dented by Government policy perhaps suggests that a major stakeholder in the national economy had not responded to aid growth. There had therefore not been a full political revolution in the necessary conditions for industrialisation. To conclude, although the economic history of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries certainly had significance, in itself this period cannot be described as a full industrial revolution. Certainly, the growth of total factor productivity, as shown by Crafts estimates was on the rise, however by 830, there was still much room for improvement. What, more than anything else, makes this only the beginnings of a revolution is the fact that the traditional industries still carried such large weight that in aggregate terms, the economic effects had been far from astounding. Although these traditional industries were far from being completely stagnant, many workshops using small steam engines and Spinning Jennies, what was needed was a more complete transformation that would take full advantage of the efficiencies of the new technologies. Although this could partly be explained by the slowdown in potential capital accumulation during the period of the Napoleonic War, due to higher Government demand for loanable funds, what is certain is that a complete revolution is a process which takes many years to complete, with constant improvement needed to ensure that new inventions fulfil their potential. The analysis in this essay overall therefore concludes that although an Industrial Revolution had started and a lot of the foundation laid, it was by no means complete.""","""Early Industrial Revolution in Britain""","1784","""The Early Industrial Revolution in Britain, spanning from the late 18th to the early 19th centuries, marked a profound shift in the country's economic, social, and technological landscape. This transformative period saw the emergence of factories, mechanized production, and urbanization on an unprecedented scale. The Industrial Revolution was fueled by a combination of factors such as technological innovations, access to raw materials, a growing population, and a stable political environment. These elements converged to create the perfect conditions for Britain to lead the world into a new era of industrialization.  One of the key catalysts for the Industrial Revolution was the invention and widespread adoption of new technologies. Innovations like the spinning jenny, water frame, and steam engine revolutionized industries such as textiles, coal mining, and transportation. These inventions significantly increased productivity, reduced costs, and opened up new markets both domestically and internationally. The mechanization of production processes not only boosted efficiency but also laid the foundation for the modern factory system, where specialized machines and skilled laborers worked together under one roof.  Access to abundant raw materials, particularly coal and iron ore, played a crucial role in driving industrial growth. Coal was used to power steam engines and furnaces, while iron ore was essential for manufacturing machinery, railways, and infrastructure. Britain's extensive network of canals and later railways facilitated the transportation of goods and materials, linking industrial regions and enabling the efficient movement of products across the country. This transportation infrastructure was vital in supporting the expansion of industries and the development of a national market.  The Industrial Revolution also significantly impacted the demographics and social fabric of Britain. As rural populations migrated to urban centers in search of employment, cities like Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds experienced rapid population growth. The concentration of people in industrial hubs led to the emergence of crowded slums, poor living conditions, and social inequalities. Factory workers, including men, women, and children, toiled long hours in harsh conditions for meager wages, sparking debates about labor rights, working conditions, and the role of government in regulating industry.  Despite the economic prosperity brought about by industrialization, the period was not without its challenges. The shift from agrarian to industrial societies led to disruptions in traditional ways of life, as small-scale farmers were displaced by large-scale agricultural operations and cottage industries were replaced by mechanized factories. This transition created social tensions and conflicts as communities grappled with the impact of industrialization on their livelihoods and identities.  In conclusion, the Early Industrial Revolution in Britain was a transformative period that laid the foundation for modern industrialized economies. By harnessing technological innovations, exploiting natural resources, and reshaping social structures, Britain became a global powerhouse driving innovation, trade, and economic growth. While the Industrial Revolution brought about unprecedented prosperity and progress, it also raised important questions about the cost of industrialization on society and the environment. Understanding this pivotal period in history is essential for recognizing the complexities of industrial development and its lasting impacts on the world we live in today.""","601"
"7","""The aim of this experiment was to carry out an enzyme assay to study the effects of pH, temperature and product inhibition on an enzyme and calculate the Michaelis constant and order or reaction. This was carried out by assaying alkaline phosphotase under different conditions measuring the extent of reaction with a spectrophotometer. It was discovered that the optimum pH was. whilst the optimum temperature is 2 oC and activity decreases either side of these optimums due to disruption at the active site or denaturing of the enzyme. Phosphate was found to carry out product inhibition and the reaction was determined as first order. The Michaelis constant was calculated to be.871.Enzymes are biological catalyse most of the chemical reactions taking place in the cell. They carry out this catalysis by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower energy transition state. Enzymes are highly specific binding a specific substrate in the active site. The amount of enzyme activity and elements of the kinetics of an enzyme-catalysed reaction can be measured by measuring the rate of appearance of one of the products of the reaction. The effect of a variety of factors on rate of enzyme activity such as pH, temperature, concentration of substrate and enzyme and presence of inhibitors can also be determined using this method. Inhibition of an enzyme involved in an initial step in a metabolic pathway is often carried out by the end product. This is known as feedback inhibition and is an important regulatory strategy. A similar effect, product inhibition occurs when the product of an enzyme catalysed reaction inhibits the enzyme carrying out that reaction. An enzyme catalysed reaction has a reaction rate order. If the rate of the reaction at any instant is proportional to the concentration of the substrate then this is known as first order kinetics. Enzyme kinetics can also be described using the Michaelis-Menten equation. This involves the use of two parameters to describe the kinetic properties of enzymes - V max, the maximum velocity, and K M, the Michaelis Menten constant. K M is related to the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate and is defined as being the concentration of substrate at which the velocity is at half its maximum value. These are linked in the following equation where V O is the rate of formation of product: Here alkaline phosphotase was used to study principles of enzyme kinetics. Alkaline Phosphotase is a is optically active at alkaline pH. It is an excellent enzyme to use in the determination of enzyme kinetics as it is robust and easily assayed. The synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl a convenient choice of substrate to demonstrate the activity of the enzyme as is it colourless until hydrolysed by the enzyme to the products inorganic phosphate and p- so the hydrolysis of pNPP can be followed using a spectrophotometer if the solution is made more alkaline after completion of, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 00. Please see volumes used in making up the concentrations. Determination of Michaelis-Menten constantThe blank used contained no substrate ie. ml buffer, ml enzyme. The concentrations of.,.5/8,.,.5/8,. of reaction determinationTubes were made up with ml enzyme, ml glycine buffer and ml pNPP and the time course of the reaction determined by stopping the reaction and measuring the absorbance at a different time for each tube. The times at which each tube was stopped are as determine the order of reaction shows a straight line and gives a value of k of. 2 oC. Below this point the activity of the enzyme is gradually increasing and after the optimum the activity of the enzyme drops sharply. The gradual increase before the peak is as a result of the general effect of increasing temperature on the rate of any chemical reaction - more kinetic energy is present so the molecules can move around faster increasing the chance of a favourable collision. The descending portion of the graph is due to a decrease in catalytic ability as the enzyme molecules start to be denatured. The denaturation occurs because of decreased stability in the structure of the enzyme molecule at high temperatures resulting in changes to the shape of the active site reducing its affinity for substrate and thereby its activity. At very high temperatures all the enzyme molecules present will be denatured and no activity will take place. This is shown by the trace absorbance shown by the boiled enzyme. Virtually no activity has taken place. The small amount of absorbance present may be due to tiny amounts of product formed from the uncatalysed reaction or a few enzyme molecules still active or from contamination from another source. To have a high optimum pH an enzyme must therefore have a more stable structure than those functioning at lower temperatures, as it must be able to withstand these higher temperatures without losing stability. Product Inhibition of Enzyme ActionIt is clear from graph above that increasing the concentration of a major decrease in the activity of the enzyme - the presence of phosphate is inhibiting the enzyme. As the rate of the reaction started to drop at 0mM phosphate it is clear that the lowest molarity of phosphate which will inhibit alkaline phosphotase lies somewhere between mM and 0mM. At mM the absorbance is almost the same as the control with no phosphate present and so only a very small amount of inhibition, if any, is occurring. Inhibition of the enzyme by the product of the reaction it catalyses in this way is known as product inhibition and has a regulatory role in many metabolic pathways. As the moles of phosphate being produced in the previous experiments were all a lot smaller than seems that the phosphate released in these experiments would have been to small to have had an inhibitory effect on the enzyme. Determination of Michaelis constantThe figure arrived at for this constant was.871. However a lot of error could have been introduced into the calculation throughout the experiment. Firstly in making up the test solutions at the start imprecision could have introduced errors. Translating the absorbances into concentrations involved the use of a calibration curve which means the concentrations are really estimates and the use of a trend line also introduces new error all of which could have resulted in an inaccurate result. The introduction of these errors could have occurred in any of the experiments carried out here. Order of reactionThe graph clearly shows a straight line indicating a first order reaction whilst the value of k is less than. also indicating a first order reaction. This means that the rate of the reaction at any moment is proportional to the concentration of the substrate. Although there are two reactants in the fact that it is still a first order reaction must be due to the mechanism of the reaction. This may be because water is present in such a large excess as pure water is highly concentrated that it is not having an effect on the rate, that is the rate is still only dependent on one concentration - that of p-nitrophenylphosphate and so still only shows first-order kinetics. ConclusionsIn conclusion therefore it was determined that the optimum pH of alkaline phosphatase is. whilst the optimum temperature is about 2 oC. Activity of the enzyme decreases either side of these optimums. The presence of phosphate, one of the products, inhibits the reaction when in concentration of higher than mM with the inhibition being greater as the concentration of phosphate increases. This is known as product inhibition. The Michaelis constant for this reaction has a value of.871 and the reaction is first order.""","""Enzyme kinetics and inhibition""","1518","""Enzyme kinetics is a branch of biochemistry that focuses on studying the rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Enzymes are biological catalysts that play a crucial role in facilitating biochemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur. Understanding enzyme kinetics is vital for comprehending the mechanisms underlying biological processes and developing therapeutic strategies for various diseases.  Enzyme kinetics involves the study of the rates at which enzymes catalyze reactions and the factors that influence these rates. One of the key parameters in enzyme kinetics is the Michaelis-Menten equation, which describes the relationship between the rate of an enzymatic reaction and the concentration of substrate. The Michaelis-Menten equation is expressed as:  \\[ V = \\dfrac{{V_{max} [S]}}{{K_m + [S]}} \\]  Where: - V is the initial reaction velocity - \\( V_{max} \\) is the maximum reaction velocity - [S] is the substrate concentration - \\( K_m \\) is the Michaelis constant  The Michaelis constant, \\( K_m \\), represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of the maximum velocity (\\( V_{max} \\)). It is a measure of the enzyme's affinity for its substrate. A low \\( K_m \\) value indicates high substrate affinity, while a high \\( K_m \\) value suggests low substrate affinity.  Enzyme kinetics also involves the concept of enzyme inhibition, where the activity of an enzyme is regulated by inhibitors. Inhibitors can be classified into two main types: reversible inhibitors and irreversible inhibitors. Reversible inhibitors can further be categorized into competitive, non-competitive, and uncompetitive inhibitors based on their mechanism of action.  Competitive inhibitors compete with the substrate for binding to the active site of the enzyme. They can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration to outcompete the inhibitor for binding to the enzyme. As a result, competitive inhibitors increase the apparent \\( K_m \\) of the enzyme without affecting the \\( V_{max} \\). Examples of competitive inhibitors include statins, commonly used in cholesterol-lowering medications.  Non-competitive inhibitors, on the other hand, bind to the enzyme at a site other than the active site, causing a conformational change in the enzyme that reduces its catalytic activity. Non-competitive inhibitors do not compete with the substrate for binding and can bind to both the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. Unlike competitive inhibitors, non-competitive inhibitors affect the \\( V_{max} \\) of the enzyme without altering the \\( K_m \\). An example of a non-competitive inhibitor is cyanide, which inhibits cytochrome c oxidase in the electron transport chain.  Uncompetitive inhibitors bind only to the enzyme-substrate complex, forming an enzyme-inhibitor-substrate ternary complex. This type of inhibition results in a decrease in both the \\( V_{max} \\) and the \\( K_m \\) of the enzyme. Uncompetitive inhibitors are less common than competitive and non-competitive inhibitors but play a vital role in regulating enzyme activity in certain metabolic pathways.  In addition to reversible inhibition, irreversible inhibitors permanently inactivate enzymes by forming covalent bonds with amino acid residues at the active site or other critical regions of the enzyme. Irreversible inhibitors are often used as pharmaceutical agents to target specific enzymes involved in diseases such as cancer. For example, aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis.  Understanding enzyme kinetics and inhibition is crucial for various fields, including drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and biotechnology. By studying the kinetics of enzymatic reactions, researchers can optimize reaction conditions, develop more efficient enzymes, and design inhibitors for therapeutic purposes. Enzyme inhibitors are vital tools in pharmacology for targeting specific enzymes involved in disease pathways and represent a cornerstone in drug development.  Enzyme kinetics and inhibition have practical applications in drug design and personalized medicine. By analyzing the kinetics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and understanding the mechanisms of inhibition, researchers can identify new drug targets, design more potent inhibitors, and develop personalized therapies tailored to individual patients based on their enzyme profiles. This precision medicine approach holds great promise for improving treatment outcomes and minimizing side effects in patients with various medical conditions.  Enzyme kinetics and inhibition are also integral to understanding drug interactions and toxicity. Many drugs interact with enzymes in the body, either inhibiting or inducing their activity, which can impact the efficacy and safety of medications. By studying the kinetics of drug metabolism and the effects of enzyme inhibitors or inducers, researchers can predict potential drug interactions and adverse effects, leading to better drug dosing and patient care.  In conclusion, enzyme kinetics and inhibition are fundamental concepts in biochemistry with broad implications for both basic research and applied sciences. By elucidating the mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and the regulation of enzyme activity by inhibitors, scientists can unlock new insights into biological processes, develop novel therapeutics, and advance precision medicine approaches. The study of enzyme kinetics and inhibition continues to drive innovation in fields ranging from pharmaceuticals to biotechnology, offering exciting opportunities for further research and discovery in the future.""","1046"
"3049","""''a e-volving outlookRapidly growing e-commerce, tied with increasingly global Business-to-Consumer interface by way of modern ICTs, continues to attract the interest of firms and services offered by various Principals into optimal travel packages; targeted to meet the needs of the average consumers within specific market trip adds in all specified meals, accommodations, ground transportation, and Diver Insurance; yet excludes all flights, alcoholic drinks, and unspecified meals. The package's booking nature, provides a choice of dates; yet June-November are ideal for shark sightings; so the choice is st - 2 th September. As per the itinerary, the initial days in Cape Town not only include cage-dives, but a dive in Two Oceans Aquarium, and tours of local attractions. Day entails a stopover at a winery, with lunch and wine tasting, before continuing by private bus to Hermanus, hours away. The next days are intensive dives in Shark Alley where ample sharks can be seen. On the afternoon of day, guests are taken to a hotel of their choice in Cape Town; before booking a flight on their own to Krueger National Park; an add-on day trip including accommodations, specified meals, safaris and road transport to and from the airport; without the independent flight back to Cape Town. Website Evaluations: Customer's Perspective The AID-0 ten questions for evaluating a web site, subsequently discussed for selected services related to the above mentioned package. Thus the attempt to maintain similar, if not equal, services across distribution channels is needed. Yet while every attempt was made to maintain this criterion, the niche product, and unavailability of a few services through some channels, required a degree of modification; further discussed later in this assignment. While the following evaluations may hold a level of subjectivity, the attempt is made to objectively justify the scoring of each is possible by related URL or top 0 results of Google keyword searches; also, download time for average web connections is quite fast at 4 seconds. Browsing reveals large amounts of rich, relevant, information on cage-diving travel packages in South Africa; yet the only visible date, September 003, raises questions on prices and itineraries changes. Some biased phrases, albeit intriguing, may reduce content credibility and objectivity; yet while UnrealDive assumes authorship, the no warranty is provided on contents. Basic use of graphics is seen with soft colours and irregular highlights to attract attention. Images are ample and rich in aesthetic worth, yet mostly small and can slow download time. The few videos available can only be seen by members, reducing site enjoyment. Even so, adequate use of grids, minimizes 'rectanglitis', and minimal scrolling makes for better browsing; yet little 'white space' and packed line width complicates reading. Average Accessibility conformance relates to an overemphasis on coloured, as well as small, font and images; affecting the visually impaired. While small, the Navigation bar layout eases usage and leads to various internal links, with some external, and few bad links; this is critical given the lack of search features. Limited value adding features include user comments, news letters, and the Shark-o-meter; all of which in English, possibly reducing personalization; currently done with cookies and user-registration. Online transactions require bookings which may delay transactions; yet the niche market and weather dependent activities may justify this absence, whereas lack of basic security measures is questionable. Principal - Shark Cage unaware of the site's URL can easily access the site with Google's top 0 search results, and with a download time of 9 seconds this is quickly achievable. Even if basic, the quality of site contents is quite rich; ranging from shark information, the ambience in which the dives take place, and the services provided by the Principal. Yet the issue of updated information and prices is questionable, with 004 being the most recent date available. Some bias is also evident with such words as 'legendary' and the bold claim 'an experience you'll never forget'; yet this may serve as promotional tactic posted by the authors of the site, Mammoth Solutions. Graphics are provided by way of rich images but they can only be viewed in small, built-in, windows; yet a virtual tour of a shark cage can compensate for this and increase a level of added value to users, which are otherwise quite basic. Even with soft colours and different font families, lack of weight and small size complicates reading; and despite average grid and web pages, tied to reduce scrolling, there is little difference in presentation or compact line width. The site shows average accessibility, with most warnings and errors linked to the site's use of images and colours to convey information; an area which may be improved for visually impaired users. Despite small menu size, navigation is simple, with internal links unaffected by bad links and connections to external sites, such as search engines, and a sitemap can improve search ability. Other than a FAQ page, and invitation to make bookings for more information or reservations, there is little evidence of personalization or online transactions; which are questionable due to a lack of basic security measures. Principal - White Shark to the latter, easier access is provided by Google's top 0 search results, in place of a complex URL; either way download time is fast at 1 seconds. The rich and relevant content pertain to a similar experience as the latter, yet offer extensive rates to choose from; and encouragingly, such prices are presumably recent given the last update is 005/8. Bias is also present, yet in such cases as relating to the boat and cages, the site attempts to justify this via performance figures. Site graphics include animations and images depicting sharks in action to attract attention, yet these may distract users and are of mediocre quality. Colours effectively contrast the different families of font, yet web links may be harder to see once clicked, with the color and font dissolving into the background; Even so the 'blue' space in this case leaves room for text to breathe and adequate line width, further supported with an organized use of grids and minimal scrolling. While adequately meeting Accessibility, the site requires to further support images used to convey information, for example boat interior, with captions. The sites internal links lead to respective pages without any bad links, which reduce scrolling and may ease navigation; yet a lack of external links may be seen as an attempt to restrain users from searching further. Indeed this leads to the criticism for a lack of tools to aid search capability. Similarly the site offers little in the way of value adding features, other than a price converter available for users to calculate future, foreign, payments. The site makes hardly any use of personalization however, and given the amount of information it is surprising that no secondary language option is provided. Finally, as in the case of the latter principal, the site requires a booking for reservations and so lacks a true online transaction and little evidence to suggest security and privacy measures. Principal - The Bishops' with average download time of 0 seconds, the site is not easy to access without using the hotel name in a search engines; thus an appropriate URL is needed. Yet the rich site content is useful to users, with relevant information on the hotel and neighbouring Cape Town attractions; accessible independently or via guided tours conducted by the hotel, complete with private chauffer. At first glance information seems dated at 004, yet hotel rates are posted in more recent dates which may ease decision making. With bias kept to a minimum, the site is credible, and willingly offers information on sister sites provided by the site authors; The Last Word resorts. While the images on the site are fairly small, the sites other graphics include various property videos, rich in detail and aesthetic value; yet these may be the cause of slower download time. Colour of both font and site background is soft yet may strain reading, owing to a centred layout which compacts both 'white space' and lined width. While grids are adequately used, the site and linked pages make little change in presentation. Yet this may inversely affect Accessibility, rated as average, owing to the improper sizing of images and font. Even so navigation bars in the top, side, and bottom of the site allow for rapid access to many internal and external links, with minimal obstruction by bad links. Yet, while a site map is included at the end of every page, search capabilities are limited to internal searches. Value adding features are relatively basic and include guest comments, local maps, and a news letter that users must sign up for; which may provide a level of personalization, albeit minimal. Final transactions require a booking which as previously indicated may not be a true online transaction and may delay the process, yet the boutique nature, and small size of the property may justify such a need. Yet the enquiry asks interest of visit which may be seen as invasion of privacy by some users, who may also question a lack of basic security measures. Principal - Auberge to the latter, an appropriate URL is required for easy access to the site yet a faster download time of 7 seconds is slightly more encouraging. Even so quality of content is quite basic, offering little in way of information mostly relating to immediate surroundings and local attractions; information concerning rates is also questionable, lacking in both relevant dates and authorship. Content shows bias in some cases and such words as Auberge and Provencal may mislead users to consider if this is a French or South African website. Images, although fairly elegant, represent the only form of site graphics yet their rather small size may leave little in way of value to site experience. Even with adequate use of soft colours, site layout suffers from rectanglitis; indeed even with links to highlight available services, the facilities web page is one such example. As with the latter principal, a centred layout may compact both 'white space' and line width. Relative to the areas previously mentioned, the site's average Accessibility warnings relate to areas of misleading use of language and small sized pictures. Site navigation is also average, despite small menu size, with mostly internal links free from bad links; yet offers no search capability features. Similarly, the site makes no use of value adding features or personalization which may deter future users. Once again the small size and boutique nature of the accommodations may require users to make bookings before any online transaction, with little evidence of security measures, or added guidance. Principal - Jock Safari a rapid download time of 1 seconds, this site is not easily accessible without the proper URL; indeed it only appears on page two of Google's results. Yet site authors, Manits Collection, provide rich and relevant content describing the lodge, its facilities, and up to date rates for 5/8-6; yet the claims of the lodge exceeding guest expectations may be somewhat biased. Graphics of added richness are available to users including images, animations, and four Virtual Tours; all of which can add to site enjoyment and value adding features. Despite its small size, the darker coloured font adequately contrasts with the background to aid reading; yet line width and white space is often compact which contradicts this affect. The site adequately uses grids however and allows for organized and differentiated presentation; also reducing excess scrolling. Yet despite such efforts, average Accessibility levels indeed relate to issues of size and positioning of text and images; namely thumbnail captions which are hard to distinguish. Despite such issues, the well structured navigation bar, with no dead links, connects users to internal and external sources that may aid search capability; the site map on the bottom of each page is such an example. Excluding virtual tours, the site makes good use of value adding features including local maps, and weddings arrangements; which, together with newsletter registration, are the few attempts to personalize user experience. While the site offers an online transaction link, this can be misleading as it refers users to a booking form, which may delay transactions and does not identify basic security measures. Similar to above mentioned sites, limited capacity and niche services may justify the need for bookings. Principal - South African the site's URL may be somewhat confusing, it is still accessible via Google's top 0 results and can be rapidly downloaded in seconds. The site contents are rich, straightforward, and relevant to the many aspects of the Airline; with a precise date available in the policy statement, the site ensures a level of updating is used. The objectivity of the authors, may be seen with the public display of financial figures of justify performance. Despite an adequate use of colours the small font size may make reading problematic and apart from a few logos, thumbnails, and seating plan images, the site makes very little use of graphics. Yet site layout is organized with the use of grids in to present information, tied with good use of white space to allow text to breath; in addition the site's quite small pages reduce excessive scrolling. Despite these efforts, average accessibility is due to some pages not meeting WAI guidelines; also automatic page refreshing may hinder disabled users' grasp of information. Indeed despite general and navigation layout, the site's navigation bar may overwhelm some users with a range of mostly functional internal and some external links; nevertheless navigation aids include a fixed main bar on top of every page and anchors. The search bar, while basic, offers visitors a fair amount of information on a selection of flights; nonetheless, this is the only search capability feature visibly available. At first glance the site appears to make no use of value adding features, yet they are available in the form of FAQ, the mentioned seating plans, flight delay information, and downloadable screensavers in the 'about SAA' menu. Indeed personalization is presumably of high value to this site, offering two languages, and various options for 'voyagers' or frequent travellers to choose from; that is once users register and via information gathering cookies. Online transactions are indeed presented in true form, with added levels of security and assistance which ease the process for a complex URL, the site can otherwise be accessed, and downloaded in 0 seconds via Google's top 0 keyword search results. Site content is quite rich and vast in relevant information on South African tourism and site authors, Cybercapetown, also act as aggregators by offering packages; encouragingly rates are presumed to be recent with 005/8 being the last known date. Graphics may be seen as average, with images used mostly as thumbnails and added animations, while small, are also evident in the site though they may be distracting. Colour use is quite effective, yet the often brighter background can be too contrastive with softer font colours and families. Site layout, while basic, suffers from rectanglitis and often compacts information with little line width; in addition, despite various links, the site requires excessive scrolling with no use of anchors. Indeed despite the site's efforts in presenting information, the inadequate sizing, positing, and use of graphics yields an average level of accessibility. Navigation is fairly straightforward and eased from either the main bar at the top of the page or various internal and external links; yet the main bar suffers from bad links, including 'Flights 'link simply refreshes the page. Nonetheless, the site's hot-spot maps not only ease navigation, but improve the already present search capabilities; including search bars and sitemap, yet even these are affected by errors. Other than the hot-spot maps, the site provides a five day weather forecast located on the bottom homepage; yet, these appear to be the only visible value adding features. Nonetheless, the site uses gathered user information, via automatic web server detection or submitted by users, to further personalize the online experience; yet policy statement is outdated at 002 and no further mention of this is made. Even so the final online transactions offer users good levels of guidance and demonstrate a sound level of basic security measures. Price Comparison: The Effective the literature review suggests, the internet has indeed impacted the pricing strategies of both Principals and Intermediaries. An objective of this assignment is examining such affects, and so a package aids in forming similarity levels for such a comparison. Yet the niche nature of the product, tied to some extent with still developing internet technology of South Africa led to further modifications of the channels discussed. Firstly, no Integrators could be found that offered the Principals' service related to cage diving; thus the creation of hybrid of combined price and brand these sites are relatively difficult to access via their often complex URL, supporting the theory that they may benefit from outsourcing their site design services to online intermediaries or infomeadiaries (La et al., 001). A recommendation of this nature however, has to be carefully considered, owing to the increased risk of brand dilution; assumed to be an already delicate element to this market. To this extent a more plausible recommendation would be to outsource to a specialized integrator, thus benefiting the companies through increased reach while providing those lesser effective sites the opportunity to possibly benefit from outside market intelligence. Such is the case with the Auberge Burgundy, among the weakest of sites, which under this assumption could benefit from outsourcing its site to an internet savvy integrator to effectively improve on the company site. Similar reintermediation would benefit the shark cage diving Principals, which as suggested by the analysis lack the opportunities to be accessed through integrators. Under this assumption, the Principals could thus benefit from increased visits via higher levels of access to the company sites by desired target markets. As with all the latter mentioned Principals a final recommendation, would be to provide basic levels of security and privacy measures. Even with the continued use of bookings such measures could entice users to consider the Principals further when making decisions, and gathering travel information. Additional personalization of site experiences to selected target markets could allow such niche companies to develop stronger levels trust and loyalty. The final issue of accessibility is an area which has affected all websites; indeed the web as a whole. While it may be argued that this particular package requires a certain level of fitness, the use of the internet in accessing information is not limited to able bodied individuals. Thus a final a recommendation is for the selected channels to pursue future goals in meeting the necessary guidelines to enrich the knowledge of all individuals. Ultimately the implications of the assignment present a considerable modification of the original travel package, and to some extent, may have skewed the overall findings and discussion. While in some cases modifications were inevitable, owing to technical errors of the web, some were more related to the incapability of certain channels to meet more specialized demands; a possible area for improvement for both Principals and Intermediaries. Nonetheless, the assignment demonstrates how the dynamic nature of the tourism industry, tied with distributive capacity of ICT phenomena such as the internet, have established new parameters of modern marketing and pricing strategy (Middleton et al., 001). Ultimately, developments in distribution channels provide the travel and tourism industry the means with which to better integrate the value of desired consumers; providing firms the opportunity to better design effective online services, transactions, and security measures to enhance the levels of required trust in exchanging valuable information over the increasingly important world wide web.""","""E-commerce and Travel Package Evaluation""","3869","""E-commerce has revolutionized the way we plan and book travel packages.

"370","""One of the most pressing problems in the developing world is the extent of population growth and the pressure that it exerts on the resources of the countries. The views in literature concerning this concentrate on the need of restrictive programs on fertility to be imposed by the government and on the other hand, the mechanism that more developed countries will automatically have less children through increased health care and education. This controversy is investigated empirically by Jean Dreze and Mamta Murthi in their article 'Fertility, education and development: Evidence from India' for panel data gathered from the surveys made in the states of India. I will review the article by first summarising the proceedings and then commenting on the findings. It can be found that although the paper is very thorough in the form of econometric analysis, the value of the findings in terms of new information is limited, with the exception of the relevance of the income variable. Dreze, J. and Murthi, M. 'Fertility, education and development: Evidence from India' Population and Development Review 7, The aim of the article is to address the role of female education, female autonomy, infant mortality and income to the number of births in the Indian states. This is done in a multivariate framework using district-level panel data on the two most recent censuses at the time, 981 and 991. They are concerned about the path through which the education-fertility relationship operates as it is not clear if this is a direct causality effect or if it stems from greater autonomy of women through education or if it is income related. Also the endogeneity of the variables is discussed since for instance female labour force participation may both lead to and result from lower fertility. The regression estimated by the authors is: The dependent variable is the total fertility rate in district d at time t, it is regressed on the intercept measuring a district-specific effect, a vector of explanatory variables, a time dummy and an error term. The explanatory variables are adult female literacy, adult male literacy, poverty, urbanisation, son preference, regional location and the social composition of population (castes, tribes, Muslim). The article finds that the connection between female education and fertility is robust and significant in terms of the size of the effect. Male literacy was found to be non-related to fertility. The role of son preference in keeping fertility high was also confirmed, as the incentive of additional births is higher especially when child mortality is high. Child mortality was found to be strongly linked with high fertility also in general. There was also evidence of a structural shift in the relation between fertility and the explanatory variables, possibly meaning the expansion of family planning programs, earlier developmental improvements or inter-district diffusion effects. Interestingly, none of male literacy, urbanisation or poverty was statistically significant implying that more than economic growth is needed to fight the population problem. The analysis technique used in the paper seems an appropriate and a sufficient way to approach these issues. Panel data methods used are good because they allow for the estimation of the model without too many considerations of common time series issues like autocorrelation. However, the regression coefficients that are represented in the several tables of the paper only tell so much about the actual relationships between the variables. If we take the surprising fact that poverty was insignificant for example, this might be a result of a wrong specification used as other studies have found evidence that income has a positive effect on fertility. Duflo and Udry find that when there was a positive shock on the crops controlled by women, the expenditure of the household on food and children went up. This did not occur when the crop was controlled by men. We can relate this to the poverty view that if there was more money available for women (for example, but not necessarily, through increased education), this would lead to more being invested on children and decrease child mortality, which was found to be an important factor influencing fertility. This inconsistency could be the result of the poverty measure not being accurate enough, the authors recognise the problems in having to interpolate the missing years as the poverty headcount index is only measured in intervals. What could be included is a measure that looks at income or expenditure more directly and then a dummy for women to see the possible separating effect. Duflo, E and Udry, C. 'Intrahousehold resource allocation in Cote d'Ivoire: Social Norms, Separate Accounts and Consumption Choices' NBER Working paper #0498 The authors state that it was not possible to include child mortality in the main equation because it is likely to be affected by the dependent variable and this would cause problems. The solution presented in the paper is to use an instrument to remove the inconsistencies. The authors suggest that access to drinking water is a viable instrument because it can be assumed to be highly linked with child mortality but not with to fertility. I think this can be contested as access to drinking water has a straightforward effect on the health of the population, therefore including the mothers and areas where the access is low are also likely to be poorer areas. In that case, the inclusion of the access to drinking water should affect the coefficient estimates on the regional dummies, son preference (if mother's health is poor they require more assistance to survive in the future), poverty and female literacy. When comparing the coefficients presented in tables this seems to be case, as these variables have increased in significance. This change is acknowledged in the paper but it is explained to be the cause of controlling for child mortality. The possible interference of the drinking water variable could also be recognised, although it is not likely to cause estimation problems because of the lack of perfect multicollinearity with any of the explanatory variables. As stated in the concluding remarks, 'the findings of this article consolidate earlier evidence on the connection between female education and fertility in India' (p.4). The additional value of this paper is the verified robustness of the fertility and education relationship, which is a relatively small accomplishment if we compare to the amount of analysis done. The approach itself is not very innovative but it manages to generate a conflicting result for income and additional value would have been added, had this been investigated further. The significance of the structural shift was also only introduced with a list of possible reasons without further consideration. After all, one of the reasons listed is the expansion of family planning programs and its role in reducing fertility, which was dismissed in the beginning of the paper by saying 'experiments with authoritarian intervention, by contrast, have had disastrous results' (p.4). However, these programs have increased in India during the time period of the paper and therefore their effect on the reduction in fertility should not be neglected, especially as a variable that possibly represents these programs appears significant in the equation. Contesting theories have been presented for example by Galor and Weil as they argue for multiple equilibria in fertility. Firstly, there is a low capital to labour ratio where women's wages are comparatively low and therefore the opportunity cost of having more children is lower. As many more children are born this also keeps the ratio down. The other equilibrium is a high ratio where the female wages increase and they have less children as a result. The ratio is kept high as a result of low population growth. To adjust between these equilibria a process of demographic transition is needed, this could also be what the structural time shift represents. Galor, O. and Weil, D. 'The Gender Gap, Fertility and Growth' American Economic Review 6, 74-87 In conclusion, the fertility issue in India has been very strongly linked with female education. According to findings in the paper, a big difference can be achieved by tackling female illiteracy but this does not work through increased female autonomy but directly by reducing the number of children per fertile woman. Cultural issues are often relevant and although the caste or religion effect was not that important in the results, it can be seen to work through the continued separation and inequality between men and women in the developing world. The fact that increased education for men has no effect whatsoever in fertility describes well the social norms in place for having children, mainly to ensure a required number of sons for old age security because of the lack of insurance markets and social security. In total, the contribution of this paper to the literature remains as a sort of summary of fertility related findings, listing the different theories involved but not going into too much detail in any field. The methods used for analysis seem robust and correct apart from some possible inconsistencies noted above. Also the shortcomings, possible problems and suggestions for further work were well acknowledged in the text and the topics were presented very clearly. The effect of economic growth still cannot be fully put aside, as trade increases and benefits of growth are more widely spread, globalisation can act to change the social norms and through that affect the determinants of fertility.""","""Population Growth and Female Education""","1785","""Population Growth and Female Education  Population growth is a critical global issue that has far-reaching implications for society, the environment, and sustainable development. One key factor that has been shown to have a significant impact on population growth is female education. By empowering women through education, we can positively influence population trends and create a more sustainable future for all.  Education is a fundamental human right that plays a pivotal role in shaping individuals' lives and the communities they belong to. When we specifically focus on female education, we uncover a multitude of benefits that extend beyond the individual level and have substantial implications for population growth and overall development.  First and foremost, educating girls and women has been consistently linked to lower fertility rates. When women are educated, they tend to have a better understanding of reproductive health, family planning, and contraception methods. This knowledge empowers women to make informed choices about their reproductive health, leading to reduced family sizes and lower population growth rates. Studies have shown that each additional year of schooling for girls can lead to a significant decrease in fertility rates, contributing to more sustainable population growth.  Moreover, female education has a cascading effect on various socio-economic factors that influence population growth. Educated women are more likely to enter the workforce, earn higher incomes, and contribute to their households' financial well-being. As a result, educated women tend to have fewer children as they can better provide for the ones they have, breaking the cycle of poverty and reducing the pressure on resources that comes with larger families.  Additionally, educated women are more likely to participate in decision-making processes within their families and communities. This empowerment translates into a better understanding of the implications of overpopulation and the importance of sustainable practices. By including women in discussions about family planning, healthcare, and environmental conservation, we can foster a culture of responsible population management that benefits both current and future generations.  In many parts of the world, gender disparities in education persist, with girls facing barriers such as limited access to schools, cultural norms that prioritize boys' education, child marriage, and lack of resources. Addressing these challenges and promoting female education is crucial not only for achieving gender equality but also for mitigating the negative effects of rapid population growth.  Investing in girls' education yields substantial returns, not just in terms of population control but also in promoting social progress and economic development. When girls are educated, they are more likely to delay marriage, have fewer children, and invest in their own children's education, creating a cycle of empowerment that uplifts entire communities.  Governments, NGOs, and international organizations play a vital role in promoting female education and addressing the root causes of gender disparities in education. Policies that ensure equal access to education for girls, provide incentives for families to educate their daughters, and train teachers to create gender-inclusive learning environments are essential steps in promoting female education and harnessing its potential to positively influence population growth.  Furthermore, partnerships with local communities, religious leaders, and other stakeholders are key to challenging traditional norms and attitudes that hinder girls' education. By raising awareness about the benefits of female education and fostering a supportive environment for girls to pursue their studies, we can break down barriers and create a more inclusive society where every girl has the opportunity to learn and thrive.  In conclusion, the relationship between population growth and female education is complex and multifaceted. By recognizing the critical role that education plays in empowering women, we can address the challenges posed by rapid population growth and work towards a more sustainable future for all. Investing in girls' education is not just a matter of human rights; it is a strategic imperative that can have a transformative impact on population dynamics, social progress, and environmental sustainability. By prioritizing female education, we can create a more equitable and prosperous world for generations to come.""","752"
"6998","""In the exploration of punishment in Greek tragedy, the targeted characters are ones of power; kings and the divine with the authority to administrate punishment to the guilty. Guilt commonly follows crime or sin and the level of justice in the given punishment must be assessed. For example, while a punishment is directed at a single person, it often affects the lives of many, which increases the severity of this penalty. The level of justice will assess the ability of people in power to make judgement and decisions. Euripides' Bacchae and Sophocles' Antigone display the capability of both man and the divine to error but the consistency lies in the authority of the gods. While man can be judged, the gods are the highest level of authority and are therefore able to design an image of justice that cannot be challenged by man. These are both fierce and bloody plays that do not attempt to disguise the conflicts between men, in the case of Antigone, while the dissonance lies between god and men in Euripides' tragedy. Euripides introduces the gods as brutal and vengeful figures in the opening of this play through Dionysus' explanation of his birth: Dionysus; he who Semele of yore, 'Mid the dread midwifery of lightening fire, Bore, Cadmus' daughter.Euripides, Bacchae, ed. by Stanley. Dionysus is keen to publicise the truth of his parentage to the doubting city of Thebes in order to establish himself as a new Olympian god who is worthy of their worship and praise. He believes that he is the son of the most powerful of all gods, Jove, who had an affair with Semele, Cadmus' mortal daughter. Dionysus implies a precarious birth which he later explains as the product of 'Here's immortal vengeance' (page ) against his mother. Many sources agree that Dionysus was the product of two mothers as, provoked by Here, Jove revealed himself to pregnant Semele who was struck down by the sight of the divine figure that mortals cannot endure. Euripides suggests that while Here's jealousy enraged the action, Jove's fury was the guilty, catalytic power that 'Struck dead the bold usurper of his bed' , forcing him to bear Dionysus in his thigh to save him. By blaming Jove for Semele's death, Euripides attaches a brutality, ruthlessness and disregard for human life to this god that will be echoed by his son during the play. This account warns of the inharmonious relations often found between humans and the divine and emphasises the superior power of the gods over mortals through divine intervention. Though Euripides weaves this information throughout the play, there are many sources for this mythological story: Nonnos, Dionysiaca, ed. by T. E. Pageal. (London: Harvard University, 940) pp.73-93. Andrew Dalby, Bacchus: A.9-2. Bacchus continues to prepare the audience for the tragic drama they should expect to unfold by emphasising his intentions in visiting Thebes:.soon I will terribly show That I am born a ' intentions are wholly destructive, directing a play which, 'rather than a cautionary tale, is a vision of total despair'. He doesn't only wish to convince the city of his power but intends to inflict a gruesome punishment on the people for their sinful behaviour and instigate fear in them like their fears of any divine authority. The target of Dionysus' vengeance is collective as he believes that each and every citizen is guilty of persecuting him, rejecting his name in holy prayer and denying him as a god. Ian Johnston, 'An Introductory Note to Euripides' Bacchae' (British Columbia: 001) < URL > p. Dionysus' first stage in his intricate plan of vengeance targets the women of Thebes who, possessed by their malicious leader, have been forced from their homes and reunited with the raw landscape where they perform Bacchic rituals involving dancing in bare feet and sacrificing animals. Their harmony with the bare mountains and the beasts erodes the barriers between humans and the natural world, portraying the women as wild, savage and uncivilised. Their transformation into maenads pollutes the rational, innocuous order of the Theban lifestyle. Diller describes the effect of the injection of Bacchanals into Greece as 'the colourful intermingling of wild ecstasy with calm tranquillity, of every day life with unaccustomed events' which 'constitutes both its attraction and danger'. The attraction of the Bacchic culture lies in its devotion to liberation but this detachment from the rigidity of the civil order infuses a dangerous chaos within the city. As the embodiment of customary political authority, Pentheus immediately perceives Dionysus as a threat to his city and spurns the 'womanly man' who has infected Thebes with 'a new disease' (3) that he is determined to control. Hans Diller, 'Euripides' Final Phase: The Bacchae' in Oxford Readings in Greek Tragedy ed. by Erich.5/88. As the leading representative of Thebes, it is inevitable that Pentheus will receive the greatest impact of Dionysus' punishment. However, he further attracts the angry god's vengeance by ignoring the advice of Tiresias and Cadmus who think it wise to demonstrate an outward recognition of the god even if 'he were no god' (2). Although these elderly citizens follow their own advice, this does not allow them exemption from Dionysus' cruel retribution. In particular, Cadmus is heavily affected as he is exiled from the race he established and the murder of his grandson terminates the future of his family. While these facts highlight the merciless nature of Bacchus who is quick to cut down anyone who doesn't immediately praise him, it is possible that this god refuses to save these individuals as he can see through their pretence. Cadmus admits personal motives behind his Bacchic celebration. He is concerned for his treatment by the gods in death that he fears is soon approaching and is delighted that his daughter is believed to have given birth to an immortal: It were a splendid falsehood If Semele be thought t'have borne a god; 'Twere honour unto us and to our race. (2)Considering Bacchus' treatment of Cadmus and Tiresias, there is no guarantee that, had Pentheus reacted differently to his intrusion, he would have been saved from the wrath of the unforgiving god. However, by actively opposing this force, Pentheus commences a heavily imbalanced war with the divine that originates from his desire to defend himself and his city from something he fails to comprehend: He has decided, out of human self-defence and on the basis of everyday experience, to fight the unusual force which is confusing and erupting, overwhelming and tearing people from their accustomed environment. (Diller, 'Euripides' Final Phase', p.64)Furthermore, he is outraged that someone should have the effrontery to undermine his authority over the city that he governs. Pentheus allows his anger to inspire a foolish hubris in him which guides his sense and judgment to a fight with the inevitable. Diller perceives that the winner of this fight will be dependent on who has the greatest measure of sophia which denotes 'the grasping of a situation or task and the ability to master it'. While Pentheus arrogantly believes he has a clear understanding of how to overcome the threat of Dionysus, Bacchus is realistically confident he will effortlessly triumph over his he is utterly blinded by his pride. In pursuit of conflict with a god, Pentheus is described as 'crazed' and 'at the height of madness' (3) by Tiresias who is frequently portrayed as the voice of wisdom and rationality. Dionysus and his foreign cultures have been condemned with similar descriptions throughout this play by both the chorus and Pentheus himself. Their irrational behaviour is just one of the numerous similarities these characters share: It is not difficult to make a case that, in those central confrontations between the two characters, Pentheus is having to deal with a part of himself, a part he does not recognise as implies that Pentheus' conflict with his cousin forms from a rejection of Bacchus as a member of his family as well as a divine figure. Following his capture of the women of Thebes, the object of Dionysus' punishment becomes narrowly focused on the individual, Pentheus. Firstly, Euripides creates dramatic irony by fooling the king into believing he is only a follower of Dionysus, rather than the god himself. He then further ridicules him by encouraging him to wear women's clothes after creating an earthquake that shatters Thebes to ruins. The peak of Dionysus' cruelty is in his design of Pentheus' death where the immortal delivers a double blow; not only is Pentheus killed by his citizens possessed by his enemy but his very own mother. Pentheus' last words before his death form a desperate plea to his mother to return to her senses and recognise him as her son: I am thy child, thine own, my mother! Pentheus, whom in Echion's house you bare. Have mercy on me, mother! For his sins, Whatever be his sins, kill not thy son. (3)Euripides conforms to a popular convention of Greek theatre by verbalising Pentheus' death through the narration of the messenger, rather than designing this tragedy to be visualised on the stage. While the complexity of this particularly bloody scene would have been the primary motive in the playwright's methods, simply an aural account of the action allows the audience to use their imagination which often feels more realistic and dramatic than simply a presentation of reality. Pentheus shows a failure to recognise the extent to which he is responsible for his own fall, expressing no guilt or regret. Therefore, it is difficult to perceive Pentheus as the tragic hero of this tale as he does not have the opportunity to reflect upon his actions. However, Schechner describes the actions of Agave, who, it can be argued, adopts the role of tragic hero in her brief but essential presence in the play: A boy is killed, by his own mother. Not only murdered, but mangled, cannibalised. The ecstatic mother innocently dances with the severed head of her man-son, not recognising him. Richard Schechner, 'In Warm Blood: The Bacchae', Educational Theatre, Vol. 0, No. p.15/8. It is not unreasonable to suggest that Agave is delivered the most severe punishment by Dionysus in this play as she performs unforgivable sins outside of her control. She then continues to inspire the audience's pathos by unconsciously expressing her delirium following her lethal actions. Most importantly, she is returned to consciousness to suffer the process of anagnorisis when she discovers the harsh reality of her hunt. I am no more the Maenad dancing blithe, I am but the feeble, fond, and desolate mother. I know, I see - ah, knowledge best unknown!While Pentheus suffers bodily torture, Agave experiences a mental agony that will be intrinsic to her being for the duration of her life. Diller suggests that the audience can particularly sympathise with Agave because, unlike her son, 'we learn nothing of her resistance' (Diller, 'Euripides' Final Phase', p.60). Her punishment is not terminated there either as Dionysus then thinks it appropriate to exile her and her family from Thebes. This is where the severity of this god is put into question as the audience is provoked to consider what kind of justice is administered here. Dionysus provides the people with a single warning in the play, towards Pentheus by advising him not to attempt to defeat this god. This is the only trace of mercy offered by this god who perceives his victory as a god in the devastation of a city and its people. Euripides displays a version of divine justice that breeches on insanity, greatly accentuated by the pleasure this god takes in wreaking his rage. In Sophocles' Antigone, Creon plays the role of an equally proud, power-driven king who allows these ambitious discrepancies to misguide his character towards a catastrophic error of judgement. In this drama, the brutality of the gods seen in the Bacchae is transferred to the humans who are shown to be just as capable of bitter vengeance. However, Creon demonstrates tremendous guilt and regret for his merciless actions, highlighting the essential difference between gods and mortals; mortals are human, who sin and evaluate their actions with a conscience that does not allow them defence against lamentation. When both heirs to the Theban throne are killed in battle, Creon feels inclined to establish his new authority as king with a merciless command to deny Polynices his burial following his traitorous actions to his fatherland. Creon invades the territory of the gods by rejecting an unwritten law that a dead body must be buried in order to be passed into the underworld. The king ambitiously attempts to overrule the authority of the gods who, he believes, are sure to support him in this decision as they are gods of the city who would not 'celebrate traitors'. However, Antigone correctly believes that the gods would fully encourage her actions and thinks Creon deluded to suppose that 'a mere mortal, could override the gods, / the great unwritten, unshakeable traditions' (2). Kitto suggests that Antigone 'is working with the gods, and the gods are working in her - exactly as Aphrodite, later, works in Haemon against Creon'. While there are no immortal characters in this play, divine justice is alternatively demonstrated in the actions of characters, including Antigone and Haemon but particularly in the warnings of Tiresias. The seer complains that the 'the public altars and sacred hearths are fouled' (11) with the carrion torn from the unburied corpse. He warns the proud king that the gods cannot possibly support this disrespect to their places of worship. More importantly, Creon has 'robbed the gods' (15/8) of a child of the earth and this injustice will only be resolved by surrendering a child of his own to them. While Creon is the leading power of Thebes, his decisions are also judged by the gods whose greater power allows them to justly punish the king. Sophocles, Antigone, The Three Theban Plays trans. by Robert.3. H.D.F.Kitto, Sophocles: Dramatist and. 7. Creon exhibits a hunger for cruelty in this play that increases in severity the more his pride and authority is challenged. In the king's opening speech he introduces his pitiless character by graphically describing his intentions for Polynices' corpse; that it become 'carrion for the birds and dogs to tear'. Creon understands that his law completely disrespects Polynices and his family but his concerns lie with the state. Knox reminds the contemporary audience of the common Greek reaction to Creon's punishment: He represents a viewpoint few Greeks would have challenged: that in times of crisis, the supreme loyalty of the citizen is to the state and its duly constituted authorities.Bernard Knox,  to Antigone', The Three Theban.8. While the explicit description is unnecessary, Creon's actions are not thoroughly irrational at this point. He demonstrates an unwavering dedication to the state in his promise of death to anyone who acts against the interests of Thebes by disobeying his law. However, when it is revealed that his law has been violated, he is outraged that somebody should have the nerve to undermine his authority and his pride guides him to irrationality. He is determined that someone should suffer the punishment of death, regardless of whether they are guilty. He threatens his sentries with death for failing to seek out the culprit and Antigone's misfortune becomes their fortune when she is caught. When the king is challenged by Antigone, he cannot bear that a woman should mock his authority and promises her 'the most barbaric death' (3). Ismene indicates that killing Antigone would severely punish his son, Haemon, who is lovingly devoted to her, but Creon does not at all intend to reconsider his decision. However, when Haemon appeals to Creon, it becomes clear that rejecting his son's wishes is more than a rejection of the interests of his family over the state. This interaction between father and son is very revealing of the king's motives in the deliverance of his punishment. Haemon intelligently begins a plea to his father by feeding his ego with praise, declaring that he is subordinate to his father in everyway and he will never hesitate to obey his word. Unsurprisingly, Creon thoroughly delights in these compliments until Haemon indicates his support for Antigone. Rather than asking Creon for mercy based on his personal interests, Haemon relates the grief of the city who wholly sympathise with Antigone as they believe she has acted gloriously. At this point, Creon proves the instability of his devotion to the state by expressing 'The city is the king's - that's the law!' (7). The king is determined not to expose any weakness by altering his decision on the words of others, which he considers to be secondary to his own. Whether his actions are supported by the city is of no interest to this leader who solely perseveres to establish his authority over the city. Creon seems to believe that the greater the punishment, the greater the fear, inspiring him to kill Antigone in front of his son's eyes. While Creon's intentions are utterly inhumane, he is certainly not the only character in this play who is guilty of irrationality. Antigone rashly decides to disobey Creon's command in the understanding that she will be punished with death. Kitto outlines Antigone's reasons for her rebellion as 'loyalty to her family, love of her brother, religious duty' and 'sheer physical and emotional revulsion against the horror' (Kitto, Sophocles, p.3). Antigone is single-minded, wilful and passionate, disallowing her to consider the sense in her sister's reasoned argument. Instead, she shames Ismene by condemning her for acting selfishly and betraying the interests of her family for the law of Creon. She provokes her into guilt by no longer referring to Polynices as 'our brother' but 'my brother' (3) and condemning her dishonour of the gods. Although Creon's punishment extends to a loss of marriage and children for Antigone, she shows little regret throughout the play, but rather an acceptance of the consequences of supporting her brother. When Creon finally regrets his decision and sees reason, it is too late for Antigone who, 'independent to the last, has chosen her own way to die'. (Knox, '', p. 3) Unlike Dionysus, Creon both receives and delivers punishment in this play as he is subordinated by the omniscient gods. His decision to abandon Polynices' body to the elements punished Antigone's family. and indirectly destroyed his own. He deservedly receives a twofold punishment in the loss of his son and wife in the final scenes of Antigone. Knox discusses the suitability of this punishment: His savage dismissal of the claims of that blood relationship Antigone stood for has been punished with exquisite appropriateness, in the destruction of his own family, the curses of his son and wife. (Knox, '', p.3)Creon, like Thebes in the Bacchae, has painfully learnt a humbling lesson. This lesson encompasses the importance of using wisdom, of finding a balance of reverence to the gods and controlling pride. This lesson could similarly be applied to Pentheus whose lack of wisdom and pride leads him to the inevitable task of challenging the gods. While man is blamed for the tragic consequences of Antigone, Euripides has been considered as 'a critic of the Olympian gods' (Diller, 'Euripides' Final Phase, p.5/86), suggesting that this play condemns the actions of irrational Dionysus. Both plays adopt the idea that, without rationality, power can be a dangerous thing to possess, both among humans and the divine.""","""Punishment in Greek Tragedy""","4287","""Punishment in Greek Tragedy  Punishment in Greek Tragedy is a central theme that reflects the moral values and societal norms prevalent in ancient Greece. The concept of punishment in these dramatic works serves as a mechanism through which characters face the consequences of their actions, often leading to their downfall. Understanding the significance of punishment in Greek Tragedy provides insight into the ethical dilemmas, human flaws, and the larger philosophical questions that these plays explore.  In Greek Tragedy, punishment is intricately linked to the concept of fate and the will of the gods. The notion of divine justice permeates these works, where the gods play a significant role in determining the fate of mortals. Characters who defy the divine order or commit hubris, an act of excessive pride or arrogance, are often punished by the gods in a way that is commensurate with their transgressions. This divine punishment serves to maintain the cosmic order and reestablish the balance disrupted by human defiance.  One of the most famous examples of divine punishment in Greek Tragedy is the fate of Oedipus in Sophocles' play """"Oedipus Rex."""" Oedipus, through a series of tragic events, unknowingly fulfills a prophecy that he will kill his father and marry his mother. When the truth is revealed, Oedipus blinds himself in a moment of despair and is subsequently exiled from Thebes. His punishment is not just retribution for his actions but also a realization of the inexorable power of fate and the limitations of human agency in the face of divine will.  The theme of punishment also extends beyond the realm of the gods to encompass the societal and moral codes that govern human behavior. In Greek Tragedy, characters often face punishment for acts that contravene the norms of their society or violate ethical principles. This form of punishment serves as a cautionary tale for the audience, highlighting the consequences of immoral or reckless behavior and emphasizing the importance of adhering to societal values.  An example of societal punishment can be seen in the character of Medea in Euripides' play """"Medea."""" Medea, scorned by her husband Jason, exacts revenge by killing their children, an act that goes against the fundamental bonds of motherhood and challenges the social order. Her actions lead to her isolation and ostracism from society, highlighting the severe repercussions of violating societal norms and the sanctity of familial relationships.  Moreover, punishment in Greek Tragedy is not merely a means of retribution but also a mechanism for catharsis – a purging of emotions and a moral cleansing for both the characters and the audience. The suffering and punishment endured by tragic heroes elicit a sense of pity and fear among the spectators, allowing them to confront their own vulnerabilities and mortality through the characters on stage. This emotional catharsis serves a didactic purpose, urging the audience to reflect on their own actions and the potential consequences of their choices.  The portrayal of punishment in Greek Tragedy also raises profound philosophical questions about the nature of justice, morality, and the human condition. The relentless pursuit of justice and the inevitability of punishment underscore the ethical complexities of human existence, inviting audiences to grapple with questions of free will, determinism, and the limits of moral agency. Through the suffering and punishment of tragic characters, Greek Tragedy explores the inherent flaws and contradictions of human nature, revealing the fragility of human aspirations in the face of cosmic forces beyond their control.  Furthermore, the theme of punishment in Greek Tragedy serves as a reflection of the cultural and historical context in which these plays were created. The ancient Greeks, with their strong emphasis on honor, duty, and piety, viewed punishment as a necessary corrective measure to maintain order and uphold the moral fabric of society. The portrayal of punishment in these tragedies thus embodies the values and beliefs of the ancient Greeks, providing a window into their worldview and ethical concerns.  In conclusion, punishment in Greek Tragedy is a multifaceted theme that embodies the intersection of divine justice, societal norms, and human frailty. Through the portrayal of punishment, these plays explore the ethical dilemmas, existential questions, and moral quandaries that characterize the human experience. By examining the consequences of actions, the inevitability of fate, and the complexities of morality, Greek Tragedy offers profound insights into the nature of punishment and its profound impact on individuals and societies.""","897"
"90","""QUESTION Outline and give examples of the marketing mix used by overseas firmsthat specialize in soft furnishing or table lamps and export them to theUnited Kingdom, and discuss how successful these controllable variablesare for the firms in terms of their success in exporting their goods. (,19words) INTRODUCTIONThe approach taken in this assignment is to understand the marketing mix used by a top Indian company in the soft furnishings market that exports its products to the UK and to analyze how they use the controllable variables to their advantage. The firm chosen is Fabindia. The company has been chosen on the basis different parameters like brand name, specialty of products etc. Though Fabindia is a well-known name in India and to some extent around the world, it has only recently ventured in to the export market, which gives us the opportunity to analyze and maybe predict its future course of action. American entrepreneur John Bissell founded Fabindia, expanded to fabulous India, in 960. The company is unique as all its products are sourced from '5/800 craftsman and artistes' (fabindia.com, 005/8) from all over India, mainly rural parts. Through this unique feature Fabindia has been able to keep alive India's traditional textile industry while creating a distinct style of its own. The product range of Fabindia includes furniture, lights and lamps, stationery, home accessories, pottery and cutlery. Only from September, Fabindia has extended exporting its products to 3 countries around the world including UK. MARKETING MIX'Your company does not belong in markets where it can't be the best' (Kotler 000:65/8). The above adage cannot hold truer than in the case when a company is trying to export its products. Identifying plausible markets and planning your foray into them can be an onerous task.. Product and product mixThe product is the most important element of the marketing mix of Fabindia. Right from the time it was founded in 960, its product offering is how Fabindia differentiates itself from the competition. Its product mix and branding and how Fabindia uses them to market effectively is discussed in the following section.. Product levelsThe first of three levels of the the core product that deals with what the buyer is actually buying. For Fabindia, providing the core benefit translates to providing furnishings to decorate homes. It is at the second level, when the actual product is formed and attributes like quality, features etc. are incorporated, that Fabindia has done exceedingly well. Fabindia aims for people who want 'fashionable products at reasonable prices ' (Fabindia.com/presskit) hence, it has made its offered product different from the g eneric product of home furnishings. (Levitt, 980). This differentiation appeals more to Fabindia's customers. The third and final level, augmented product is where Fabindia can make its presence felt in the UK. It has just started exporting via its e-commerce site, which has very basic offerings on warranty, delivery and credit aspects. Now, in order for Fabindia to do well it has to come up with attractive offers like delivery slabs of days /0 days/5/8 days and charge accordingly. This way it won't lose the competitive advantage it gains through it offerings at the actual product level.. Product MixEvaluating Fabindia's product mix on four parameters width, length, depth and placemats having variants. - All product lines of Fabindia are soft furnishings that go'through the same distribution channels i.e. either piecewise'through their website or through wholesale distribution, which makes them closely related hence consistent. Now, using the above product assortment Fabindia can expand on the following two while exporting: _ By expanding width by adding more product lines: The actual product width of Fabindia is huge, including tableware, lamps etc., but being a new entrant in the export market it has not offered many of its products. Fabindia will need to add more product lines to gain acceptance in a wider market segment. _ Considering demand of its exported products it can think of adding more distribution channels or even opening up stores in UK. This area has been dealt with in detail further in the assignment when the distribution strategy of Fabindia is discussed.. BrandingOf all the product considerations, branding is most important to Fabindia's exporting success. A growing market segment of people are aspiring to have and 'elite-life style' (Hassan and Katsanis, 995/8: 40) on a global scale, which can be cited as one of the reasons for Fabindia's success at the domestic and international level. Its success in branding can be understood if an analysis of the 'brand levels' (Kotler, 000: 04) is done: _ Attributes: Fabindia suggests a casual carefree and a free spirited attitude. _ Benefits: The brand provides a functional benefit of a high quality product and thus durable. The emotional benefit is of experiencing the culture of a country, India in this case. _ Values: Fabindia is associated with values like creativity and social responsibility providing employment to the poorer people of India. _ Culture: Fabindia represents the Indian culture standing for diversity, colour and uniqueness. _ Personality: Fabindia suggests a very vibrant, trendy and tasteful personality. _ User: Fabindia does not really suggest the age group of its target users but considering its price range and intellectual image its brand image would appeal to all age groups alike. In his article David Aaker clearly states that until and unless a company is facing a strategic threat or an emerging opportunity, it should not think about 'vertical extension of its brand or repositioning'. Fabindia has always branded itself as being a high quality, niche market company. This has partly to do with the quality of its products which are very high together with a feeling in people that they are wearing something authentically Indian. This can be cited as one of the reasons behind its success in exporting to countries like USA, Italy etc. Fabindia is replicating the same brand strategy in the UK, which can be seen on their website.. PricingThe importance of pricing cannot be over estimated in the success of any product, but in Fabindia's case it is more interesting as numerous small companies in the UK sell literally the same products having the same appeal at lower prices. In this section various pricing strategies of Fabindia that will help it cope with the new market will be looked at.. Value based pricingNagle and Holden in their book 'The strategy and tactics of pricing' write that 'it is important not simply to process orders at whatever price customers are willing to pay but rather to raise customers' willingness to pay a price that better reflects the products true value', which is what Fabindia exactly does. Customers buying Fabindia products buy-in to the value it has to offer rather than the price. Taking a look at the history of Fabindia's pricing strategy in India and abroad it can be found that it never gives away a discount on its products, which means that customer satisfaction is due to the inherent quality that the customer see in the product, rather than the discount. This helps Fabindia to steer clear of competition as its customers show loyalty.. Product line pricingFabindia is using a product line pricing it has well established price levels for its products. Each of its products has a price ranging from high to medium to low. This can work as a double-edged sword for the company as it might happen that customers associate the various price points to high, medium and low quality products or that Fabindia attracts customers from different classes having varying degrees of paying capacity. The Fabindia product brochure on its website clearly communicates the difference between for example, a high priced bed sheet for $35/8 and a low priced one for $ is on the look out for retail options. Fabindia has evolved from a producer-wholesaler-customer model to producer-retailer-customer as well as to a producer-customer model. Retailing has helped Fabindia successfully increase its turnover manifold and it is now a $ 6m has successfully regulated the type and number of intermediaries it has creating a distinctive dealership advantage. This might have a slight disadvantage, as when demand increases exclusive dealership would not be able to cope with it. The main export source of Fabindia has been or will be the direct marketing channel, in this case its e-commerce site. The use of the Internet means that Fabindia can reduce retail costs but in a segment like home furnishings people do want to touch and see a product before buying it, so, it cannot be a long-term strategy. For Fabindia delivery is also a crucial aspect because being a new entrant into the UK market on time delivery will increase customer satisfaction hence customer loyalty of its products. The delivery channel presently used by Fabindia is the courier services of the global company UPS International, which being reputed should help in delivering reliably. A combination of the above two models, direct marketing and retail, can work best for Fabindia in the longer term. This is true, especially in UK, as it is a new market for Fabindia and to sell more it does need to establish itself first. Once it has found a customer base and people want to shop again they can do it over the Internet. Also, Fabindia can sell those special products over the Internet that are not present in the retail store. This way it can maximize the advantages of both, retail and direct marketing.. WholesalingFabindia started as a wholesale export company and though it is focusing on retailing and direct marketing presently, it still carries out wholesale export orders especially for resorts, hotels and corporates. (fabindia.com/business). For wholesalers, the minimum order for export is $,00, of which 0 % is advance and the rest is routed through bank, preferably buy and finally to create a climate of consumer acceptance.' Fabindia does this very well, especially informing, educating and building trust with its consumers. The Fabindia website contains its press kit which allows any user to read about its past laurels and future plans. Facts about Fabindia's social responsibility or that it was awarded the Economic Times 'Indian Retailer of the Year' in 004 sure leave a positive impact. Recently Fabindia joined the 'Craftmark' tag, launched by a Non Government Organization, All India Artisans and Craftworkers Welfare Association, (Economic Times, 005/8) whereby all artisans who have made a handicraft will print their names on the product to protect its authenticity and to create an emotional bond with users, specially first time customers who do not know much about the company. CONCLUSIONThrough the above sections the marketing mix used by Fabindia was clearly established. The various strategies adopted by the company for its products, pricing them, distributing them and finally promoting them could be differentiated. While evaluating the success of these marketing mix strategies it was found that as Fabindia has entered the mainstream exporting market very recently, there is more of speculation regarding how successful it can be if it pursues the same methods. While speculating two clear trends were spotted: Retailing has helped them grow at 5/8% Compounded Annual Growth the past years and quadrupled their yearly sales from $m to $ 6m for the period 002-004. (Economic Times, 004). The success of Fabindia can be largely attributed to the quality of its products, which are its greatest selling point. Fabindia's success in the past clearly shows the importance of its product's quality and exclusive retailing strategy. Building upon direct marketing, if Fabindia opens retail outlets in UK then there is evidence to suggest that it will be able to repeat its success story. QUESTION Discuss the importance of the marketing strategy decisions made by yourteam during the Marketing Game. What do you consider to be the mainlearning points of the game? (,75/8 words) YEAR 6. Analysis of Year Innotech was the name assigned to team 's company for the marketing game. After looking at the market analysis it was decided that revenues for Innotech would come from either of three market segments namely typists, writers and managers, as they were willing to pay maximum i.e. 5/80, 60 & 00 respectively. Also, market research suggested that students wanted only cheap software, making them less lucrative while the home scribblers and concerned parents did not have enough market share collectively to attract Innotech. Examining the three was clear that unlike other had a heavy leaning towards the special commands configuration of the product. Another similarity between the three segments was that they bought their product heavily from channel making it simpler to distribute the workforce between the two channels, &.. Strategic decisions and Importance6. ProductInnotech decided to make a product configuration that would target all three segments, typist, writers & managers. So the configuration decided was C=5/8, E=, L= with a unit cost of 3. Our team was hoping to make a dent in all three segments rather than a niche market so selective specialization was the some wanted direct competitive advertising that 'influenced immediate purchase and built selective demand for the firm's own brand ' (Strategic Marketing class notes). In hindsight, preferring indirect advertising was a mistake as our team tried to influence our buyers' future purchase without building Innotech's brand name in the present. Almost 5/8% of our budget, 00,00 was spent on advertising, which should have been increased because competing in a tight market; advertising would have helped us gain a bigger market share. A substantial amount, 4,00 was allocated for dealers as part of sales promotion. This was because Innotech was a new entrant in the market and was facing heavy competition.. PriceWith a substantially high unit cost at 3, pricing had to be just right for all three target segments. Having fewer customers in channel, it was decided to keep a higher wholesale price of 88 for channel and lower for channel at 45/8 so that revenue could be maximised from prospective buyers. Consequently, the retail price for both channels was 90, which was a good price for our customers to pay per unit considering that they were looking for higher specifications in their product.. ImpactIn Year our team managed a good profit of 85/8,5/84. Our strategy of targeting the higher paying capacity segment customers worked and Innotech managed to sell all of its 4003 produced units. YEAR 7. Analysis of Year Analyzing results of year the following key points were observed that formed a basis for the strategy decisions of year: a. Innotech had the highest market share with the writers but only by a razor thin margin. This meant that though the targeted segments were hit, stiff competition followed. Wordsoft, who had a product configuration close to ours, were doing very well in the segments targeted by Innotech and had highest overall sales. b. Innotech had the lowest production volume and as a result lowest volume of sales, but it made a good profit, which meant that our price was right for the customer. Also, all four teams priced in the same bracket as Innotech making it a very tough market to be in. c. Analyzing Wordsoft, which had the highest profit for year, it was seen that they had a higher advertising budget and lower sales promotion budget as compared to Innotech. Also, they went for direct advertising, which helped them garner larger profits.. Strategic decisions and Importance7. ProductAs our product had been successful in year, the configuration was not tinkered with and kept the same. Securing a profit and forecasting higher demand prompted us to ramp up production by,00 units to 0,00 units.. PlaceAnticipating higher competition for our products, more sales people were hired to market our product aggressively. To incentivise them, a commission rate of % was decided upon. As our business was more via channel, so out of the extra sales people, went in channel and in channel. Also, higher demand meant increasing the exposure goal to &, for channel & respectively making the distribution more intensive.. PromotionThe money spent on advertising was increased from 00,00 to 00,00 but type of promotion was retained as indirect advertising. This was done because in our quest of maximising profit & market share, promoting our company aggressively was very important. The same logic was applied to the sales promotion budget, which was nearly tripled to 0,00 for year.. PricePricing was by far the most conspicuous strategy change by Innotech for year. Comparing our results with our competitors it was found that among our target segment of writers, typists and managers, a good market share was gained only in two segments i.e. of writers and typists. It would not have been very beneficial to target managers as Fantastic had a major presence in that, it was decided to concentrate on our customer base. The remaining segments had some presence in channel and hoping to gain market share in channel, retail price was reduced from 88/unit to 5/80/unit.. ImpactThe strategy of reducing the price in channel worked very well as also did the decision to increase advertising costs as our sales from channel doubled in comparison with year, raking in a profit of 90,75/8. Innotech produced more than its predicted demand of 0,00 units and produced 6,00 but it managed to sell all the units. Innotech also gained on the writer's market share and had a dominant lead in that category with 5/8. %. YEAR 8. Analysis of Year Analyzing results of year the following key points were observed that formed a basis for the strategy decisions of year: a. Inspite of having profits and a major share in the writers segment, our team was rd in a race of as far market share by sales was concerned. b. Both teams ahead of us in the market had higher price as they were clearly targeting the manager segment that had a higher paying capability. Also, they had higher advertising budgets compared to us.. Strategic decisions and Importance8. ProductOur team was of the opinion that it had created enough loyalty in the writer's segment to keep them coming back to us and in order to increase sales it was decided to follow what Wordsoft was doing i.e. cater to the manager market. Hence having gained a good market share of the writer's segment, it was decided to make our product more suitable for the managers and change the product to C=6; E=; L=. The production for our new configuration was increased only by,00 units to 3,00 as entering a new segment required more restraint on our part.. PlaceAfter increasing production to 3,00 units more people were added into the sales force, putting person in channel and people in channel. A strategic error was made at this point, as when our target were the managers who anyway did not buy from channel, sales force should have been increased in channel. Also as Innotech was aiming a new segment, it should have distributed aggressively by changing its exposure goal.. PromotionDeciding to increase the advertising cost by,00 was not in proportion to the risk of entering a well-established segment but it was pursued. Trying to emulate the successful strategy of Fantastic, there was an increase in the sales promotion budget by 0,00.The advertising was changed to reminder type for year, thinking that customers have become conscious of the brand and it would need just a reminder to keep them interested in Innotech.. PriceAs the manger segment was being targeted in year, there was a deliberate increase in the channel retail price. Our competitors were having a much higher price at 15/8, but increasing our price to that level would have meant a wipe out from the other segments. Hence, to retain our customers and gain new ones it was decided to settle on an in between price of 99.. ImpactThe results of year were surprising insofar as our profits were halved from year and our market share by sales eroded by %. Worse still, was the fact that the writer's segment, where Innotech was leading the previous remained third in the market, which meant that our strategy of entering a well-established segment did not do well. YEAR 9. AnalysisAnalysing results of year the following key points were observed that formed a basis for the strategy decisions of year: a. The disappointing results of year showed us that there was no point targeting segments that were not our strength, especially where one team is overwhelmingly dominant. (Fantastic with 6% market share with managers) b. Underestimating the importance of advertising had proved costly for Innotech, especially compared to other teams who were spending more on advertising and doing better. c. For the past two years our production line had to produce more than what was asked for which meant that there was more demand for our product. It was only a matter of taking a calculated risk by increasing production.. Strategic decisions and Importance9. ProductThis time having learnt our lesson, it was decided to change the configuration to suit only one target segment of the writer's and make it exactly according to their requirements. Also, as lowering configuration would not have cost money, the specifications were modified to C=4; E=; L=. Wanting to market our product very aggressively production was increased from 3,00 to 5/8,00 units.. PlaceReducing the sales work force was a decision taken to keep our expenses in control because Innotech had shot up production expenses heavily. As the writer's bought in a 0:0 ratio from channel &, channel strength was kept same at 0 people but three people were fired from channel reducing the workforce to 5/8 people. As a result exposure goal was reduced to while still retaining the intensive distribution strategy.. PromotionThe long overdue increase in budget finally came about when advertising costs were increased to 94,00. As our competitors had advertised heavily and kept ahead of us marketing heavily was imperative for Innotech. Also, this increase would have helped us to win back the market share we had lost. The type of advertising again changed from reminder advertising previous year to indirect advertising, as it had proved successful in the past. The sales promotion budget was also pushed up slightly to help us win back our customers.. PricePricing strategy was again a topic of much discussion for Innotech as some members argued that price should be increased to maximise profit. But due to the quantum leap in production from previous years, lowering the price was a better option. Also having to target the writer's, price was set in accordance with their needs. In the end the average retail price in channel was lowered from 45/8 to 37 whereas channel price remained the same.. ImpactUndertaking a very high risk - high gain policy worked tremendously well for us and our profit reached nearly m in year. Speculating the demand of our products correctly, all of our 4,00 units produced were sold. The biggest strategy decision that worked well for our team was to target one segment, in this case the writer's, and making a tailor made product for them that made them buy heavily from us. 0 CONCLUSIONOverall Innotech came second at the end of year, but in the process learning a number of important lessons in marketing and its application in the real world. These are summarised below as learning points. a. Niche marketing Marketing has changed over the years from one being centered on higher market share to being centered on creating more customer than thinking about entering a totally new market segment where the competition has already taken a chunk of the market share. c. Risk taking Though it is unnecessary to take undue risks, but incorporating risk taking into the marketing strategy can be extremely useful as it can create new markets by producing new demand that never existed in anybody's mind before. d. Market research In Innotech's case the market research data obtained could not be very significant as its most important stage, the problem definition not thought about. Hence Innotech ended up paying money for data that was not required. The significant lesson learnt from this was that data is only useful when it is needed and market research should never be carried out just for its sake. e. Advertising It is extremely important to put a lot of emphasis on advertising because in a competitive market reaching out to more people helps foster more customers. In doing that advertising plays the most pivotal part as it puts the company's message across to more and more people creating the required buzz.""","""Marketing Mix and Export Success""","5061","""Marketing Mix and Export Success  Marketing plays a crucial role in the success of any business, and when it comes to exporting products or services to international markets, understanding and effectively implementing the marketing mix is paramount. The marketing mix is a strategic framework that encompasses the various elements a company can control to influence its target market's purchasing decisions. By carefully crafting and executing a well-thought-out marketing mix, businesses can increase their chances of export success and establish a strong foothold in global markets.  The marketing mix comprises the 4Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. Let's delve into each of these components and explore how they contribute to export success:  1. Product: The product is at the core of the marketing mix. When exporting products, businesses need to ensure that their offerings meet the needs and preferences of the target market. This involves adapting products to suit local tastes, preferences, and regulations. Companies must conduct thorough market research to understand the specific demands and requirements of the target market. By tailoring the product to meet local needs, businesses can gain a competitive edge and enhance customer satisfaction.  Moreover, ensuring product quality, reliability, and uniqueness are essential factors in export success. Products must meet international standards and regulations to gain acceptance in foreign markets. Investing in research and development to continuously improve products can also help businesses stay ahead of the competition and meet evolving customer needs.  2. Price: Setting the right price is crucial when exporting products. Pricing directly impacts market positioning, profitability, and customer perception. When entering new markets, businesses must consider factors such as local pricing norms, competition, exchange rates, and purchasing power parity. Pricing strategies may vary based on market segment, distribution channels, and economic conditions in the target market.  Discounts, promotions, and pricing incentives can be used to attract customers and stimulate demand. However, businesses must strike a balance between offering competitive prices and maintaining profitability. Conducting thorough pricing analysis and periodically reviewing pricing strategies can help businesses stay competitive and maximize export revenue.  3. Place: The """"place"""" element of the marketing mix refers to distribution channels and how products reach customers. Establishing an efficient distribution network is crucial for successful exports. Businesses need to select the right distribution channels based on factors such as market reach, customer accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.  When exporting products, businesses can choose between direct and indirect export channels. Direct exporting involves selling products directly to customers in foreign markets, while indirect exporting utilizes intermediaries such as distributors, agents, or partners. The choice of distribution channel depends on factors such as market entry barriers, operational capabilities, and market knowledge.  Furthermore, leveraging e-commerce platforms and digital marketing can expand market reach and provide an additional channel for reaching international customers. Investing in logistics, warehousing, and supply chain management is essential to ensure timely and efficient product delivery to customers worldwide.  4. Promotion: Promotion plays a critical role in creating brand awareness, generating demand, and driving sales in export markets. Effective promotional strategies help businesses communicate their value proposition, differentiate themselves from competitors, and build strong brand equity. Promotional activities may include advertising, public relations, personal selling, sales promotions, and digital marketing.  When promoting products in international markets, businesses need to consider cultural differences, language barriers, and local communication preferences. Tailoring promotional messages to resonate with the target audience while maintaining brand consistency is key to successful marketing campaigns.

"267","""What characterises the aerial view of the Wars of Independence is confusion: a sprawling area of uncertainty and strife undergoing great upheaval in a time of revolution and counter-revolution, grand mountain crossings of polyglot armies over the impermanent borders of ill-defined fledgling states. A landscape of general disarray and division between foreign and local, between races and classes and between different social groups with shifting allegiances, political or otherwise, in a war of huge scale and all-encompassing reach, basically a scene of chaos. What further adds to this confusion is the continued stubborn refusal of Latin American history to fit neatly into anything near a consistent and simultaneous chronology, the different areas reaching independence in their unique ways with individual consequences and in their own sweet time. The ebb and flow of forces that can be broadly categorised as separatist or royalist results in a back-and-forth struggle that cannot be used as evidence for the ascendancy of momentum or the inevitability of victory for independence, as the example of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, under Spain until the 898 Spanish-American War, testifies. To extract from this cross-continent jumble some 'principal processes and patterns' of the independence period could be a hazardous task where care must be taken not to succumb wholly to indulgent narratives of an awakened nationalism, or detached explanations of economic and social Creole self-interest, and not to slip into a euro-centric focus and understanding of this genuinely American phenomenon. While the individual paths taken to independence must be constantly remembered as a demonstration of diversity in the region, the fact remains that root causes and processes are similar among all of them, and the key to discerning the pattern in the chaotic mass of conflicting information and issues is realising that it is possible to do too much analysis. That is, to treat every contradiction as a nullification, to see every exception as a parallel trend of equal importance, in effect, cluttering the facts with sheer information. This is especially applicable with the non-uniformity and lack of depth that the Wars of Independence seemed to have in their causes, but it needs to be controlled, because independence could occur without the deep roots easily pointed to as causation, it is possible for small groups of dedicated people to radically change history, and that is what is underestimated in the analysis of the Wars of Independence in the face of the slightly unsatisfactory 'heavyweight' factors of nationalism, colonial society and European influence. Williamson, E., The Penguin History of Latin America, (London, 992) p223 Hamnett, Brian, 'Process and Pattern: A Re-Examination of the Ibero-American Independence Movements, 808-826', JLAS, vol. 9: p.79 A very credible, if euro-centric, understanding can be reached of the causes of the Wars of Independence as having all to do with events in Paris, Madrid, Cadiz and the rest of the old world. This can primarily draw from the unavoidable fact that before the Peninsular War and the crises of legitimacy that it provoked, there was little serious prospect for an independent Spanish America. While Tupac Amaru's campaign was large-scale and threatening, it lacked a definitive objective and must therefore be classed as simply the most significant of the various rebellions under Spanish rule. With the colonial authority split between the new crown of Joseph I and the Supreme Junta, the cabildo abiertos of the Americas found virtual independence thrust upon them, but still they took time before realising that Royalist reaction was going to rob them of their new-found influence and mobilise to assert their independence. This combined with the contrast of the relatively peaceful state of Portuguese Brazil which 'shows how much difference the King's presence could make' demonstrates the undeniable contribution of European separation and the resultant power vacuum towards the Wars of Independence. However, to stress the abrupt release of the Spanish grip over Latin America as the principal cause of their revolt is to overestimate the American desire to be free for freedoms sake; the history of the Spanish provinces shows that foreign rule did not have to be ever present to ensure order, as long as a significant portion of the population was content and they did not have expectations for anything better. Chasteen, John Charles, Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin.7 In that respect it was not simply the Spanish abdication that primarily caused independence, but the combination of the Bourbon reforms that demanded more collectively of the Indies, and also embittered the career-limited Creole to whom 'how irrational his exclusion must have seemed'. This tightening and thereafter enforced loosening of the Spanish fist resulted, as all things do when pressured and given a release, in a burst of energy and frustration, the Creole sense of rejection by his ethnic and cultural brethren prompting a more local search for validity and identity, and of course to supplant the peninsulars as the top rung in the social hierarchy. This is why in assessing the doubtless huge importance of Europe as a factor in the Wars of Independence, it must go beyond simply charting the events of the independence period as prime movers, but requires 'a broader periodisation' from the second half of the eighteenth century to note the 'significant readjustment of the Atlantic world' in the gulf that is created between the Spanish rulers and administrators and their natural allies in oppressing the other classes and races of Latin America. Anderson, Benedict, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism,.8 Hamnett, Brian, 'Process and Pattern: A Re-Examination of the Ibero-American Independence Movements, 808-826', JLAS, vol. 9: p.82 Since white attitudes and post-independence developments indicate that the majority of Creoles had no interest in revolution for an egalitarian society, they simply wanted a change of leadership, it is ironic that the downtrodden peoples of Latin America were used as the greatest symbol for the Wars which benefited one group of their superiors over another. In order to create an image all 'Americanos' could fight for, the liberators invoked the spirit of the 'European fantasy of the 'gentle savage' dependent for her salvation on Creole heroism', conveniently or perhaps hypocritically forgetting the Creole descent from the Conquistadors now suddenly despised, 'to turn elsewhere for an alternative myth'. This was necessary, however, because of the unlikelihood of nationalism in the cause of independence: 'people who shared a common language and common descent with those against whom they fought' banding together with the groups they had previously exploited daily and leading them in the name of some intangible common background that could not be ethnic, cultural nor political as long as popular sovereignty was delayed and denied. All they had was a common birthplace, and this formed a devotion to the land that manifested itself in exalted inhabitants of that geography, as in Peru where 'the creoles regarded themselves as the true heirs of the Araucanians' and saw that link as a more valid descent that legitimised their cause. Platt, Tristan, 'Simon Bolivar, the Sun of Justice and the Amerindian Virgin: Andean Conceptions of the Patria in Nineteenth-Century Potosi', JLAS, vol. 5/8: p.70 Chasteen, John Charles, and Joseph Tulchin, eds., Problems in Modern Latin American.0 Anderson, Benedict, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism,.7 Anderson, Benedict, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism,.8 In defence of Creole nationalism, that similarity of birthplace can count for a lot in a society where culture and attitudes cannot quite remain impermeable no matter what the social and ethnic divides, and strictly speaking is the same criteria on which most people would base the 'original' nationalism of European nation-states. Even despite the fact that it is mostly a negative definition where mere rhetoric and finger-pointing 'constructed a simple dichotomy: Americans versus Europeans', that should not diminish its power, negative integration being a powerful tool and one of the easiest to mobilise: they are the peninsulars, we are the Chileans/Argentineans/Mexicans etc, and therefore we must have our nation. The differing aims of the independence fighters is also a factor that affects the unity, but not the validity of the movement's nationalism, Creoles in the main wanting autonomy and influence while 'Indian.groups looked to Republican legislation to ensure the curtailment of colonial abuses'. What this signifies is that a unified groundswell of support with kindred motives was not necessary so long as the force was concerted in 'a certain project of nationhood pursued by a small Eurocentric elite in the face of a massive ethnic majority with its own ideas about the significance of independence'. Chasteen, John Charles, Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin.00 Platt, Tristan, 'Simon Bolivar, the Sun of Justice and the Amerindian Virgin: Andean Conceptions of the Patria in Nineteenth-Century Potosi', JLAS, vol. 5/8: p.67 Platt, Tristan, 'Simon Bolivar, the Sun of Justice and the Amerindian Virgin: Andean Conceptions of the Patria in Nineteenth-Century Potosi', JLAS, vol. 5/8: p.66 When those differing ideas turn into opposition is where the argument of a progressively unified nationalism sparked by European detachment cannot totally convince. The large majority of the population that were Indian, African or mixed were not a dependable ethnic bloc, they had no allegiances except to themselves, especially not to the revolutionaries, who they sometimes resented more since 'the Creoles were the masters and overlords who exploited them directly, in daily life'. In turn the Creole landowners, far from trying to encourage a political motive and thereby enlist the sympathies of the lower classes, were afraid of their mobilisation, a fear of revolution and ethnic uprising beyond their limited demands and beyond their control, 'one key factor initially spurring the drive for independence from Madrid'. There was a mutual dislike, racial, social and political in nature, between the classes that prevented wholesale unity, if that was ever likely, and enabled the use of local forces for the purpose of reaction. Despite appeals to nationalism and liberty, the forces for independence found it hard to keep all the lower classes in their coalition, 'the fact that Chileans of the lower class could fight on the royalist well as on the patriot side shows that patriotic sentiment had not penetrated very far below a certain level of society'. This is another blow to the narrative of a growing national movement that drove out the 'foreigners' in that the Spanish come-back of 815/8 and 816 was partly because 'she won the support of slaves in the former, and of Indians in the latter, in the struggle against insurgent creoles'. This illustrates the gulf between the rungs on the social ladder, but it is also important to note that the Creoles were not a homogenous group all bent on repudiating colonial rule in the spirit of the Enlightenment and towards Republicanism. The mundane truth is that they were mostly landowners and the privileged, natural conservatives in fact, so 'the French Revolution and the example of Haiti brought home to the white elites of the colonies the value of the Crown as a guarantor of law and order within their own racially divided societies'. It is important to see the independence as much a reaction to threats on the status quo as an adapting of Enlightenment ideas and that conservatism as much as revolution was on the minds even of those who pushed for separation. Chasteen, John Charles, Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin.9 Anderson, Benedict, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism,.8 Chasteen, John Charles, and Joseph Tulchin, eds., Problems in Modern Latin American. Anderson, Benedict, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism,.9 Williamson, E., The Penguin History of Latin America, (London, 992) p210 That discongruity however, is the problem when analysing the independence movements, there are so many contradictions among what are surely the root causes that it seems as if there is a 'thinness' to the causation that does not convince of their contribution. What needs to be recognised is that the history of this era in this region was not inevitable and because it could have happened either way so it is legitimate to attribute success to the tip of the iceberg, namely the vanguard of revolutionary success. At the very pinnacle, Simon Bolivar and Jose de San Martin do embody the nationalistic spirit and were Enlightened gentlemen of Republican and Liberal credentials, and so it is not necessary to demand of the deeper social and political factors a consistent and pro-active evidence to be overwhelmingly causative. Those factors can be contradictory and disunited, they just need to have some amount of conduciveness for inspired a dedicated cadre to work from them and produce results. In analysing the causes of the Wars of Independence, it is too easy to get lost in the myriad of different factors and counter-factors to take into account, that focus can be distracted from how the significant difference was made, just because there are other vital contributions to consider also. Undoubtedly Nationalism, the effect of Colonial rule on society, and the European influence of ideas and events were root causes, indispensable to the necessity of independence, but they were consistent only with the general landscape of confusion and contradiction in the first half of the nineteenth century in Latin America. What they contributed, without having to be indisputably convincing in their primacy, was the support they gave to those who drove the revolutions and shaped this fledgling and ill-defined world. Their conducive facets and manifestations provided the elements for the decisive vanguard to lift support from them and push on to give these half-supportive factors the momentum and human inspiration to start and complete the Wars of Independence.""","""Latin American Wars of Independence Complexity""","2893","""The Latin American Wars of Independence, spanning from the early 19th century to the mid-1820s, marked a tumultuous period in the region's history as it sought to break free from the shackles of Spanish colonial rule. This complex series of conflicts involved a myriad of factors that shaped the course of events and the eventual outcome of independence. From social disparities and racial tensions to geopolitical interests and ideological clashes, the wars of independence in Latin America were not only about securing political autonomy but also about defining the future of the newly emerging nations. By delving into the multifaceted nature of these wars, we can unravel the intricate tapestry of Latin America's struggle for freedom and the complexities that accompanied it.  One of the fundamental aspects that contributed to the complexity of the Latin American Wars of Independence was the diverse social fabric of the region. Latin American society during the colonial period was hierarchically structured, with a small European elite wielding power and influence over the indigenous, African, and mixed-race populations. This social stratification laid the groundwork for deep-seated grievances among the marginalized groups who bore the brunt of colonial exploitation and discrimination. The struggle for independence thus became a rallying cry for those who sought to dismantle the existing social order and establish a more inclusive and equitable society.  Furthermore, the issue of race played a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of the wars of independence. The diverse racial composition of Latin American populations, resulting from centuries of intermingling between Europeans, indigenous peoples, and Africans, underscored the complex nature of identity in the region. The marginalized groups, including indigenous peoples and Afro-Latinos, often found common cause in the fight against colonial oppression, highlighting the intersectionality of race, class, and ethnicity in the quest for independence. The tensions stemming from racial inequalities added another layer of complexity to the conflicts, as different factions vied for power and influence in the emerging nations.  Geopolitical considerations also loomed large in the Latin American Wars of Independence, as various external powers sought to exploit the turmoil in the region for their own strategic interests. The Napoleonic Wars in Europe had a ripple effect in Latin America, leading to power vacuums and political instability that emboldened independence movements across the continent. European powers such as Britain and France, as well as the United States, eyed Latin America as a valuable economic and political prize, further complicating the struggle for independence. The intricate web of alliances and rivalries among external actors added a layer of complexity to the conflicts, as competing interests converged and collided on the Latin American stage.  Ideological conflicts also infused the wars of independence with added complexity, as competing visions of nationhood and governance clashed in the heat of battle. The Enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity inspired many of the independence leaders who sought to create republics based on democratic principles and constitutional rule. Simultaneously, conservative forces, including landowners and clergy, sought to preserve the traditional social order and resist radical changes that threatened their vested interests. The ideological divide between liberals and conservatives, coupled with regional variations in political outlook, fueled internal discord and hindered efforts to forge a unified front against colonial rule.  Moreover, the legacy of colonialism and the enduring influence of the Catholic Church posed significant challenges to the nascent nations seeking independence in Latin America. The entrenched power structures of the colonial era, including the encomienda system and the dominance of the Church, persisted in shaping social relations and economic dynamics even after the formal end of Spanish rule. The struggle to disentangle the colonial legacy from the fabric of society and governance required delicate negotiations and compromises that often eluded the independence leaders, leading to tensions and conflicts that hindered the consolidation of power and the establishment of stable institutions.  The economic dimensions of the wars of independence also added a layer of complexity to the conflicts, as competing visions of economic development and resource exploitation clashed in the crucible of war. The extraction-based economy of the colonial era, which relied on the exploitation of natural resources and forced labor, gave way to new debates about industrialization, trade relations, and land reform in the post-independence period. The challenge of building viable economies and sustainable livelihoods for the newly independent nations became a pressing concern that tested the ingenuity and resilience of the leaders and populations alike.  In conclusion, the Latin American Wars of Independence were a complex and multifaceted series of conflicts that embodied the struggles and aspirations of a diverse and dynamic region seeking to chart its own course in the world. The interplay of social, racial, geopolitical, ideological, institutional, and economic factors shaped the trajectory of independence and laid the foundation for the modern nations that emerged from the crucible of war. By exploring the complexities of these wars, we gain a deeper appreciation for the challenges and triumphs of the independence movements and the enduring legacy they have left for future generations to ponder and build upon.""","985"
"6076","""'. I, the Emperor, am with you, my subjects.and we are bound together with everlasting trust and respect for each other, not simply according to myths or legends. Nor is it on the basis of a fictitious belief that the emperor is the living god, and the Japanese nationals are superior to all the others who are destined to rule the whole world one day.'Officially called 'Imperial Rescript on Establishment of New Japan', translated by myself. In the original text, an honorific form of first person pronoun which only the emperor was allowed to use was employed throughout the script, and for the second person the form to address the lower class than the speaker was used. Hence my insertion of 'the Emperor' and 'my subjects' after the first and second pronouns respectively, since English does not have equivalent forms. The original be obtained from Tamura, 'Tenno no Ninngenn-Senngenn' The statement above is the so called 'Ninngenn this system, because of its ability to include an almost unlimited number of gods into its religious system, the nature of the gods can be very ambiguous, even to the level that deity could include anything which is beyond a human being. The classic example of this fluidness of the concept of the divine can be seen in the New Testament, where St. Paul and Barnabas received the divine respect from the public following their performing a miraculous healing of a lame man in Lystra. An interesting incident can be found in Japanese Shinto history as well, in which the death of a political authority who had been demoted from the position in the central government to the regional one just before he died, was associated with the series of unexplainable calamities and natural disasters that happened in the capital and the honour of apotheosis was given to him by the people who thought that the cause of disaster was the fury of the dead. From this respect, we could probably argue that the only one type of god unacceptable for polytheism is the one which tries to eliminate the other deities, such as the Christian God. NT Acts 4:-3 Jinjya-Honcho Outside this polytheistic view of religious matters, there were several other traditions rooted in Rome and its empire which may justify the imperial worship. To begin with, Julius Caesar, who was the first to be granted the numerous divine honours and to be apotheosised, was able to claim his divine descent from Aeneas, the son of Venus, although ancestral divinity was not peculiar to the emperors but was widely believed for the kings and great men in general both in Greece and Rome. Secondly, there was a stream of philosophical thinking which claimed that all the major gods were once human, called 'Euhemerism', based on the Greek account on the gods' origin written by Euhemerus and translated into Latin by Ennius. In addition to this philosophical concept, there existed a popular mystic belief among the Romans that the best men were promised an immortality after death, which reduced the distance between divine and mortals significantly and which made all men 'at least potentially divine'. Weinstock, p.9 Beard, North and Price, p.4 Taylor, p.1 Thirdly, the Romans traditionally worshipped 'the divine in man' under two aspects: the Genius which was perceived as a guardian spirit of the paterfamiliae, and the Lar or two Lares which was probably interpreted as some sort of spirits of dead ancestors. On which divines to worship at the level of the house cult in each household other than these two deities, the paterfamiliae had the authority to choose. In this respect, we may able to argue that the imperial cult was a phenomenon that came out from a natural discourse, in which the members of the state at large worshipped the divinity of its head, the paterpatriae, and whatever deities he decided to incorporate into his community, as opposed to that the members of the individual household worshipped the Genius of the paterfamilae. Taylor, p.9 Scheid, p.48 So far we have been looking at the supporting evidences for the imperial cult as a religious institution, but there were of course several factors which talk against the statement and tempt us to assess the cult as rather more political. The political advantage for the rulers to become a god to legitimise and strengthen their regime had been recognised long before the imperial cult by Aristotle, partially under whose advice and partially under his father's influence Alexander the Great successfully encouraged the establishment of his own cult among his subjects. Fundamentally political motivation for instituting the imperial cult may, moreover, not only come from the ruling side wishing to gain some sort of political control by imposing, licensing and manipulating the cult, which can often be observed particularly in Western provinces of the empire, but also from the ruled side who voluntarily adopt the form of cult to flatter to their rulers in order to gain diplomatic advantages, which is said to be essentially a phenomenon of the Eastern Greek cities. 284a: 'But if there is one man.of superlative virtue.we may reasonably regard such a one as a god among men - which shows, clearly, that legislation too must apply only to equals in birth and capacity.' Hopkins, p.09 There is also linguistic evidence which may suggest the hesitation of the Romans and its subjects in placing the imperial cult in exactly the same importance and religious significance as their traditional cults. In Latin the term divus, as distinguished from the traditional gods deus, was used as official terminology from Julius Caesar onwards to refer to the deceased emperors and members of their family. In the Greek speaking East, sacrifices were made for the living emperor on many occasions but predominantly they were described as the sacrifices 'on behalf' of the emperor, rather than 'to' the emperor. These linguistic ambiguities might exemplify the tendency of the Romans and their subjects to avoid elevating the imperial cult as a religious institution so high as to displace their traditional pagan deities. Price:984a, p.3 Price:980, p.2 Price: 984b, p.47 But now we have to go back to our first question posed in the first section: are we right in presupposing that 'religious' is an antonym of 'political'? In other words, is it really impossible for the imperial cult to be religious as well as political? In the rest of my essay, I shall briefly investigate the pre-war Japanese imperial cult and its characteristics in order to reach a conclusion if religion and politics are really incompatible with each other. Unfortunately we do not have enough space here to conduct a detailed examination on how the Japanese imperial cult came into existence, but one thing noteworthy here is the fact that it was started by elites, not only with a purely political insight but actually with a high level of mental involvement in the ideology as well. By the time Japan placed itself in the middle of the warfare in the beginning of the 0 th century the cult had already acquired highly political characters and was reduced to a mere political tool for the authorities to ensure an absolute loyalty from their subjects, however, at least it was initially promoted by the elites who actively came to a conclusion that the notion of the divine emperor is credible and trustworthy after much logical thinking and academic research on the topic. For example, Yoshida Shoin, a Japanese philosopher in the 9 th century, first studied the Shintyoku, a mythical statement by the most influential of the Japanese local gods proclaiming that the imperial family is his descendant, as a mere political ideology which was used to rule the people. After the long-time study of the concept and Japanese history, however, he changed his opinion totally and came to believe this as a religious ideology, and began to proclaim that Japan should overthrow the form of government of that time and reconstruct the central government as emperor-oriented. For all the Japanese names which come up in this essay was written in the Japanese style, that is, the surname comes before the fist name. Kirihara After the old government had collapsed and those who strongly believed that the divine emperor should gain the supreme political authority over the country occupied the high positions within the new government, the imperial cult emerged and was established through highly political means such as a constitution and educational doctrine. The former Japanese constitution, which was enforced in 890, clearly indicated that Japan should be ruled by the emperor and his direct descendants (Chapter1, Article1), who is holy and should not be violated (Chapter1 Article3). In a year prior to this, the Imperial Rescript on Education was also promulgated under the name of the emperor, which stated that the Japanese citizens were obliged to devote themselves to helping the emperor who rules the country according to the divine will, particularly in the time of crisis. Nevertheless this extremely manipulative and therefore political aspect of the imperial cult coincided with, interestingly enough, the passionate belief in the emperor's true divinity held by those who initiated these utilisation of political means. The record shows that Inoue Kowashi, one of the people who contributed in the production of a draft for both the constitution and the educational edict, chose every single word with an extreme caution because he acknowledged that any mistake or contradiction would be attributed to the emperor himself as dishonour, which would be an irredeemable sin. Tamura 'Dainihon Teikoku Kenpou (The Constitution of Imperial Japan)' Tamura 'Kyoiku ni kannsuru Tyokugo (The Imperial Rescript on Education)' Ito In spite of this forceful and premeditated imposition of the cult on the Japanese citizens, or maybe rather because of this, the cult was quickly spread out all over Japan and accepted by its inhabitants with great enthusiasm. This may seem slightly strange that highly political stratagems could stir up a religious sensation among the people. In reality, however, if one wishes to establish the cult as largely a political institution so as to manipulate and ensure stable loyalty of his subjects, it is not enough just to force reluctant people to participate in the cult unwillingly but you have to derive the active involvement and truthful respect towards the cult out of your subjects. Another important factor, other than political propagandas and cruel oppression of opponents of the cult, which might have helped the Japanese people to absolve the cult into their everyday life, is the fact that this belief in the emperor's divinity could provide a means of self-respect with the worshippers. As we can see in Ito Hirobumi's Commentaries to the Japanese former constitution of which he himself was responsible for overall editing, he declared that 'The Sacred Throne was established at the time when the heaven and the earth became separate' as a comment to the position of the emperor. This statement clearly shows that the emperor's divinity is not only the matter of the Japanese nation, but it is expanded to the creation of the world as a whole. It may be argued, from this notion, that divinity of the emperor not only elevated the emperor himself high, but also encouraged his subjects to regard themselves as a chosen nation, directly reigned over by the lord of lords. Colegrove, p.44 Whatever the crucial factors were, the imperial cult successfully took firm root in Japanese society. Hence the people's truly painful reaction mentioned at the beginning of this essay, when the end of the cult was officially announced under the name of the emperor. At the same time, however, nobody would totally deny it, I suppose, that the Japanese imperial cult was in many respects highly political. In this sense we may be able to conclude that to ask whether a form of state cult is essentially political or religious is misleading, since politics and religion are not always inversely proportional to each other: they can coexist side by side, and thus a cult can be both largely political and religious simultaneously. The attempt to investigate the character of a cult under the clear-cut categories of authentically political and genuinely religious entities is, therefore, just like trying to navigate a foreign city using a map of the world. Unless we switch the map with an appropriate road map, that is, we choose the right criteria, we would never get to our destination of assessing the nature of the imperial cult accurately.""","""Japanese Imperial Cult: Religion and Politics""","2513","""The Japanese Imperial Cult stands at the intersection of religion and politics, embodying a unique blend of spiritual beliefs and state ideology that has shaped Japan's history and culture for centuries. Rooted in the reverence for the Emperor as a divine figure, the Imperial Cult has played a pivotal role in shaping Japan's national identity and political landscape.  Dating back to ancient times, the concept of the Emperor as a symbol of divine ancestry and authority has been deeply ingrained in Japanese society. The Imperial family traces its lineage back to the mythical first Emperor, Jimmu, who is believed to be a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, the most important deity in Shintoism. This divine lineage forms the basis of the Emperor's status as a sacred and unifying figure in Japanese culture.  Shintoism, Japan's indigenous religion, has been closely intertwined with the Imperial Cult, reinforcing the belief in the Emperor's divine nature. Shinto rituals and ceremonies are often conducted to honor the Imperial family and invoke blessings for the nation. One of the most significant events in the Imperial calendar is the enthronement ceremony, where the new Emperor ascends to the Chrysanthemum Throne in a ritual that combines ancient traditions with modern protocols.  Historically, the Imperial Cult has been utilized as a tool to legitimize the authority of the Emperor and unify the Japanese people under a sense of national identity. During periods of political instability or foreign influence, the Imperial family served as a symbol of continuity and tradition, providing a sense of stability and cohesion to the nation. The Emperor's role as a symbolic figurehead was enshrined in the Meiji Constitution of 1889, which established the Emperor as the """"symbol of the state and of the unity of the people.""""  The Imperial Cult reached its zenith during the Meiji era (1868-1912) when Japan underwent rapid modernization and industrialization. Emperor Meiji, known as the """"Enlightened Ruler,"""" played a pivotal role in transforming Japan from a feudal society into a modern nation-state. The cult of Emperor Meiji, known as Meiji Tennōism, promoted loyalty and devotion to the Emperor as a unifying force for the nation's modernization efforts.  However, the Imperial Cult also became a tool for Japanese expansionism and militarism in the early 20th century. During World War II, the Emperor was elevated to a near-deity status by the government and military propaganda machine, portraying him as a divine figure guiding Japan's imperial ambitions. The concept of Imperial sovereignty was used to justify Japan's aggressive actions in Asia and the Pacific, leading to atrocities committed in the name of the Emperor.  Following Japan's defeat in 1945, the Imperial system underwent significant changes under the Allied occupation. Emperor Hirohito renounced his divine status in the famous Imperial Rescript on the Termination of the War, acknowledging his humanity and the need for Japan to embrace democracy and peace. The post-war Constitution of Japan, known as the """"Peace Constitution,"""" stripped the Emperor of his political power and established Japan as a pacifist nation.  Today, the Imperial family continues to maintain a symbolic role in Japanese society, embodying traditions and ceremonial functions that are deeply rooted in the country's cultural heritage. Emperor Naruhito, who ascended to the throne in 2019, emphasizes the importance of compassion and understanding in his public engagements, symbolizing a modern and approachable image of the Imperial family.  While the Imperial Cult remains a fundamental aspect of Japan's cultural identity, its significance in contemporary politics is largely ceremonial. The Emperor's role is to promote unity and harmony within Japan and to engage in diplomatic activities to enhance Japan's international relations. The Japanese people hold deep respect for the Imperial family, viewing them as cultural icons rather than political leaders.  In conclusion, the Japanese Imperial Cult represents a complex interplay between religion and politics, tradition and modernity, that has shaped Japan's history and national consciousness. Rooted in the reverence for the Emperor as a divine figure, the Imperial Cult has evolved over time to reflect the changing dynamics of Japanese society. While its importance in politics has diminished, the Imperial family continues to symbolize Japan's rich cultural heritage and traditions, ensuring the legacy of the Imperial institution endures in the hearts of the Japanese people.""","866"
"265","""The senses sight, smell, touch and hearing provide us as humans with the means to detect a diverse set of external signals with great sensitivity and specificity giving us a perception of external environment allowing us to alter of perform, informed decisions based upon that. The cell signalling mechanisms of the senses, with regards to their activation, amplification and termination will be discussed before finally comparing and contrasting the different mechanisms. The neurobiology of the senses is out of the scope of this essay and so will not be discussed in any great depth.The senses touch, heat, light, sound and smell allow us to perceive different aspects of are external environment i.e. shape/texture, temperature, sound and odor respectively. These signals are then processed and combined with additional information in the central nervous system allowing us to perceive the situation and alter or perform, informed decisions based on that of the external environment. For example the ability to recognise an attractive pleasant smelling to be capable of picking the rose up without damaging -. R interacts with the bound heterotrimeric G protein causing the exchange of GDP for GTP by the alpha subunit of transducin. Upon this exchange of GDP for GTP, the alpha subunit dissociates from R and the y subunit of transducin dissociate from that of the alpha subunit. The GGTP stimulates cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase which hydrolyses cyclic GMP thus reducing the cytoplasmic concentration of cyclic GMP. This drop in concentration causes the closure of cation ion selective ion channels in the plasma membrane. The reduction in the influx of Na+ and Ca + results in the hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane, the decrease in cystolic Ca + concentration reduces the rate of release of the neurotransmitter: glutamate from the synaptic converts intracellular ATP to cyclic AMP which binds to the intracellular face of a cyclic nucleotide gated causing a conformational change favouring the open position. Na+ and Ca + flow through this open channel, thus depolarising the cell. An inactive OSN maintains a resting potential of approximately -5/8mV, if the membrane potential becomes 0mV less negative then the cell reaches a threshold and generates an action potential. Ca + ions play an important amplification mechanism, since they are capable of activating a Cl- Ca2+ dependent ion channel causing the efflux of acts to further depolarise the cell therefore adding to the excitatory response magnitude. AdaptationIn the presence of a sustained odour stimulus, adaptation occurs which explains the transient current response generated by the stimulated neuron. Two forms of adaptation in olfactory neurons have been identified involving Ca + and cAMP. During sustained depolarisation of a neuron there is a transient rise in Ca + ions which acts on the open CNG cause a conformational change which decreases its sensitivity to cAMP. Therefore requiring a greater concentration of cAMP, to be generated to elicit the opening of the CNG channel. This is important for it allows the cells to be sensitive to small changes in concentration therefore allowing greater sensitivity over a wide range of concentrations. The high transient Ca + concentration activates the kinase PKA. PKA can phosphorlate the receptor sending them into their desensitized state directly or by phospharylating and therefore activating putative olfactory receptor opens voltage gated calcium channels. The resultant Ca + influx mediates the release of the excitatory afferent transmitter, glutamate and/or another compound that can excite glutamate receptors on the primary afferent neurons. AdaptationHair cells respond to sustained stimuli by adapting restoring its sensitivity to threshold deflections, by setting a resting tension in that of the gating springs. This returns the transduction channel open probability to that of %. It has been found that two distinct Ca + dependent forms of adaptation operate simultaneously in hair cells. One of which occurs on a millisecond to sub-millisecond timescale involving the transduction channels directly while the other requires ten to hundreds of milliseconds for completion and is believed to involve an adaptation motor. The transduction channels contains one or more Ca + binding sites on its cytoplasmic surface, when occupied by Ca + ions it induces a molecular rearrangement which favours reclosure of the channel. The high intracellular concentration of Ca + activates calcium dependent K+ channels causing an efflux of potassium ions.0 The efflux of the K+ ions hyperpolarises the cell and so closes the voltage gated Ca2+ and the Ca2+ intracellular concentration. Sense Touch and Heat. The molecular mechanism with which sensory neurons detect mechanical change or force, are still very poorly understood 3. However this does not prevent one from forming a general mechanotransduction model based on known facts and that of other similar mechanisms. As with other sensory mechanism speed and sensitivity in the mechanosensory cells are vital. Thus any proposed mechanism is unlikely to involve that of a second messenger cascade but rather the direct effect of mechanical force on that of transduction channels. These channels are likely to detect a deflection of an external structure i.e. skin relative to an internal structure such as the cytoskeleton These transduction channels are a source of stimuli amplification since they allow the rapid entry of a large number of ions e.g. Na+ Ca + and it is thought likely to generate a Na+ dependent action potential. TRPV4 has been proposed as a suitable channel involved in mechanosensation for it is known to be located in the keratinocyte and that mice deficient of TRPV4 were found to be insensitive to mechanosensation8. Thermo-sensorsHumans can sense a wide range of temperatures from that of cold to heat, through the interaction of the external environment with that of the skin. Temperature sensitive transient receptor potential channels have been identified as the possible ion channels involved in heat sensing. TRPV1 not only be activated by that of capsaicin but is also by temperatures greater than 3C, three other TRPV channels: TRPV2, TRPV3 and TPRV4 have also been identified as heat thermosensors 4. Two other TRP channels: TRPA1 and TRPM8 have been found to be activated by cold stimuli, since both TRPA1 and TRPV2 sense temperatures at either end of the 'comfortable' temperature scale thus it is that they are involved in nociception 4. The locations of at least three of the thermosensors: TRPV1, TRPV3 and TRPV4 are expressed in skin keratinocytes, suggesting that they act in conjunction with sensory aid us to perceive our thermal environment 5/8. TRPV1 has been shown via single channel openings recording in excised membrane patches expressing it that heat directly gates the channel 4. For the other mentioned channels this has not of yet conclusively been determined that heat directly gates the channel however it is thought likely 4. Upon activation by heat TRPV ion channels open allowing the influx that of direct photoreceptor cells: rod cells exhibit cell hyperpolarisation when activated by a photon, while negative hair displacement in hearing also causes hyperpolarisation it does not lead to a message being transmitted to the brain. However the hyperpolarisation in a rod cell reduces the rate of transmitter release, which acts to excite the postsynaptic retinal neurons, since the transmitter acts to inhibit them (Figure ). While in olfaction, hearing, touch and pressure upon excitement they undergo depolarisation and the generation of an action potential. Concluding RemarksOlfaction and Phototransduction involve TM receptors bound to G-proteins in specialised cells: olfactory sensory neuron, rod cells which undergo signal transduction cascades analogous to each other. Hearing and thermo/pressure sensing are examples of direct mechanotransduction. Hearing is known to take place in the specialised cell called hair cells however the cells which are responsible for thermo/pressure sensing remain elusive along with a detailed understanding of their cell signalling mechanisms. Direct mechanotransduction mechanisms display greater speed in signal transduction as opposed to that of G-protein linked cascades; however they forfeit the amplification that G-protein cascades bring. Ca + has been identified as an important ion involved in the process of adaptation in all the cell signalling mechanisms discussed. The importance of adaptation can not be stressed enough for it gives us as humans such great sensitivity in our senses.""","""Cell Signaling in Sensory Perception""","1701","""Cell signaling in sensory perception is a fascinating process that underpins how we perceive the world around us. Our senses – such as sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch – rely on intricate mechanisms involving various cells that communicate with each other through signaling pathways. Understanding how these signals are transmitted and processed by the nervous system is crucial for comprehending sensory perception. Let's delve into the world of cell signaling in sensory perception to unravel the mysteries of how we experience the world.  At the core of sensory perception lies the concept of sensory transduction, where external stimuli such as light, sound, chemicals, or temperature are converted into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. This transformation of physical stimuli into neural signals occurs through specialized sensory receptors located in sensory organs like the eyes, ears, tongue, nose, and skin. These receptors are often sensory neurons or specialized cells that initiate the process of signal transduction.  The process of signal transduction begins when a specific sensory receptor detects a stimulus. For instance, in vision, photoreceptor cells in the retina detect light through the activation of light-sensitive pigments. Upon stimulation, these receptors generate electrical signals that are then transmitted to adjacent sensory neurons. This initial step triggers a cascade of events that ultimately leads to the generation of action potentials, which are the language of communication in the nervous system.  Cell signaling in sensory perception involves complex signaling cascades that relay information from the sensory receptors to the brain for interpretation. These signaling pathways are often mediated by neurotransmitters, second messengers, and various proteins that play key roles in transmitting and modulating signals. For example, in the olfactory system responsible for sense of smell, odorant molecules bind to receptors on olfactory sensory neurons, initiating a signaling cascade that results in the generation of action potentials.  One essential concept in cell signaling is the idea of signal amplification. Sensory stimuli are typically weak, but through signal amplification processes, the initial stimulus can generate robust signals that can be reliably transmitted to the brain. This amplification can occur at various stages of the signaling pathway, ensuring that even faint sensory stimuli can be detected and accurately interpreted by the nervous system.  Furthermore, the process of sensory adaptation plays a crucial role in sensory perception. Sensory adaptation refers to the phenomenon where sensory receptors decrease their response to constant or repetitive stimuli over time. This adaptive mechanism allows organisms to focus on the changing aspects of their environment while filtering out constant stimuli. For instance, when first entering a room with a strong smell, the initial intensity may decrease as the olfactory receptors adapt to the scent.  In addition to signal transduction and amplification, sensory perception also involves the integration of sensory information in the brain. Different sensory modalities, such as vision, hearing, and touch, are processed in specialized regions of the brain before being integrated into a coherent perception of the environment. This integration is essential for constructing a multisensory representation of the world around us.  Cell signaling in sensory perception is not limited to the perception of external stimuli but also extends to intercellular communication within sensory organs. For example, in the inner ear, sensory hair cells communicate with auditory neurons through intricate signaling mechanisms that enable the transmission of sound signals to the brain. This intercellular communication is essential for the proper functioning of sensory systems.  Moreover, cell signaling in sensory perception is remarkably precise and efficient. The speed at which sensory signals are transmitted and processed is crucial for our ability to react to stimuli in real time. For instance, in the somatosensory system responsible for touch and proprioception, the transmission of signals from sensory receptors to the brain occurs rapidly to facilitate rapid responses to external stimuli.  Overall, cell signaling in sensory perception is a sophisticated and intricate process that allows us to experience the richness of the world around us. From the detection of external stimuli to the interpretation of sensory information in the brain, cell signaling plays a pivotal role in shaping our perception of reality. By unraveling the mechanisms of cell signaling in sensory perception, we gain a deeper appreciation for how our senses enable us to interact with and navigate the world.""","820"
"6170","""PurposeThe purpose of this report is to evaluate the usability of the current way-finding system for Armstrong Siddeley building and based on this evaluation prepare the prototype of the redesign. OverviewThe way-finding systems are designed in order to give people clear and appropriate directions in places they are unfamiliar with. The most important attribute of such system is its usability and satisfaction it gives to the user. It is crucial that the way can be found as quickly as possible. In case of our prototype the target time for locating the person / room does not exceed minutes. The idea of introducing the way-finding system for Armstrong Siddeley building was to help the following people to find the way without help of can make user confused why some rooms are highlighted in blue. A smaller problem with the map is the lack of 'Back' button - navigation problem. Familiarity problem Severity MediumImpact User confusionOne more problem I found important in the current way-finding system concerns the way the e-mail addresses are presented e.g. r.bali. Only part of the email with the person name is shown whereas the server domain is not visible. It might cause problems for potential students and their relatives as they would not know that the domain is coventry.ac.uk. The best and easiest way to fix it is just add the domain name to the email address e.g. Task analysisThe way-finding system is supposed to assist the user in locating appropriate rooms or staff members. I have asked potential users what tasks they would expect the system to perform. Basing on the most frequent answers I decided to create five main by module - this option might be useful if we are trying to locate where a lecture is taking placeThe system should display a map of the floor with the searched room. Task - How to submit a coursework? This feature will be used by student's friends or relatives who come to submit the student's coursework. The system will show the way to Academic will also give information about the latest time allowed for submission. Task - MapsThis feature of the system will show the map of selected floor. It will be useful for potential students who are not searching for a particular room but only want to get familiar with the building. The legend for all maps will be also provided. Task - Staff ListThe system will also enable to list names of all staff members. This approach might be useful in case the user does not remember the exact name but would recall it when he sees it written. This feature is very easy and low cost to implement and very handy for the users at the same time. The prototype that I build will comprise all above named features and can be further developed in order to increase user satisfaction. In a final system all the maps should be interactive - when the user moves the mouse over a room, information concerning this room should be displayed e.g. whose office it is etc. PrototypeIn the process of developing the prototype I based on task analysis performed in previous section as the most important attribute of the system is meeting user requirements. I have also considered and tried to avoid all usability problems described in section. The system will be compliant with usability heuristics by Benyon, Turner & Turner. There is menu on the left hand side displaying the system features. This solution makes the system easy to navigate. When a user clicks on any of the links, the relevant page will be displayed in the main window. 'Home' button enables coming back to the main page. There is no need to place any 'back' buttons as the system is very simple and does not have nested sub pages - to go back user always can click on either appropriate link or 'Home' button. The main page of designed system is shown at Figure: On the main page I have placed the 'search' option. It is a general search which enables to search for any phrase within the way-finding system. 'Search for person' page is shown at Figure: 'Search for room' page is shown at Figure: 'How to submit coursework? ' page is shown at Figure: 'Maps' page is shown at Figure: To choose the floor the user needs to click on the floor link. The map of the chosen floor will then be displayed (see Figure ). The legend and floor links will still be available (so that the user does not have to memorize what the colour means etc.). In the future the user should also have option to print the map with the legend but this option will not be available at the first release as there is no printing device. 'Staff List' page is shown at Figure: Figure shows an example search result. We searched for a person, by name:'Hodder'. The system displays information concerning the searched person including his role, room number, phone number, email address and working hours. System also shows a map of the relevant floor with the route marked on it. It also gives the directions in text form (useful in case of any higher floors as it is impossible to show on the map e.g. 'take a lift to rd floor'). SummaryThe proposed prototype seems to meet all user requirements. It is simple and therefore easy to use. It does not contain any irrelevant information which would make it less visible. All main features of the system have their links on the left hand side menu which is available all the time. Proposed solution is compliant to the set of heuristics.""","""Way-finding system usability evaluation""","1087","""Way-finding systems play a crucial role in helping people navigate through complex environments such as airports, hospitals, museums, and shopping malls. These systems provide guidance through a combination of signage, maps, digital displays, and other tools to assist users in reaching their destinations efficiently. Evaluating the usability of way-finding systems is essential to ensure that they effectively serve their purpose and meet the needs of the users. In this article, we will explore the process of conducting a usability evaluation for way-finding systems, including key considerations, methods, and best practices.  When evaluating the usability of a way-finding system, it is important to consider the needs and preferences of the intended users. Understanding the demographics, characteristics, and behaviors of the target audience is crucial in designing a system that caters to their specific requirements. Factors such as age, language proficiency, cultural background, and physical abilities should be taken into account to ensure that the system is inclusive and accessible to all users.  One of the first steps in evaluating the usability of a way-finding system is to define clear objectives and success criteria. This involves outlining what the system is expected to achieve, such as providing accurate directions, reducing navigation time, or enhancing user satisfaction. Establishing measurable goals allows evaluators to assess the effectiveness of the system and identify areas for improvement.  Usability testing is a commonly used method to evaluate the effectiveness of a way-finding system. This involves observing users as they interact with the system to complete specific tasks, such as finding a gate at an airport or locating a restroom in a hospital. By observing users in real-time, evaluators can identify usability issues, such as confusing signage, unclear directions, or inefficient layouts, that may impact the user experience.  In addition to usability testing, feedback surveys and interviews can provide valuable insights into the user experience. Gathering feedback from users about their satisfaction, preferences, and challenges encountered while using the system can help identify areas for improvement. Feedback can be collected through various channels, such as online surveys, in-person interviews, or comment cards, to gather diverse perspectives from a wide range of users.  Another important aspect of evaluating the usability of a way-finding system is assessing its accessibility and inclusivity. Designing a system that is accessible to users with disabilities, such as visual impairments or mobility limitations, is essential to ensure equal access for all individuals. Evaluators should consider factors such as color contrast, font size, tactile elements, and audible cues to make the system more inclusive and user-friendly.  Furthermore, the consistency and clarity of the signage and information provided by the way-finding system are key factors in its usability. Clear and coherent signage that follows established conventions and standards helps users navigate the environment with ease. Evaluators should assess the readability of text, the visibility of signs, and the coherence of directions to ensure that the information provided is easily understood and followed by users.  Technology plays an increasingly important role in modern way-finding systems, with digital displays, interactive maps, and mobile applications becoming common tools for navigation. When evaluating the usability of technology-based systems, it is important to consider factors such as responsiveness, accuracy, and user-friendly interface design. Ensuring that the technology is intuitive and easy to use is essential for a positive user experience.  In conclusion, evaluating the usability of a way-finding system is essential to ensure that it effectively serves its purpose of guiding users through complex environments. By considering the needs of the users, defining clear objectives, using appropriate methods such as usability testing and feedback surveys, and ensuring accessibility and clarity in signage and information, evaluators can identify areas for improvement and create a more user-friendly system. Incorporating technology effectively and ensuring inclusivity are also important factors to consider when evaluating the usability of modern way-finding systems. By prioritizing usability in the design and evaluation process, organizations can enhance the user experience and make navigation more efficient and enjoyable for all users.""","784"
"61","""La Place is a piece of work, of biographical intent, targeting the narration of the life of the father of Annie Ernaux. The narrator wishes to depict a portrait of her father's life which is objective and does not suffer from bias or which becomes subjective or sentimental - a flaw she readily points out of accounts of similar intent: 'Pour rendre compte d'une vie soumise a la necessite, je n'ai pas le droit de prendre d'abord le partie de l'art, ni de chercher a faire quelque chose de 'passionnant', ou d''emouvant'. ' This piece, however, fails to be scientific and non-emotive throughout; it becomes instead one filled with auto-reflection and removed from the intended narrative into a meta-narrative. This is partly due to the fact that Ernaux transforms herself as the narration progresses and realises that she herself is split between two social classes. The fact that she fails to remain audit throughout is one of the key pessimistic views in the book, as she has failed this because of the class divisions. The themes of social conditioning and class divisions are, therefore, paramount throughout 'La Place' - the title itself hints at the importance of one's 'place' in society - and there are many examples in the text of alienation, guilt and schism to prove that the narrator's views on these issues are, on the whole, pessimistic. Ernaux, Annie., La Place, p.4 Western civilisation is one geared towards consumption under the aegis of capitalism and, therefore, in every similar society, a class structure will inevitably emerge. Social conditions and external forces - such as peer-pressure, create a certain social model or 'norm' to which one feels compelled to abide by. There are many examples of the pressure on people to follow these artificial criteria in 'La Place'. The father of the narrator is portrayed as desperate ensure that his daughter is educated into a higher social class, perhaps so she will never feel as uncomfortable in the company of the bourgeoisie as he often does. He becomes increasingly more distant from his daughter but wishes to ensure her elevation nonetheless: 'Il me conduisait de la maison a l'ecole sur son velo. ' The social conditions are so strong that the father actually, in this example, takes her daughter to a place which he knows will distance him further from his daughter. This is a pessimistic view. The idea of being educated into a higher sector of society, mirrors those of Bourdieu - a French sociologist who outlines 'linguitic and cultural capital as significant as economic capital'. This is mirrored in La Place: 'Tout ce qui touche au langage est dans mon souvenir motif de rancur et de chicanes douloureuses, bien plus que l'argent. ' Bordieu also expresses the difference between the 'classes dominantes / classes dominees' which Ernaux also outlines and shares a pessimistic view of. Ibid., p.12 Bourdieu, La Distinction, critique sociale du jugement Ernaux, Annie., La Place, p.4 Bourdieu, La Distinction, critique sociale du jugement Ernaux outlines further pessimism as regards to social conditioning and the concept of a class structure, by explaining that people who attempt to move from one sector to another become alienated. This indeed happens to the narrator herself; she, who has moved into the bourgeoisie, has a resulting split-personality. That is to say that she feels alienated from her family and her previous social class as well as herself. This is shown when she goes back to the cafe and reports to feel almost like an impostor. Another example of La Place being a pessimistic view of class divisions and social conditioning is the point that her father does not fit in and even feels embarrassed when speaking to, or in the company of, those from a higher social class. Because of the class divisions and language barriers which coincide with them, he can never be himself in certain groups and this is how a person's identity is partly lost. He is always compelled by 'La peur d'etre deplace, d'avoir honte. ' he feels always out of place and, because he has become a marchant, is afraid of making mistakes and being found out of being a paysan - 'devant les gens qui parlaient bien il se taisait,.toujours precaution.il detestait aussi les grandes phrases et les expressions nouvelles'. The pessimistic view put forward here is that the presence of a different class ensures that the father has always to be on his guard, he is separated from them and his daughter as he belongs to a different sphere of knowledge. The point of language further alienates her father as we discover that her mother is somewhat different; in that she is 'soucieuse de faire evoluee, qui osait experimenter, avec un rien d'incertitude, ce qu'elle venait d'entendre ou de lire' as opposed to him who 'se refusait a employer un vocabulaire qui n'etait pas le sien. ' He is, therefore, portrayed as being left completely isolated. Ernaux, Annie., La Place, p.9 Ibid., p.3 Ibid., p.3 Ibid., pp.3-4 The social conditions and the very fact that a class structure exists cause the narrator to feel guilty. She feels guilty when coming back to the cafe and also when she meets her former pupil who says to her she has failed. The narrator cannot even remember the woman and feels she has failed in some way. ''Le C.E.T., ca n'a pas marche.'. Mais j'avais oublie pourquoi elle avait ete envoye en C.E.T. ' The arrogance of the librarians is another pessimistic view concerning the class divisions; when the father asks for some books one of the librarians 'a choisi a notre place, Columba pour moi, un roman leger de Maupassant pour mon pere. ' These are both non-challenging pieces. The appearance of exclusivity evoked by the librarians of the educated, higher class is a negative one. Ibid., p.14 Ibid., p.12 Whilst everyone is trying desperately to fit in to a place where their identity is contradicted, people become isolated. This occurs in each generation in the book. It seems also, that the targeted ideal is actually never reached by anyone. However, there are some themes in the book which one could interpret as not pessimistic of social standing and class divisions. The father, although uneasy in certain situations, never suffers any real hardship so it could be argued that pessimism is too strong a word. The narrator is part of these class divisions and social conditions and helps to judge them, being a teacher. It is unlikely therefore that she would speak with total pessimism. Another example is that one could interpret the class divisions and indeed the social conditions as being the reason for people - such as the narrator - to become educated and want to better themselves. Although the reasons for not be entirely just or ideal, a population filled with such sorts - those who strive to be educated - can surely only be beneficial to a society. Therefore, in this situation such class divisions and social conditions can hardly be viewed as pessimistic. The narrator indeed speaks highly of her education throughout. In conclusion, therefore, although there are a small number of examples which could be interpreted as contradicting to this statement, due to the portrayal of guilt but mainly alienation and pressure, La Place is a pessimistic view of social conditions and class divisions.""","""Class divisions and social conditioning""","1572","""Class divisions and social conditioning are fundamental aspects of society that shape individuals' lives, opportunities, perspectives, and behaviors. These interconnected concepts influence how people perceive themselves and others, impacting their interactions, beliefs, and societal roles. Understanding the dynamics of class divisions and social conditioning is crucial for recognizing and addressing inequalities, fostering empathy, and building a more inclusive society.  Class divisions refer to the hierarchical stratification of society based on socioeconomic factors such as income, education, occupation, and wealth. This stratification creates different social classes, each with its own status, privileges, and opportunities. In most societies, there are typically three main classes: the upper class, the middle class, and the lower class. The upper class comprises the wealthiest and most privileged individuals, often characterized by inherited wealth, prestigious professions, and social influence. The middle class includes a broad range of professions, from white-collar workers to small-business owners, generally enjoying moderate income and stability. The lower class consists of individuals with limited resources, facing economic challenges and often lacking access to essential services and opportunities.  Social conditioning, on the other hand, refers to the process by which society shapes individuals' beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and identities through socialization, norms, institutions, and media. From a young age, individuals are exposed to various social influences that mold their understanding of the world and their place in it. Family, peers, education, religion, and the media all play significant roles in shaping people's perceptions and behaviors, reinforcing societal norms and values. Social conditioning can perpetuate stereotypes, biases, and inequalities, influencing how individuals perceive themselves and others based on factors like class, race, gender, and ability.  Class divisions and social conditioning are deeply intertwined, as social hierarchies and norms often perpetuate and reinforce inequalities based on socioeconomic status. Individuals from different social classes are socialized differently, leading to distinct worldviews, aspirations, and opportunities. For example, children from affluent families may have access to better education, healthcare, and resources, shaping their beliefs about success, meritocracy, and social mobility. In contrast, children from disadvantaged backgrounds may face systemic barriers that limit their access to quality education, job opportunities, and upward mobility, reinforcing cycles of poverty and inequality.  Moreover, social conditioning can create barriers to empathy and understanding between people from different class backgrounds. Stereotypes, prejudices, and stigmas associated with certain social classes can lead to discrimination, judgment, and social exclusion. Individuals may internalize these societal norms and biases, influencing their attitudes and behaviors towards others. For instance, negative stereotypes about the lower class as lazy or incompetent can impact how individuals from higher classes perceive and interact with them, perpetuating social divides and injustices.  To address class divisions and challenge social conditioning, individuals and society as a whole must engage in critical reflection, dialogue, and action. Recognizing one's own biases and privileges is essential in cultivating empathy and understanding towards others. By actively questioning societal norms and inequalities, individuals can contribute to creating a more equitable and inclusive society. Educational institutions, policymakers, and organizations also play a crucial role in promoting social awareness, diversity, and equal opportunities for all members of society.  Efforts to promote social mobility, reduce income inequality, and provide access to essential services are essential steps towards addressing class divisions and breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty. Investing in education, job training programs, affordable housing, and healthcare can help level the playing field and create pathways for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to succeed. Moreover, initiatives that foster cross-class interactions, dialogue, and collaboration can help bridge divides, promote mutual understanding, and challenge stereotypes and prejudices.  In conclusion, class divisions and social conditioning are complex phenomena that shape individuals' identities, experiences, and opportunities in society. By understanding the interconnected nature of these concepts and their implications for social justice and equality, we can work towards building a more inclusive and compassionate society. Through empathy, education, advocacy, and solidarity across class lines, we can challenge entrenched inequalities, dismantle barriers to social mobility, and create a more just and equitable world for all.""","817"
"3130","""When modern medicine was established in the nineteenth century it was based upon the premise that illness was caused by diseases attacking the body. Health was believed to be the absence of disease. Health care was therefore based almost entirely upon the conceptualisation of health as a biological state of being. Society as a whole and the individual in particular were believed to have little or no influence over health, illness or disability. This placed the responsibility and control over health and illness within the medical profession. This view of health has since been described as the medical model. In the twentieth century sociologists and psychologists began to challenge the medical model of health. They suggested that health is influenced by society and the individual as well as biology. Sociology and psychology explained not only the effects of society and the individual on health but through scientific studies developed theories which explained the experience of health and the effects of illness, disability and service delivery on the individual. By examining how particular theories apply to practise I will demonstrate how sociology and psychology can help the health care professional to understand the effects of illness and service delivery on the individual. There are various different definitions of health, illness, disability and service delivery. For the purpose of this essay I will define health in terms of the Social model and use the definition provided by the World Health is that 'Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well being and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity' (WHO, 946). Therefore illness is the absence of either physical, mental or social well being. Throughout this essay I have used the example family I have illustrated in the appendix to support my arguments and to relate theory to practise. Whilst there are some clear distinctions between psychology and sociology: Sociologists aim is to '. understand the individuals place in the world, where they are, what they do and what their views are' (p1 Iphofen and Poland, 998); Whereas Psychologists study behaviour and the 'thoughts feelings and motivations underlying such behaviour' (The British Psychological Society, 005/8). There are also many similarities Sociology also looks at the individual's interpretation of their bodily psychology studies the individual within a social learned helplessness and can result in perceived uncontrollability. This explains situations where the individual feels that they have no power or control over their situation. The health care professional who is treating Alice would need to take this into account and help her to understand that it is within her control to feel better. Another way of understanding these concepts is through the Common Sense Model. This model hypothesises that individuals create mental representations of their illness based upon how they interpret information available to them. The way individuals experience illness depends on how it affects their life. Psychologists Hagger and Orbell explain how individuals view their illness e.g. that it make their life worse or stops them from doing what they want to do. Beliefs about the ability to control or cure an illness can also be explained by the common sense model. For example whether people believe that following medical advice will relieve them of symptoms. John does not understand that he has dementia so he does not believe that following medical advice will be of any benefit to him at all. also unsure that following medical advice will relieve her of her symptoms of depression this in part explains why she has not taken the doctors advice of medication and therapy. Studies suggest that individuals who believed their illness to be uncontrollable and chronic let it affect them more than those who saw it to be less chronic and not to have therapy. All the effects of illness on described have made Alice feel more depressed and less motivated to overcome the experience of depression. Maslow developed a theory to explain why individuals are motivated to do things. He rationalised that individuals are motivated to achieve things that meet psychological and physiological needs and that once they have achieved these things they can meet needs concerned with developing their potential. Alice has no physiological needs such as food, warmth or shelter; neither does she have safety needs. She is loved by members of her family so does not have those needs. However, she is lacking in self esteem and has a poor self concept. At present the sense of hopelessness Alice feels at achieving at having a better self concept and increased self esteem has meant she is not willing to try. Creek believes that the Therapist needs to take these things into account when working with a client who experiences a condition such as depression. Carter and Kulbuck have found that whilst theorists misuse theories of motivation to explain why individuals do or do not seek health, there is evidence to suggest that the individual's locus of control and self concept can affect motivation to seek health. It is evident that the concept of the sick role does not apply to all situations. For example when a person is chronically ill they cannot simply get better. In this situation how illness affects the individuals is better explained by the level of control or power they have over their condition. McNamara considers that 'The terminally ill person's experience.will be influenced largely by their ability to participate in decisions (p245/8 McNamara in Purdy and Banks, 001). In this case study Julie is participating in decisions about her condition. However despite Julie's involvement in her treatment and care she is still not in control of the debilitating effects of the condition. The experience of living with a chronic condition can further be explained in relation to inability to perform the practical matters of everyday life (Locker 004). Despite treatment Julie has lost her ability to participate in activities of daily living and needs to be cared for. Julie's self concept is also affected by her illness. Pain, nausea and fatigue can all alter self-concepts (McNamara, 001). Julie's body has been significantly changed by her illness, not only through surgery but by the effects of chemotherapy this has had a major impact upon her self concept. Sociology helps us to understand these effects on the individual by the development of social construction theories. Social construction theories offer explanations of what it means to be a person (McNamara, 001). Julie and her doctor have a relatively equal and client centred relationship. This has had a positive effect on her experience of illness. May et al have found that how doctors conceptualise chronic illness can affect how they respond to patients. Both sociologists and psychologists have explored doctor patient relationships in more detail and through these studies it has become apparent that there is not always an equal distribution of power in service delivery. The individual cannot demand attention, time or understanding from the doctor. In fact medical knowledge can be seen as a source of power in itself. Byrne and Long have found that some doctors practise seems to be based upon the idea that the doctor is the expert. At the other end of the continuum doctors base their consultations on a more patient centred approach which is focused more on listening and responding to individual needs. Stimson and Webb have found that both patients plan what to say to the doctor so that he takes notice. Morgan believes that the individual is unlikely to disclose how they feel about the medical advice they have been given if they do not feel the doctor will listen or act upon it. The effect of this may be that individuals do not follow medical advice and without informing their doctor that they are not. If the GP is to find out what Melvin believes about his high blood pressure and whether or not he is going to take on advice then he will need to allow the consultation to be client centred. By doing this he will allow Melvin to disclose information to him rather than the relationship being only one way. If an individual's experience of service delivery is not positive they may develop a belief that the health care professional cannot help them. The effect this may have on the individual is that they do not overcome being ill. Classical conditioning theory can describe individual's responses to of service delivery. Classical conditioning theory was first introduced by Ivan Pavlov to describe associative learning (Walker et Al, 004). For example if you have had a bad experience in hospital you will learn to associate negative feelings with hospitals. This can lead to avoiding being diagnosed, ignoring the problem or acting inappropriately. (Walker et Al, 004). Freda does not want to go into a nursing home because she feels that it is like a hospital. Freda has developed a fear of hospitals because she has had a bad experience when she first went into hospital after she experienced her stroke. This fear has been learnt by associating hospitals with bad feelings; it is therefore an example of classical conditioning. If the health care professional did not understand Freda's fear then they would not be unable to understand why Freda was afraid of going into hospital. The effects of service delivery on the individual here can be explained by understanding that Freda has had negative experience of service delivery and therefore does not which to repeat it. Finally it is important to consider how culture influences the effects of illness on the individual's within the case study. Sociology in particular looks at culture. Scrambler believes that how individuals interpret and experience the effects of illness can depend upon their culture. In the case study Rosa is of Italian descent and is a Roman catholic family life are very important to her and she would like her family to look after Freda following her stroke. If a care manager were to intervene and organise care without taking this cultural belief into account then the care set up may not be appreciated and may in fact be seen as an insult to the family by implying that they cannot cope. The effect of this service delivery could mean that the family will no longer trust a care manager to do what is right by them. In fact in this example family Melvin is arranging for Freda to go into residential care, Rosa does not mind this as it has been discussed and is being arranged by the family. However the care home itself needs consideration e.g. access to church on Sundays. All the theory's and examples included in this essay explain how sociology and psychology can help the healthcare professional to understand the effects of illness and service delivery on the individual within the context of their family, society or culture. The scientific studies of both sociologists and psychologists provide the health care professional with evidence to support their understanding of how the individual is affected by illness and service delivery. They do this by looking at what aspects of the individuals life is affected for example their role and explain why this occurs by theories such as classical conditioning, social construction and common sense models of health and illness. Without consideration of these theories, interventions would be based purely upon the biological effects of illness on the individual. The influence of sociology and psychology have allowed the health care professional to work in a more client centred and holistic way by explaining the possible effects of illness on the individual. This is crucial if health care is to meet all the needs of the individual and not just the biological ones.""","""Health models and individual experience""","2176","""Health Models and Individual Experiences  Health models play a crucial role in shaping our understanding of health and well-being, providing frameworks for how we approach and prioritize our health. These models offer valuable insights into the complex interactions between various factors that influence our overall health. However, while health models offer a general perspective on health, it is equally essential to consider individual experiences that may not always fit neatly into these frameworks. This nuanced interplay between health models and individual experiences highlights the need for a holistic approach to health that acknowledges both the broader patterns and unique circumstances that impact each person's well-being.  One of the most well-known health models is the biopsychosocial model, which recognizes the interconnectedness of biological, psychological, and social factors in influencing health outcomes. According to this model, health is not solely determined by biological factors but is also shaped by psychological processes and social influences such as education, income, and relationships. By considering the interplay of these different dimensions, the biopsychosocial model provides a comprehensive understanding of health that goes beyond a purely biological perspective.  Another prominent health model is the social determinants of health framework, which emphasizes the impact of social and economic factors on health disparities. This model recognizes that factors such as income inequality, access to healthcare, and environmental conditions can significantly influence an individual's health outcomes. By focusing on addressing these social determinants of health, policymakers and healthcare providers can work towards reducing health inequities and improving population health.  In addition to these broader health models, there is also a growing recognition of the importance of individual experiences in shaping health outcomes. Each person's health journey is unique, influenced by personal beliefs, cultural background, past experiences, and access to resources. For example, two individuals with the same medical condition may have vastly different experiences based on factors such as their socioeconomic status, support networks, and healthcare access.  It is essential to consider the intersection of health models and individual experiences to provide personalized and culturally sensitive healthcare. While health models offer valuable guidelines for understanding health at a population level, they may not always capture the complexity of individual experiences. Healthcare providers must be attuned to the unique needs and perspectives of each patient, taking into account not only their physical symptoms but also their emotional well-being, social circumstances, and personal values.  Moreover, individuals themselves play a significant role in shaping their health outcomes through lifestyle choices, self-care practices, and coping strategies. Personal agency and empowerment are essential components of promoting health and well-being, as individuals are best positioned to make decisions that align with their values and goals. By recognizing the importance of individual experiences and empowering patients to take an active role in their health, healthcare providers can foster a sense of ownership and accountability in managing health conditions.  Furthermore, the concept of patient-centered care emphasizes the importance of tailoring healthcare services to meet the specific needs and preferences of each individual. By involving patients in decision-making processes, respecting their autonomy, and actively listening to their concerns, healthcare providers can establish trust and collaboration that are essential for improving health outcomes. Patient-centered care recognizes that individuals are experts in their own experiences and encourages a partnership approach between healthcare providers and patients.  Ultimately, the integration of health models and individual experiences is essential for promoting holistic and patient-centered care. By combining the insights from broader health frameworks with a deep understanding of each person's unique circumstances, healthcare providers can deliver more effective and compassionate care. This approach not only addresses the complexity of health but also honors the diversity of human experiences and fosters a sense of dignity and respect in healthcare interactions.  In conclusion, health models provide valuable frameworks for understanding the multifaceted nature of health, while individual experiences offer unique insights into the personalized aspects of health and well-being. By integrating these perspectives, healthcare providers can deliver more comprehensive and patient-centered care that addresses both the commonalities and nuances of health. Recognizing the interplay between health models and individual experiences is crucial for advancing healthcare practices that promote equity, empathy, and meaningful engagement with patients.""","802"
"214","""The so called 'permissive revolution' has become a metaphor for contemporary social conflict. Ushered in during the 960s, the term permissiveness can be explained in two ways; it can be seen as a political change in that particular legislative movements were passed, and also in a sociologically way in that there was a wider set of changes, culturally, economically and in social seen to be the biggest event to liberate women from their designated roles as housewife and mother. It allowed women to have sexual intercourse without concern about unintended consequences. As Grant illustrates, 'the pill was the first reliable, effective contraceptive method over which women had complete control, putting the power of reproduction back into their own domain' (Grant, 994, p61). On the other hand, women lost the freedom to use pregnancy as an excuse to refuse to have sex and could feel the pressures to have coital sex (Hall, 000, p183). It can thus be seen by feminists that the sexual revolution was by definition a male orientated one which subordinated women more tightly to the heterosexist norm (Weeks, 985/8, p19). Alvarez saw the pill as beneficial, leading to what he saw as an altogether positive era; yet for feminists, it was a different story altogether; contraception, as illustrated above, has never been so diverse.. Alexander Goehr viewed the 95/80s as a period of great hope. There was an 'explosion of cultural activity'. However, despite such an optimistic view, he questions whether there were too many revolutionaries that would eventually knock everything down, only to be remade again. What he saw as new ideas were being embraced only by the small minority and not by the larger majority.' The assumption was that the world had changed, but it hadn't. What is interesting about this view on the 960s is summed up in the last sentence of his statement. Goehr describes how the 960s gave the impression of a start to a revolution; however, in reality, it appeared to mark an end to a progressive kind of thought.. Vanessa Redgrave saw the 960s as a period far from liberating. She states how Joe Orton was sent to prison for being homosexual and how Lord Chamberlain censored playwrights and productions. The Sexual Offences Act-967 decriminalised homosexual activity between consenting adults in private. This was initially seen as liberating and a step forward in society. However, although this was a remarkable breakthrough, the age of consent still differed from that of those involved in heterosexual relationships. As Vanessa Redgrave states, the 960s may have had legal changes, but was an era far from liberating. It is claimed that this reform led to a revolution in attitudes; the legal harassment was removed, yet the law did not alter the national attitudes and stigma towards sexual deviants; it merely altered the framework within which the law operated; in reality, 'the Sexual Offences Act of 967 did nothing to eliminate the hard core of bigotry and hatred' (Davenport-Hines, 990, p328). It is evident that all of the reforms of the late 95/80s and 960s marked a retreat from the social controls imposed in the Victorian era. Yet on reflection of both the article and further literature, it appears that the sexual revolution was like a rose with thorns (Ferris 993, p186). In some ways, there was a distinct move to liberation and progression. In reality however, such progression was not without drawbacks. What appeared to be radical legislative reforms all encased a contradictory nature. As Weeks illustrates, there were two key points to the problems of such reforms that were passed in the 960s. Firstly, each reform was argued for on its own merits, as support was needed form the government for each reform, the chief concern was to obtain a parliamentary majority vote. Thus, nothing too radical would ever be proposed in fear of rejection. Secondly, there was a distinct limited nature of reform. The homosexual law reform did not legalise homosexuality as such, it narrowly decriminalised certain aspects of male adult behaviour in private (Weeks, 981, p267). There were evident changes in the law, yet did these translate to liberalisation? What is evident from the above article is that the sexual revolution has meant different things for different people. For some people, it was an era of great optimism and liberation, yet for others, it just subordinated women further and exploited the consumerism market. As Abbie Hoffman states, 'revolution is not something fixed in ideology, nor is it something fashioned to a particular decade. It is a perpetual process embedded in the human spirit'. (Abbie Hoffman. Date unknown). Perhaps to fully understand this, and to realise that liberation could just be on an individual level, is indeed the greatest revolution of all.""","""Sexual revolution and women's liberation""","993","""The Sexual Revolution and Women's Liberation movements of the 1960s and 1970s were pivotal moments in history that reshaped societal norms and attitudes towards gender, sexuality, and personal autonomy. These movements brought about significant changes in how women were perceived, treated, and empowered within society, paving the way for greater gender equality and individual freedom.  The Sexual Revolution challenged traditional beliefs and taboos surrounding sexuality, advocating for greater sexual freedom, reproductive rights, and the acceptance of diverse sexual orientations. It aimed to dismantle the restrictive norms that governed sexual expression, advocating for a more open and liberal attitude towards relationships and individual choices. This era saw the widespread acceptance and use of contraceptives such as the birth control pill, which revolutionized women's ability to control their reproductive health and make informed choices about family planning.  Women's Liberation, on the other hand, focused specifically on dismantling the systemic oppression and gender inequalities that women faced in various aspects of their lives. It sought to address issues such as unequal pay, limited opportunities for career advancement, and societal expectations that confined women to traditional roles as homemakers and caregivers. Women's Liberation activists called for gender equality in the workplace, education, and all spheres of life, advocating for equal rights, opportunities, and representation.  One of the key aspects of the Sexual Revolution and Women's Liberation movements was the emphasis on individual agency and autonomy. Women were no longer content to be passive recipients of societal expectations but rather sought to assert their independence, make decisions about their bodies and sexuality, and challenge patriarchal structures that limited their potential. These movements encouraged women to embrace their own desires, goals, and aspirations, pushing back against the idea that women should conform to narrow societal standards.  The impact of these movements was profound and far-reaching. The Sexual Revolution and Women's Liberation paved the way for significant legal and social changes that improved the status of women in society. For example, the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision in 1973 legalized abortion in the United States, giving women the right to make choices about their own bodies. Additionally, laws were enacted to combat gender discrimination in the workplace and educational institutions, providing women with greater opportunities for advancement and equality.  The Sexual Revolution and Women's Liberation movements also sparked important conversations about consent, sexual violence, and the importance of affirmative consent in sexual relationships. These movements highlighted the need for respect, communication, and mutual understanding in intimate relationships, challenging notions of entitlement and power imbalances that had previously been normalized.  While the Sexual Revolution and Women's Liberation movements made significant strides in advancing women's rights and autonomy, they were not without challenges and criticisms. Some critics argued that these movements only benefited privileged, white women and failed to address the intersecting forms of discrimination faced by women of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other marginalized groups. Additionally, backlash from conservative and patriarchal forces sought to roll back the gains made by these movements, leading to ongoing debates about gender roles, sexuality, and reproductive rights.  Overall, the Sexual Revolution and Women's Liberation movements were instrumental in challenging societal norms, empowering women to assert their rights and autonomy, and paving the way for greater gender equality and individual freedom. These movements laid the foundation for ongoing activism and advocacy for women's rights, inspiring future generations to continue the fight for a more just and equitable society for all.""","669"
"6017","""There is no doubt that climate changes all over the world and this is not a scenario but the reality. The term 'climate change' sometimes is referring to all form of climatic inconsistency, but as Earth 's climate is not always the same, the term is best used to pinpoint significant change from one climatic condition to another. Although 'climate change' has become synonymous with 'global warming' scientists use the term in a wider sense including also natural changes in climate. (Global Change Research Centre National University of Taiwan) Comparing the last decade with previous it is easy to infer that climate has changed. In Europe, mean annual temperature has been increased by. C with the last the warmest. During the twentieth century, precipitation has also been increased over Northern Europe by 0-0% (The Europe Acacia project, 000). In the UK, the decade 985/8- 994 was warmer about. C than the average of 961- 990 period. As a result the warmer months and seasons experienced in the UK especially the last year is a strong evidence of climate change. Finally the global atmospheric CO concentration has been increased by % (985/8- 994). (Review of the Potential Effects of Climate Change in the United Kingdom, 996) According to scientists the UK climate will become warmer. It is estimated that by 05/80s, the annual temperature in the south east of the country will be C warmer than now. By the 080s temperatures may increase more than C. Generally south and east will be warmer than north and west. In addition, high temperatures during summer will become more frequent. By contrast, cold winters will become rare. It is also estimated that winters will become wetter and summer drier in the UK. By 080s winter precipitation will increase by 0%. By contrast, summer in central and South UK will be drier, with 8% less rainfall than now. In addition, sea level will increase in the UK about cm per decade especially in south and east. (UKCIP, 003) Climatic factors play an important role in the UK and have great contribution from year to year production. Changes that may occur, in terms of the intensity and distribution of precipitation combined with changes in CO and temperatures, will have great influence on the UK horticultural production. (Review of the Potential Effects of Climate Change in the United Kingdom, 996) There is no doubt that CO concentration has been increased and taking into account the fact that plants respond positively to an increase of it, the UK horticulture will benefit from this change. Increasing the level of C0, the level of photosynthesis increases and the rate of respiration decrease, resulting in greater productivity by crops especially C3 plants such as vegetables. (DEFRA, 003) For example, although temperatures have little impact on lettuce yield, it has been found that an increase in C0 from 5/80 ppm to 00 ppm enhances weight and as a result yield by 2% (Hadley et.al., 997). In cauliflower the increase of C0 has also a beneficial effect. Higher concentrations of C0 lead to an increase in total biomass and curd weight, which undoubtedly improves quality of the example of beneficial effect of C0 is carrot. Elevated C0 concentration increased root yield by 4% (Hadley et.al., 994). All these findings indicate that important benefits for the UK growers may happen in the future due to the increase of C0 concentration in the atmosphere. It is known that C0 leads to more efficient use of water. In higher concentrations plants use less water but more efficiently, being more able to resist water stress. In consequence, growers will have more water resistant plants and this is beneficial for horticultural production. (Smithsonian Environmental Research Centre, 999) Apart from cultivated plants, weeds are also influenced by C0. The rate of their photosynthesis is stimulated by higher levels of C0, being more antagonistic towards plants and more difficult to control them. As a result, the C0 influences crop- weed competitiveness, sometimes for the benefit of the crop and sometimes for the benefit of weeds. Such changes will affect their distribution in the UK and some weeds like perennials, which have rhizomes and storage organs, will become more difficult to be controlled by growers. (IPCC) Not only changes in C0 concentration but also changes in temperature will have great impact on the UK horticultural production. Escalated temperatures promote plant growth, but extremely high temperatures cause damage to the crops. It is estimated in the UK that rise in temperature will extent growing season available for the plants and will reduce the period required for maturation. This is beneficial for those areas of the UK where lower average temperatures prevail. An increase in temperature will expand the cultivation area of horticultural crops to north as well as to higher altitudes. By contrast, higher temperatures during summer will cause damage to crops and will increase the heat stress risk. (TDRI, 999) It is estimated that winters in the UK will become warmer and that climate change has great impact on horticultural crops. Plants such as apples, cherries and blackberries require a certain number of hours below a critical temperature to resume growth in the spring. In consequence, temperatures above average during winter will affect bud-dormancy and blossom during spring. In addition, taking into account that it is difficult to develop new varieties and rootstocks to respond to this rapid change of climate, the problem becomes more severe. As a result, warmer winters have negative effect and this is a concern for British Fruit Industry. (NC State University, 000) Apart from fruit crops, temperature affects salad crops such as lettuce. The minimum temperature for growth is between - 2 C and the maximum 7- 8 C, with the mean optimum temperature during maturity about 5/8 C. Although temperature has been found to have little effect on yield, it affects germination and growing season of lettuce. Apart from the fact that warmer temperatures promote germination, they also allow growing season to start earlier and simultaneously extent it. By contrast, higher temperatures during summer have a negative impact, increasing the possibility of bitterness, loose head and bolting. (DEFRA, 003) Cauliflower is another example of crop affected by temperature changes. First of all, it has three different stages of growth with different response to temperature; juvenility, vernalization and curd growth. Escalated temperatures reduce the period of juvenility and curd growth but delay curd initiation. Although increasing temperatures promote maturity of summer- cauliflower, they reduce maturity of autumn crops and as a result a better management of transplanting will be necessary so as to have continuity of production. Moreover, higher temperatures reduce the possibility of frost damage but maximize quality problems such as bract, leaf bract and curd looseness. (DEFRA, 003) Changes in temperature undoubtedly affect root crops such as onions and carrots. Soil temperatures between 0-0 C are the best for carrot growth. Taking into account that carrot growth is being promoted by an increase in temperature, crop production will also be increased. As frost damage will be reduced, the growing season will be extended resulting in earlier production especially under polythene. (DEFRA, 003) Not only carrots but also onions are affected by warmer climate. Temperatures between 3- 7 C are the best for fast growing of onion seedlings and higher temperatures boost vegetative growth before bulbing. In addition, 4 C promotes bulb diameter and increase the rate of bulb size. As a result, warmer temperatures will give earlier bulbing combined with faster bulb growth and maturity, but reduce yield as the duration of bulb growth is decreased. (DEFRA, 003) Finally, temperatures affect pests and weeds, which have great impact on horticultural production. As the climate changes and become warmer the problems for the UK growers will be multiplied. First of all, new pests are likely to be introduced to the UK, which are extremely harmful to other countries, due to warmer climate. Secondly, considering that winter temperature is crucial for the survival of many pests, increasing temperatures will promote their development and will reduce the time to reproductive -term adaptations for growers include changes in planting dates and cultivars and external inputs. As the climate in the UK will become warmer during winter and especially during summer, growers will be able to have earlier planting or sowing during spring. Earlier planting allows crops to reach maturity before high temperatures of summer take place. In addition, it allows growers to extend growing season and as a result to increase yield potential using long season varieties. Finally, deeper sowing will increase germination percentages due to higher temperatures. (The Europe Acacia project, 000) External inputs such as pesticides have to be taken seriously into account as the UK climate changes. The more warmer the climate becomes the more difficult for the growers is to control pests and diseases. The warmer climate will lead to higher incidence of these problems and simultaneously higher use of pesticides. In consequence, growers in order to optimise production and profitability have to adopt other systems, such as integrated pest management instead of empirical functions. ((The Europe Acacia project, 000) Long-term adaptations include the use of new and more resistant varieties and change of land use (The Europe Acacia project, 000). As in many regions the climate is likely to become warmer, growers will have to either change crop or change land. For example apple growers will have to move north so as chilling hours to be fulfilled. To sum up, as climate changes the response of crops also changes and as a result growers have to adapt as soon as possible. Another response to climate change for the UK growers is the use of new varieties (The Europe Acacia project, 000). They will have to abandon traditional varieties and choose those that are more resistant to heat, pests, diseases and require less chilling hours for bud emergence. There is no doubt that horticulture in the UK may be benefited from C0 and warmer temperatures in general. On the other hand, there are disadvantages as well. The impact of climate change varies among horticultural crops and cultivars. All these changes in climate are a challenge for the growers and in order to be successful they have to adapt as soon as possible and find alternative practices so as to take advantage of these.""","""Climate Change Impact on Horticulture""","2117","""Climate change is significantly impacting horticulture, the science and art of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers, and ornamental plants. As global temperatures rise, extreme weather events become more common, and precipitation patterns shift, horticulture faces a multitude of challenges. From altered growing seasons to increased pest and disease pressures, climate change has far-reaching implications for both commercial and home gardeners alike.  One of the most immediate impacts of climate change on horticulture is the change in temperature patterns. Warmer temperatures can lead to shifts in the timing of plant development, altering flowering times, fruit set, and overall growth cycles. This can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems, affecting pollinators, beneficial insects, and other wildlife that depend on specific flowering and fruiting schedules.  Moreover, rising temperatures can also increase the prevalence of heat stress in plants. Many horticultural crops have specific temperature requirements for optimal growth, and deviations from these norms can lead to reduced yields, poor fruit quality, and even crop failures. Heat stress can also make plants more susceptible to diseases and pests, further challenging growers.  Another significant consequence of climate change in horticulture is the disruption of water availability. Changes in precipitation patterns, including more frequent and intense droughts or floods, can impact soil moisture levels and irrigation needs. Drought conditions can lead to water shortages, affecting plant growth and survival, while excessive rainfall can cause waterlogging and nutrient leaching, altering soil fertility and microbial activity.  In addition to temperature and water-related impacts, climate change is also influencing pest and disease dynamics in horticulture. Warmer temperatures can extend the survival and reproductive periods of pests, such as insects and mites, allowing them to multiply rapidly and spread to new regions. Changes in humidity levels and rainfall patterns can also create favorable conditions for fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases to thrive, posing significant threats to crop health and productivity.  To mitigate the impacts of climate change on horticulture, growers need to adopt adaptive strategies that promote resilience and sustainability. One key approach is the selection and breeding of climate-resilient plant varieties that can withstand temperature extremes, water stress, and pest pressures. By incorporating traits such as heat tolerance, drought resistance, and disease resilience, breeders can develop cultivars that are better suited to the changing environmental conditions.  Furthermore, diversifying cropping systems can help buffer against climate variability and reduce risks associated with mono-cropping. Integrated pest management practices, such as biological control and crop rotation, can also help manage pest and disease pressures without relying heavily on chemical inputs that contribute to environmental degradation.  In addition to on-farm practices, improving soil health and fertility through sustainable management techniques, such as cover cropping, mulching, and composting, can enhance the resilience of horticultural systems to climate change. Healthy soils with high organic matter content have better water retention capacity, nutrient availability, and microbial diversity, which promote vigorous plant growth and overall ecosystem balance.  Moreover, adopting water-efficient irrigation technologies, such as drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting, can help conserve water resources and reduce reliance on unsustainable water sources. Water management practices, such as precision irrigation scheduling and soil moisture monitoring, can also optimize irrigation efficiency and minimize water wastage.  Educating growers about climate-smart horticultural practices and providing access to resources, such as weather forecasting tools, pest and disease monitoring systems, and sustainable production guidelines, are essential for building the resilience of the horticulture sector to climate change. Collaborative efforts between researchers, extension agents, policymakers, and farmers are crucial for developing and implementing strategies that address the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change.  In conclusion, climate change poses significant challenges to horticulture by altering temperature patterns, water availability, and pest dynamics. To adapt to these challenges, it is essential for growers to implement climate-smart practices that promote resilience, sustainability, and environmental stewardship. By embracing innovative technologies, diversifying cropping systems, enhancing soil health, and improving water management, horticulturists can mitigate the impacts of climate change and ensure the long-term productivity and viability of the sector.""","822"
"6176","""This report is aimed to provide an extensive overview of parasitic plants. This will be achieved by observing the different species, in particular the mistletoe families, and researching into how and why they paratisize their hosts. The distribution, human uses and ecological benefits of parasitic plants will also be looked at briefly within the report, in order to gain a basic understanding of their importance in different habitats and cultures. The different parasitic plant families are given in Appendix I. Parasites Parasites are organisms that are reliant on hosts for the production of nutriments. There are two main types of parasites, as described in Table. Table - Types of ParasitesFacultative Parasite: A parasite that is able to adapt to a changing habitat. It can be free-living, however, if conditions become unfavourable it can prey on host organisms to obtain nutrients. Obligate Parasite: A parasite that is unable to develop and grow autonomously, therefore relying on a host for survival.Parasitic plants either live in or on their hosts, penetrating through their roots or stems. However there are different types of parasitic plants, as shown in Table: Table - Types of Parasitic PlantsHemiparasite/ Semi-parasite: A parasite that relies on its host for half of its nutriment, but still able to photosynthesise, due to the production of chlorophyll. An example is the Eurasian the most common, however most common in temperate and boreal forest trees. The mycorrhizae create a larger surface area over which nutrients can be absorbed. Root parasites take advantage of the mycorrhizae and insert their haustorium in order to absorb the nutrients. An example is the holoparasitic Indian non-parasitic plants generally grow in a downward direction due to gravitational forces and away from light. However the Viscum album radicle, for example, grows in the direction of the host, whether it is towards light or opposing gravity. Once the radicle has reached the host plant it then transforms into a haustorium and perforates into the host's tissue, until it reaches the cambium. The circumference then increases and cortical strands grow from the haustorium, parallel to the cambium. Sinkers then form on the cortical strands as they touch the cambium, penetrating the a multitude of functions other than the penetration of the host to obtain nutriments via translocation. It also provides a structural support for the parasite given that it is the site of attachment to the host by means of hapteron, which 'secrete a polysaccharide adhesive'. HemiparasitesMistletoesMistletoes are vascular, hemiparasitic flowering plants that are found worldwide and in different forms, including, trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. There are two mistletoe families, Viscaceae and Loranthaceae, which originally belonged to the same family Loranthaceae. This division occurred due to the conspicuous differences between the two; the Viscaceae family all have relatively small, inconspicuous flowers, with red/white berries and are usually found in temperature regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The Loranthaceae family have much more ostentatious flowers and are found in tropical regions, for example, Nuytsia floribunda, the 'Christmas tree' found in Australia which blooms in December/January. Nuytsia floribunda is found in Australian heathlands, and can reach a height of up to forty five feet tall. Its roots produce white suckers that encircle and cut into a host's roots, the haustorium then diverts water and oval, green leaves and grows typically on deciduous trees. Mistle thrushes' (Turdus viscivorus) feed on the berries, depositing the sticky, intact seeds, usually onto berry-bearing trees. The northern populations of Turdus usually migratory in the winter to the Mediterranean, North Africa and Central Asia, and may deposit the seeds along these migratory routes. The sticky berries are usually deposited in strings held together by viscin and only a few other birds eat them, for example, black preys on cacti e.g. catclaw desert shrubs. The desert mistletoe produces red, sticky berries that many birds feed on, especially the silky pine trees as a host and produce white berries which burst when ripe, expelling their seeds at a high speed to other nearby trees. 'Seeds only mm long may shoot up to 9 feet laterally, with an initial velocity of about 2 miles per hour.' A number of mistletoe's create galls, which are masses of woody tissue that surround infected areas on their hosts. The galls are where the haustoria once penetrated the host, and many remain even after the death of the mistletoe. Coniferous trees obtain a gall-like structure known as a 'witches broom', which is where the infected branches become very dense. Tropical mistletoe can cause mutations in the host's bark, called 'wood roses'. The local people in Mexico and Bali use these intricate imprints to create delicate woodcarvings for decoration or to sell to tourists. Mistletoe also has an ecological importance as a source of food and shelter; mistletoe on the stem during the larval stage, Hypseloecus visci, a rare sap-sucking bug and the mistletoe tortrix larvae mine through the leaf tissue, all feed on Viscum album, during the spring and summer. Strangler fig The strangler within the boughs of trees in the canopy. As it develops it grows down and around the truck of its host, attaching its haustoria to its host's roots, whilst constricting it. A hollow structure remains once the host has died. The death of the host is usually due to the parasite gaining the majority of nutrients from the soil and shielding the hosts leaves from light in the canopy. Occasionally more than one fig may paratisize the same host, entwining their roots and as a result appearing to be a single tree. The different trees, however, tend to flower and fruit on separate occasions, subsequently providing important sources of food in the rainforests. HoloparasitesMonotropa a root parasite that when flowers pushes through leaf litter to expose a white/transparent, bell-shaped head. This parasitic plant completely lacks chlorophyll and obtains it nutrients from the roots and mycorrhiza of coniferous trees. Raffleisa arnoldii is an endoparasite, that lives completely inside the tissues of the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra, although it erupts from the woody vine when flowering. The Raffleisa arnoldii produces the largest, single flower in the plant world. The female flower has five, thick and leathery orange/red petals that open to up to one meter in diameter. The flower is pollinated by insects, in particular flies, which are attracted to the redolence of rotting flesh. The male flower, however, is pollinated by small mammals and are much more abundant than the female flower. Cuscuta spp. (dodder/witches hair) is an obligate parasite, with an unusual appearance, considering that it grows as a mass of string-like strands, engulfing anything in its path to lengths of up to half a mile. Cuscuta is very versatile and is therefore found in a variety of habitats, for example, Cuscuta marina is salt tolerant and is commonly found in and along salt marshes. Pilostyles thurberi is an endoparasite, meaning that it lives in the stem of the host, apart from when it flowers. The haustorium is fibrous and penetrates the host's vascular tissue by means of a sinker. Fungus a parasitic plant that spends the majority of its life underground obtaining nutriments from its most parts of the world. The spread of parasitic weeds have been helped greatly by human interactions, especially root parasites, for example the Cuscata and Striga families. Therefore quarantine measures have been set up to prevent the spread of destructive parasitic weeds around the world. most damaging to maize, sorghum and a number of other grasses, whereas tomatoes and beans and dodder is a particular problem on alfalfa, for example. Although quarantine measures are set up to help prevent the spread of parasitic weeds, once they have contaminated a crop it is extremely difficult to eradicate due to the minuscule seeds produced that are effectively distributed via the wind and persist in the soil. Human UsesHumans have used parasitic plants for a number of reasons over the centuries. Numerous parasitic plants have and are been believed to have medicinal properties and curative values. Others have been used as herbal teas, for example, Euphrasia and Pedicularis,, or from the host to the plant is likely. Therefore care is needed before using parasitic plants in medicine and food. The flower buds of Raffleisa tengku-adlinii, when boiled are said to induce the labour of pregnant women and to help mothers gain their strength after the birth. A few root parasites accrue subsequently have been used as anti-diarrhoeal remedies, for example, Prosopanche, has been used in Argentina, and Krameria has been used in Central and South America,. Mistletoe has been used for many different medicinal cures all over the world throughout the years. In Africa, it was used as a cure for convulsive distempers, to relieve digestive distress in Canada, and as aphrodisiacs for the Mayans and in the Mediterranean. Not only have humans used parasitic plants for numerous medicinal reasons, but have also associated a number of folklores with them. The European been used to symbolise good fortune, and pagan rituals. It is also used in Christmas festivities; when placed above doorways couples share a kiss when stood underneath. This tradition is believed to have originated from the belief that mistletoe aided the fertility of women, and was used when conception of a child was desired. European mistletoe was also believed to have been 'sent to earth by Gods' and that the mistle the 'messenger'. It was therefore believed to have healing powers and people drank it in tea and wore it as amulets. European mistletoe when grown on oak trees was believed, by the Druids, to symbolise 'human dependency on God', and the oak tree represented 'God'. It was therefore used to scare away evil spirits, a good-luck charm and to create a warm atmosphere in the home within the winter months. A few parasitic plants have also been used as a source of food for humans in different locations around the world, either as a staple part of the diet or when other food sources are scarce. Parasitic plants are also a source of food for other animals; for example, mistletoe can often provide deer and elk as a source of food in the winter months. Appendix I looks briefly at other uses of parasitic plants. ConclusionThere is a diverse range of parasitic plant species found all over the world that live in a variety of habitats, and have adapted different ways in which to obtain nutrients from their hosts. Although parasitic plants may harm their hosts, they are very important ecologically, economically and socially. The provide food for a number of different species ranging from insects to humans. The root structures of parasites have provided an income for some indigenous people who create and sell the handcrafted woodcarvings. Parasitic plants have also provided a basis for local discussion derived from folklores, and festive traditions.""","""Parasitic Plants and Their Importance""","2428","""Parasitic plants are unique organisms that have evolved to depend on other plants or fungi for nutrients and support. While they may seem like botanical villains, draining resources from their hosts, they play crucial roles in various ecosystems worldwide. Understanding parasitic plants and their importance sheds light on the complex interactions within nature and highlights the interconnectedness of all living organisms.  Parasitic plants have a specialized mode of nutrition called heterotrophy, where they rely on other organisms for sustenance. Unlike autotrophic plants that can produce their food through photosynthesis, parasitic plants lack the ability to harness sunlight to synthesize nutrients. Instead, they have evolved various strategies to leech off other plants, also known as hosts, to acquire water, minerals, and organic compounds necessary for their survival. This unique adaptation has allowed parasitic plants to thrive in habitats where traditional autotrophic plants struggle to survive.  One of the most well-known examples of parasitic plants is the dodder (Cuscuta spp.), a plant that lacks roots and leaves but can wrap itself around a host plant and extract nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. Dodder plants detect chemical cues released by potential hosts and then twine around them to establish connections for nutrient extraction. This intimate parasitic relationship between dodder and its host demonstrates the complex mechanisms that have evolved over time between these organisms.  Parasitic plants come in various forms, ranging from root parasites like broomrape (Orobanche spp.) and witchweed (Striga spp.) to stem parasites like mistletoe (Viscum album) and Indian paintbrush (Castilleja spp.). Each type of parasitic plant has unique adaptations that allow them to exploit different hosts and environments effectively. For example, root parasites have evolved specialized structures to penetrate host roots and extract nutrients, while stem parasites rely on haustoria to tap into the vascular system of their hosts.  Despite their reputation as """"plant vampires,"""" parasitic plants play essential roles in ecosystems around the world. One of the key roles of parasitic plants is their contribution to biodiversity. By targeting specific host plants, parasitic plants influence the distribution and abundance of plant species in an ecosystem. This selective pressure can promote the coexistence of different plant species by preventing a single dominant species from monopolizing available resources.  Additionally, parasitic plants can influence ecosystem dynamics and nutrient cycling. By tapping into the nutrient pools of their hosts, parasitic plants can redistribute resources within an ecosystem, affecting the growth and development of both the host plant and other organisms in the ecosystem. This nutrient transfer can have cascading effects on the entire food web, influencing not only plant communities but also herbivores, predators, and decomposers.  Another crucial aspect of the importance of parasitic plants lies in their medicinal and cultural significance. Several parasitic plants have been used in traditional medicine for their therapeutic properties. For example, mistletoe has been used in European folk medicine for its potential anti-cancer properties, while sandalwood (Santalum album) is valued for its fragrant wood and essential oils.  Moreover, parasitic plants have cultural and ecological significance in various indigenous communities. Mistletoe, for example, has been revered in Celtic and Norse traditions as a symbol of fertility and protection. In Australia, mistletoe plays a vital role in the ecology of the iconic mistletoebird, which acts as a pollinator and seed disperser for mistletoe species.  From an evolutionary perspective, parasitic plants provide insights into the mechanisms of host-parasite coevolution. The arms race between parasitic plants and their hosts has led to the development of sophisticated adaptations on both sides. Host plants have evolved defense mechanisms to detect and resist parasitic attacks, such as producing toxins or inducing structural changes to limit haustoria penetration. In response, parasitic plants have evolved strategies to overcome host defenses and establish successful parasitic relationships.  The study of parasitic plants also has practical implications for agriculture and ecosystem management. While parasitic plants can have detrimental effects on crop yields and natural habitats, understanding their biology and ecology can help develop strategies for their control and conservation. Integrated pest management techniques, such as crop rotation, biological control using natural enemies of parasitic plants, and the use of parasitic plant-resistant crop varieties, can help mitigate the impact of parasitic plants on agriculture.  In conclusion, parasitic plants are fascinating organisms that challenge our understanding of plant biology and ecosystem dynamics. Despite their reputation as """"plant vampires,"""" parasitic plants play important roles in maintaining biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem resilience. By studying parasitic plants, we gain valuable insights into the intricate relationships between organisms in nature and the mechanisms that drive coevolution and adaptation. Embracing the complexity of parasitic plants can enhance our appreciation for the richness and diversity of life on Earth.""","979"

Results - All measurements and resultsThe st accurate is an anomalous result so it is discarded.. to the methodology and apparatus used, there are both a fairly high degree of minor sources of errors, lead to an anomalous result: The main source of error is probably the personal end point, which is when the solution in the conical flask changes colour from colourless to the first permanent pale pink as the flask is swirled. It is always difficult to be able to control the run down of NaOH. It usually ends up with varied pale pink densities. On the other hand, it is much more accurate also to measure the absorbance of solution using a photospectrometer at an appropriate wavelength. It is expected that the higher the absorbance value the higher the pink intensity, thus a positive correlation. C H O K is a stable and non-hygroscopic chemical which is easy to store. It can be readily made up as a standard solution, the primary standard. It has a relatively high molar mass, thus to reduce weighing error, which has also been reduced by using an accurate four-decimal-place electronic scale in weighing. However, the low water solubility of C H O K and grinding manually that are likely to be uneven. This can be improved by using powder C H O K in order to demonstrate a fairer test and to obtain more reliable and valid results. It is good to have rinsed the weighing boat, stirring rod and the funnel after each transfer, and then the washings were added to the flask. Ideally, the number of transfers should be kept at minimum. The more the transfers of the substances, the more the errors caused. Thus the validity of the results is affected. Accurate equipment is used e.g. 5/80cm Graduated flask and 0cm - pipette. It is preferred to vortex the solution of C H O K and distilled water to ensure complete mixing. It is important to keep the consistency: either to add two or three drops of indicator in every titration. A new dry conical flask should be used for each titration, to avoid incompletely cleaned and dry ones, thus to affect the results. It is crucial to keep the burette straight, parallel to the clamp stand and perpendicular to the bench, when reading the burette volumes. ConclusionThe titration is carried out reasonably successfully so that NaOH concentration is calculated as. reminded.""","""Acid-base titration techniques and procedures""","795","""Acid-base titration is a fundamental analytical technique used to determine the concentration of an acid or base in a solution. This process involves carefully adding a solution of known concentration (titrant) to a solution of unknown concentration until the reaction between the acid and base is complete. The endpoint of the titration, often determined by a color change indicator or a pH meter, indicates when stoichiometric equivalence has been reached. This technique is widely used in chemistry labs, industries, and research settings. Let's delve into the techniques and procedures involved in acid-base titrations.  Firstly, the equipment needed for an acid-base titration typically includes a burette, a pipette, a conical flask, a magnetic stirrer, an indicator (such as phenolphthalein or methyl orange), and a suitable primary standard solution. The primary standard solution should be a pure substance with high purity and known concentration to ensure accurate results.  To perform an acid-base titration, the first step is to accurately measure a volume of the unknown solution using a pipette and transfer it to a conical flask. It is essential to record this initial volume for calculations later on. The next step involves adding a few drops of the chosen indicator to the solution in the conical flask. The indicator helps visualize the endpoint of the titration by changing color when the reaction is complete.  After preparing the solution, the titration can commence by filling the burette with the titrant solution. The burette is then carefully positioned above the conical flask, and the titrant is slowly added drop by drop to the unknown solution while swirling the flask gently. The goal is to reach the endpoint where the indicator changes color permanently.  During the titration process, it is crucial to approach the endpoint cautiously as overshooting can lead to erroneous results. As the endpoint is approached, the titrant should be added dropwise while monitoring the color change carefully. At the endpoint, the indicator will change color permanently, signaling that the reaction is balanced and the equivalence point has been reached.  Calculating the concentration of the unknown acid or base involves using the concept of stoichiometry and the known concentration of the titrant. The volume and concentration of the titrant used at the endpoint are crucial for determining the concentration of the unknown solution through simple mathematical calculations.  There are different types of acid-base titrations based on the nature of reactants involved. Strong acid-strong base titrations involve the reaction between a strong acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid) and a strong base (e.g., sodium hydroxide). Weak acid-strong base titrations involve the reaction between a weak acid (e.g., acetic acid) and a strong base. Similarly, weak base-strong acid titrations involve the reaction between a weak base and a strong acid.  In conclusion, acid-base titration is a versatile technique used to determine the concentration of acids and bases accurately. Mastery of the techniques and procedures involved in acid-base titrations is essential for obtaining reliable and precise results. Understanding the principles of stoichiometry, using appropriate indicators, and following meticulous laboratory practices are key to successful titrations. By mastering these techniques, chemists can gain valuable insights into the chemical composition of solutions and make informed decisions in various scientific fields.""","664"
"29","""Although the Declaration of Independence was officially ratified on th July 776, now known as Independence Day, the process of gradual colonial independence from Britain had begun long before this historic day. However, this essay will argue that independence was not assured until after July th 776, because the war with Britain still had to be won. It is important to distinguish between when the Americans first declared independence and when it actually became inevitable. Britain was not simply going to acquiesce and let the Americans proclaim independence without resistance. Over decades, however, the Americans formed their own cultural identity and no longer felt as connected to the British as previously. A feeling of animosity subsequently developed especially over the issue of taxation which ultimately was one of the main factors in leading to the War of Independence. Even when war broke out between the two nations, independence was not the main objective for the colonies, because Americans were fighting purely for the defence of their rights. The turning point in terms of the Americans uniting behind the cause was in early 776, but independence only finally became inevitable after the battle of Saratoga in spring 777 where the Americans were victorious and the consequences of this battle were crucial in leading to Britain's defeat and accordingly to independence. A change in cultural identity was the first step on the road to independence for the colonies. This took place gradually over decades and by the 760s the majority of America's population had not been born in Britain. Indeed, in the oldest colonies of Virginia and New England, there were sixth and seventh generation Americans. Also, a significant proportion of the population was not even of British ethnicity as the make-up of the American population included a huge diversity of people, with large minorities of French, German, Dutch and Africans. These people had never been loyal to the British crown and they were constantly increasing in number as the new immigrants tended to originate less and less from Britain. The vast majority of the population which had originally come from Britain, left there because they were unhappy with their situation anyway. They often felt that something was 'missing' and many migrated to the colonies to start a new life, seek a fresh start - one which was unavailable in Britain. That is, they were unlikely to be ultra-loyal to Britain anyway. Events which were unique to the colonies such as the Great Awakening also helped to foster a sense of common identity because Britain was not involved. Overall, whereas previously their situations had been similar, the life of the average American was now hugely different from the life of the average Englishman. It was certainly no co-incidence that at the same time the Americans were just beginning to form their own separate cultural identity from Britain, the British were exercising loose control over the colonies anyway - 'The preoccupation of Englishmen with their own affairs had resulted in general indifference to America and ignorance of her problems.' This meant that the Americans already had a degree of semi-independence. This trend towards looser control had been increasing ever since the Glorious Revolution. The colonies also thought that because they had participated in the Glorious Revolution, they too deserved to share the rights which the Englishmen had been granted as the result of the Revolution in 690 such as a liberal constitutional government. They saw themselves as equals to the British and not subordinates. Therefore, the fact that the Americans were gradually beginning to develop their own sense of identity, as well as the British exercising looser control over the colonies were the first step towards independence, but there was still a long way to go. Dora Mae Clark, British Opinion and the American laws led to resistance, including the Boston Tea Party in December 773 where the colonists dumped newly imported tea into the harbour. This in turn put pressure on the British troops to act in response, who were unfamiliar in dealing with civilians. Neither side was willing to back down, as there was an issue of intransigence both from Britain and the colonies. The situation worsened with both sides becoming increasingly suspicious of each other and their views became further entrenched. Conflict was the result. In April 775/8 the British army set out to seize arsenal from the Americans at Concord where they were met with resistance and the result was the first blood being spilt in the battles of Lexington and Concord. However, the Americans were certainly not fighting for independence but instead to secure and defend their rights from the British who they regarded as tyrants - 'The war which began in the chill of the dawn at Lexington was waged. in defense of the American rights within the British Empire.' It is true that 'a few Americans, including the astute Samuel Adams, were virtually advocating independence as early as the fall of 774', but the vast majority simply did not feel that way - 'until the end of 775/8, the word 'independence' remained almost unspoken.' Both sides essentially still wanted peace, and America even rejected foreign aid from France and Spain as it did not want to escalate the conflict despite the fact that with these two allies, it stood a far greater chance of winning the war. However, over the next few years, the situation began to change. It became clear that Britain would only try to solve its difficulties in America with force and the colonists re-evaluated their position. 'Lexington, Concord, Bunker Hill and minor military clashes in the summer and fall of 775/8 abruptly changed the political objectives of the struggle.' The war provided the colonists with a common danger and common enemy by uniting Americans behind a worthwhile cause: independence. This change in the population's views occurred during late 775/8 and early 776 and the conflict became the War of Independence. 'On July, 776, after much debate and soul searching, they announced the secession of the Thirteen Colonies from the British Empire and the birth of a new nation, the United States of America.' Therefore, it is important to understand that when the primary objective of the war changed from the defence of rights to that of fighting for independence, a huge step towards realizing independence had been taken. Pauline Maier, From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain, 765/8-776 (London, 973), p. John Richard Alden, The American Revolution: 775/8-783 (New York, 95/84), p. 1 Ibid, p. Countryman, p. 09 Ibid, p. 3 Ibid, p. 3 However, there was a vast difference in declaring independence and actually achieving it - 'It was one thing to assert independence. It was another matter to attain it.' The Americans still had to defeat the might of the British army - the best trained and equipped in the world. The first few years of the war were characterized by unimportant battles in which neither side made progress. The Americans certainly did not look like achieving their independence in the near future. However, the turning point of the war and consequently the moment when independence became inevitable was undoubtedly at the battle of Saratoga in autumn 777 in which the Americans defeated the British army and forced the surrender of almost,00 troops. Although the war did continue for another five years, American victory was now almost totally assured and independence became inevitable. It was the battle of Saratoga which 'rescued the American war effort from what looked. to be an inevitable and humiliating disaster, without Saratoga the Americans might well have sued for peace.' Its importance cannot be underestimated for a large number of reasons. It was the first significant American military victory and showed that Britain could be defeated in open battle. This further helped to boost the independence cause among the people because it proved to be a huge propaganda boost. It also damaged the English appetite for war and meant that from here on, the British were less willing to commit so many troops and resources to the war. Finally, and most importantly 'it propelled the French into a long-contemplated declaration of global war on Britain.' This meant that America now had the military strength to match its ideological fervour and therefore could over-power the British army in the war and finally win independence. Ibid, p. 0 Robert Harvey, A Few Bloody Noses: The American War of Independence (London, 001), p. 82 Ibid, p. 82 Therefore, in conclusion, independence was a long and complicated process that took decades to achieve, only becoming inevitable with the military victory at Saratoga. It started with a gradual change in cultural identity as the Americans started to feel less attached to a Britain which exerted less influence over the colonies. The Seven Years' War and its effects were the next step as Britain began to reassert itself over the colonies firstly with the deployment of troops, which greatly angered the Americans, and secondly and more importantly with the constant attempts to tax the colonists. This led to resistance and eventually to war. However, the fact that the Americans were at war with Britain did not signify that independence was inevitable. Far from it - as they were merely fighting to defend their rights. The objective of the war did gradually change and independence was declared on th July 776, but this still did not mean that independence was inevitable, as they had to defeat the strongest military power in the world. Only with the victory at Saratoga did independence become certain, because it was the first major battle of the war and America was victorious. It was also a huge propaganda boost, uniting the people, damaging Britain's enthusiasm for the conflict and finally propelling France into the war. Victory in the War of Independence had now finally become inevitable - 'the question whether or not the colonies would remain under the British Empire was then and there decided. the war continued to patriot victory.' Alden, p. 0""","""American Independence and Cultural Identity""","1984","""American Independence and Cultural Identity  American Independence in 1776 marked a pivotal moment in history, shaping the cultural identity of a nation still celebrated today. The journey towards independence was a complex one, driven by various factors that not only impacted political dynamics but also influenced the cultural landscape of the United States. The struggle for independence was not merely a fight against British colonial rule but a quest for self-determination and the establishment of a unique American identity.  One of the key elements that contributed to the development of American cultural identity was the diversity of the population. The American colonies were a melting pot of different cultures, religions, and ethnicities. This diversity fostered a sense of unity in the face of a common enemy during the Revolutionary War. The rallying cry of """"no taxation without representation"""" resonated with people from various backgrounds, leading them to join forces in the fight for independence. This shared struggle created a sense of solidarity and laid the foundation for a unified American identity that transcended individual differences.  The principles of the American Revolution, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, played a significant role in shaping the cultural values of the new nation. The ideals of liberty, equality, and democracy became central tenets of American identity, influencing how people viewed themselves and their place in society. The concept of individual rights and the pursuit of happiness became defining aspects of the American ethos, setting the nation apart from its European counterparts.  The American Revolution also had a profound impact on the arts and literature. Writers and artists of the time, such as Thomas Paine and Benjamin West, used their talents to promote the cause of independence and inspire a sense of national pride. The art and literature of the period reflected the ideals of the Revolution, celebrating the virtues of freedom and democracy. These cultural expressions helped solidify a distinct American identity and contributed to the creation of a national mythology that continues to shape the country's identity today.  The legacy of American Independence continues to influence the nation's cultural identity in contemporary times. The Fourth of July, celebrated as Independence Day, serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by the founding fathers and the struggles endured to secure freedom and autonomy. The American flag, the bald eagle, and other symbols of the nation's heritage evoke a sense of patriotism and pride among its citizens, reinforcing a collective sense of identity rooted in the ideals of the Revolution.  Furthermore, American cultural identity is constantly evolving, shaped by the ongoing efforts to uphold the values of liberty, equality, and democracy. The Civil Rights Movement, the Women's Rights Movement, and other social and political developments have challenged the nation to live up to its founding principles and strive for a more inclusive and equitable society. These movements have redefined what it means to be American, emphasizing the importance of diversity, tolerance, and social justice in shaping the nation's cultural identity.  In conclusion, American Independence has played a fundamental role in shaping the cultural identity of the United States. The struggle for independence brought together a diverse population under a common cause, laying the groundwork for a unified national identity. The values and ideals of the American Revolution continue to influence the nation's cultural landscape, inspiring pride, patriotism, and a commitment to liberty and equality. As the United States continues to evolve, its cultural identity remains rooted in the principles that emerged during the quest for independence, embodying the enduring legacy of a nation forged in the fires of revolution.""","682"
"130","""Breaking formally with Spain in 821, postcolonial Peru would witness significant changes in the state's approach to its indigenous majority and the 'Indian problem'. Peru emerged after independence as thoroughly divided, comprising an ethnically heterogeneous peasant mass scattered throughout a diverse landscape, and a small pool of largely city-residing elites determined to secure national progress. Influenced by the core ideals of La Ilustracion and a Bolivarian desire to extirpate colonialism's despotic legacy, the limeno ruling class pursued a republican project of integration to secure its position at the apex of national authority. In line with this enterprising trajectory, the tribute and provincial cacique systems were abolished in the immediate post-independence years, furthering the colonial assault on the indigenous nobility begun in the wake of the Tupac Amaru rebellion of 780. In irrigating the coastal economy, a thirty-year guano export boom would however effectively undermine state-sierra relations and Creole attention to the hinterlands, facilitating the rise of a regional caudillismo. Despite the liberal republican discourse fuelling a modernising drive, Indians were routinely contained along established lines of 'paternalistic exploitation', the contradictions of which would come to enhance their political consciousness and inspire salient instances of revolt. While elite interests lobbied for power, the desire to erode communal landholdings and penetrate the Andean interior would inflame civil tensions. Coinciding with the consolidation of liberal control in the 870s, local rebellions became increasingly more frequent, their characteristics and intensity reflecting the interplay of regionally-specific geographic and socio-economic conditions. Broadly speaking, the War of the precipitate greater peasant organisation, and nourish disenchantment with a national project that undermined basic rights. With the government aspiring to heightened implementation of individual taxation via the contribucion personal, a renewed integrationist drive further antagonised regional disdain, underpinning a sharpened indigenous reaction to state designs on community life. Though these developments implied a marked growth in Indians' conception of the nation, prevailing Creole interpretation came to belittle such protest, returning to lament the problem of a backward, unassimilated peasant majority. Both as communities and individuals, Indians could by the century's closure more readily envisage the construction of a nation, though this did not universally transpire as a desire to belong.

In Maybury-Lewis,.44 In the immediate period preceding independence, the Peruvian State sought to modernise its relationship to its indigenous subjects by repealing the tribute system in 810. Though Peru had declared its separation from the peninsula in 821 - one of the last of the South American colonies to do so - the Royalist cause would not be entirely undone until the defeat of the remaining Spanish forces some three years later at Ayacucho. While the 'foreign' armies of Simon Bolivar and Jose de San Martin directed much of the republican cause, Indian participation in defence of an emergent patria was of central importance. Far from imbuing the nation's leadership with confidence however, this mobilisation incited Creole fears of latent peasant uprising. Although Indian involvement in independence aroused hopes widespread faith in the nation-state, limeno elites regarded an integrationist drive as imperative to cement their authority, particularly in areas of the central sierra where communities had fought loyally for the Royalist cause. Adding substance to the prevailing enlightenment and modernising ideals, the decrees of San Martin in 821 and Bolivar in 825/8 outlawing personal service enshrined a liberal trajectory and provided the impetus for penetration of the Andes.

(Cusco, 991) P.6 While acquiring a republican gloss, the assault on provincial power was nevertheless in many respects a continuation of colonial attempts to erode the authority of the caciques; a policy undertaken in earnest following the tumultuous 'Great Rebellion' of 780 led by Tupac Amaru II. Though Creole rhetoric would actively deny the political capacity of the peasantry, such insurrection hinted at a developing indigenous consciousness, rooted in acute aversion to intervention in local authority. In general, Creole distaste for the Indian was manifold, rejecting the preference for ostensibly inferior indigenous tongues such as Quechua over Spanish, superstitious syncretic Catholic practises, and an apparently innate aversion to private property and enterprise. Despite the optimistic proclamations of revolutionary leaders, the geographical and ideological gulf between the capital and hinterlands remained great, and the government would face much peasant opposition to efforts at enhanced assimilation.

(Lima, 990) P.14 In an era in which Enlightenment principles of liberty, equality, and citizenship featured strongly, the divisions created by ethno-cultural, economic, and class differences proved problematic to a state model seeking to increase its sovereignty. Geographically, the nation comprised three distinct areas: a 'desert-like' pacific coast, the mountainous Andean range, and a set of low tropical valleys in the eastern Amazon basin. Such dissimilarity served to highlight the physical and psychological distance between regions, and resultant lack of a common identity and history for their inhabitants. Ethnic heterogeneity further eroded a sense of universality; both in terms of internal distinctions between indigenous groups and divisions along caste lines of white, mestizo, Indian, black, and Chinese. According to an 812 estimate, Peru constituted some,09,11 inhabitants, of whom 78,25/8 were Spanish, 5/84,99 Indian, 87,86 mestizo, and 9,41 black slaves. With the indigenous bulk of this population scattered across the vast central highlands, Indian communities remained fragmented sites of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity stretching back beyond pre-conquest times. While they acknowledged, and would often rebel against, an overbearing national authority, individual Indian communities did not at this stage project a sense of solidarity with one another, much less an idea of the nation as a whole. Piel, 'The place of the peasantry,' P.10 Piel, 'The place of the peasantry,' P.11 Though burgeoning in a political climate rich in republican ideals, integrationist approaches to the Indian majority initially took something of a backseat as different interests lobbied for power. Within the ruling class, the nation's incipient years were characterised by the tension between liberal republicanism's desire to engender progress and curb colonial excesses, and a conservative mould sharing much of its views with the former Spanish authorities. In cementing control of the government, church, army, education, and commerce, conservative interests would essentially dominate. In any case, a degree of merging of conservative and liberal thought transpired in the late 820s, reflecting fears of the insurrectionary potential of the interior and a consequent preoccupation with securing law and discipline. Divisions were nonetheless still pronounced over attitudes to the guerrilla bands occupying the capital's surrounding area, with breakaway portions of the liberal contingent seeking alliance with bandolero leaders. Though prominent conservatives would dismiss bandoleros and montoneros alike as common crooks and renounce political agency on their part, the presence of undesirable peasant groups proved central to debates around citizenship. Basadre, Historia de la Republica del Peru. Volume I P.34 Walker, 'Montoneros, Bandoleros, Malhechores.' P.10 Walker, 'Montoneros, Bandoleros, Malhechores.' P.10 Elite aversion to mobilised clans aside, these groups can commonly be regarded as exhibiting political consciousness, both in terms of demonstrating demands of the state and reacting to those identified as opposition. Moreover, by exemplifying a direct challenge to national authority, those involved in civil strife informed state definitions of the merits of the ideal citizen. Following San Martin's sweeping promotion of the Indian masses as 'Peruanos', Lima's elites set about contemplating what constituted an originario republicano. Of central importance was the payment of a 'contribution' to the state treasury, usurping the tributo traditionally administered by ethnic chieftains. As the historian Mark Thurner elucidates, citizenship also progressively entailed taking unremunerated community posts, and participation in both public works labour and a newly conceived 'labor brigade service'. Walker, 'Montoneros, Bandoleros, Malhechores.' P.09 Thurner, From Two Republics to One Divided. P.0 Though this ambitious construction of a postcolonial nation implied commitment to an inclusive political system, the sense of two polarized worlds provided by the legacy of the dual republicas system was to be deeply entrenched. Profoundly concerned with securing national progress, Creole ideology's overriding view of a disparate indigenous mass thus became that of an obstacle to be overcome, with competing lines of debate revolving around the imperative drive towards modernity. The weakness of government authority would however preclude an extensive overthrow of the traditional tributary system, leading Indians to remain largely subjects of provincial landowners. Given this frailty, the nascent state was obliged to uphold the colonial model of local authority to bolster its position and secure the C riollo class at the peak of the social hierarchy. With the cacique nobility remaining theoretically outlawed and Lima's courts passing a community land privatisation law in 828, the emergent liberal thrust was not to be undone, but Peru's formative years essentially heralded an endeavour to impose a republican status on the existing structure. Mark Thurner, 'Peruvian Genealogies of History and Nation.' In Thurner, Mark; and Guerrero, Andres (eds.), After Spanish rule: postcolonial predicaments of the Americas. (Durham, 003) P.41 Cesar Fonseca Martel, 'Peasant Differentiation in the Peruvian Andes.' In Stein,.27 In spite then of the progressive slant of elite discourse, the postcolonial system essentially upheld a reworked paradigm of paternalistic exploitation rooted in local authority. In line with republican distaste for provincial nobility, the kuraka aristocracy was replaced officially by the 'varayoc'; a position filled by village leaders who would organise tax collection. Equally, the state saw fit to increase the numbers employed within the temporal alcalde role, the aim being to ensure greater regulation and monitoring of taxation, and to provide a fertile climate for individualism, property ownership, and stability. In usurping the last vestiges of the Inca nobility, alcaldes were expressly appointed for their loyalty and fiscal obligation, and enjoyed privileges such as tax exempt status for their support. In the 830s, these officials were regarded as instrumental in furthering the drive to weaken regional political autonomy, especially within problematic areas such as the Cuzco department where memory of the erstwhile Tawantisuyo, the Inca realm, remained strong even after centuries of Spanish colonial rule. As the historian Victor Peralta Ruiz highlights, though the varayoc tended to attain a greater quotidian presence than their alcalde counterparts and preside for 'un tiempo indefinido en su cargo', the two positions would increasingly be identified as one and the same as the century progressed. While it would not prove immediately enforceable, a later abolition of tribute in 85/84 would provide renewed anti-cacique legalisation, affirming the decline in kuraka authority. Following the influx of these new external officials, the power and position of the cacicazgo was gradually eroded, as much in terms of mercantile participation as community prestige. Basadre, Historia de la Republica del Peru. Volume I. P.63 Peralta Ruiz, En pos del tributo. P.11 Peralta Ruiz, En pos del tributo. P.12 Given the strength of regional ethnic ties however, this is not to credit the authorities with attaining a precipitous penetration of the highlands, as the void between Creole and Indian worlds remained considerable. In seeking to undermine local cultures, integrationist efforts would inadvertently bridge the cultural and economic dimensions of Indians' existing grievances, intensifying chagrin and inclination towards revolt. The endorsements of progressive liberal ideology notwithstanding, the issue of achieving an efficacious form of centralised state control would prove as elusive for republican officials as it had their Spanish predecessors. The struggle to develop civil and economic links between Peru's multifarious isolated mountain communities and lowland semi-tropical valleys remained unresolved and indeed exacerbated by the country's changing political realities. Despite the Bolivarian rhetoric, a boom within the guano nitrate export sector would irrigate the coast, effectively stalling elite concerns for the interior. Growing rich from this burgeoning economic activity in the period 830-0, the elite developed indifference towards the nation's founding republican spirit..69 Larson, Andean Highland Peasants and the trials of Nation Making during the Nineteenth Century. P.41 Being highly detrimental towards local economies in destroying crops and livestock, Chilean incursions thus often fomented peasant mobilisation. Whilst President Iglesias negotiated the cessation of hostilities under the Treaty of Ancon in 883, General Andres Caceres continued to oversee a popular resistance in the Mantaro region. Though many were involved in incidents of banditry and opportunistic abuse, the war provided indigenous participants an avenue towards greater appreciation of belonging to a wider cause. In defending a region from a foreign threat, the conflict permitted the forging of an enhanced consciousness of inter-community identities, helping to establish 'bonds of solidarity'. Practically speaking, this entailed attrition of longstanding ethnic tensions between Indian groups that had considered themselves culturally and often linguistically distinct from their neighbours, as the Tupac Amaru rebellion had achieved some one hundred years before. By illuminating both the state's exploitation and inability to protect its citizens, the war granted Indians a greater sense of sharing a common experience. Particularly after the withdrawal of Chilean forces, peasant mobilisation sustained instability in the central sierra, creating a pervasive sense of a rejection of Lima's nation making project. If the war advanced the state's concept of national consciousness for the masses, it did not appear to be endorsed by many. Larson, Andean Highland Peasants and the trials of Nation Making during the Nineteenth Century. P.41 Bonilla, 'The War of the Pacific.' P.15/8 Puente Candamo, La Independencia del Peru. P.2 Bonilla, 'The War of the Pacific.' P.15/8 This is not to suggest however that the composition of wartime peasant reaction and civil conflict within Peru's hinterlands was uniform, nor that uprising was merely the product of a unified objection to state and regional elite authority. Though the war provided the stimulus for civil strife in many regions, it did not spark a universal lower-class revolt. Based on the idoneo-led Montenera bands of poor peasants, Caceres's continued resistance overtly undermined state efforts at pacification, eliciting a diverse range of reactions from regional class interests. Within communities, support for the breakaway general depended on a complex interaction of factors, particularly the shape of local power dynamics and the extent of geo-political detachment from centralised authority. Within the Mantaro Valley in the Junin department, something of a north-south divide developed based on differing socio-economic and cultural characteristics. In the valley's south around the Huancayo province, the prolonged destructive presence of the Chilean forces - and the collaborationist stance adopted by prominent local landowners like Jacinto Cevallos - inspired the projection of a class-based proto-nationalism on the part of the local peasantry. Possessing sufficient power to mobilise, the peasantry fought both the Chilean invader and higher-class interests alike, articulating a love for the homeland as the place in which one was born, drew subsistence, and prospered. Conversely, with a relatively lesser Chilean presence and greater entwining of interests, Mantaro's northern social groups did not to replicate the mutual hostility of their southern counterparts, instead proffering a multi-class defence of the land. This owed much to the relative local impotence of the montoneras: the northern elite, feeling less threatened, could more readily assert their support for Caceres. Reflecting the local elite's dominance, peasant nationalism was not be given the same opportunity to develop, with the lower class remaining more easily controlled. Mallon, Peasant and Nation P.85/8 Mallon, 'Comas and the War of the Pacific.' P.77 Mallon, 'Comas and the War of the Pacific.' P.79 In the north-western Department of Cajamarca, a unique set of circumstances spawned an alternative national resistance, rooted in an alliance between the elite and peasantry in rebellion against the state. Dismayed by the government's inability to counter the invasion, local landowners and merchants directed the peasantry in an effective challenge of the Chilean forces. The ability to formulate and manipulate a multi-class, multi-ethnic resistance owed much to the lack of strong native roots in the region. For the village peasantry, the absence of a communal tradition was further compounded by the paucity of economic opportunities, reducing the bulk of the population to a virtual serfdom perpetuated by hacendado control over the land. With peasants confined to dependence on the local patron, regional confrontation had not been characterised by agrarian class conflict, but rather by feuds and competition internal to the land-owning social tier. In the context of a wartime defence of land and property, this situation afforded the peasantry little opportunity to attain a cohesive struggle autonomous from the interests of their social superiors. Mallon, Peasant and Nation. P.30/ Mallon, Peasant and Nation. P.32 With Miguel Iglesias presiding over weak political legitimacy in the post-war period, a strictly indigenous disaffection with the state would however gain momentum in parts of the country more conducive to independent protest, materialising most palpably as the rebellion led by Pedro Pablo Atusparia in Huaraz. As a direct response to Prefect Noriega's iniquitous designs on labour and taxation, Atusparia mediated a wave of Indian discontent at exploitation. Atusparia's supporters would appropriate their militancy as affirming their status as true citizens, seeking to unhinge a system that neglected the reciprocity intrinsic to fiscal convention. This incident would inspire numerous subsequent examples, inciting revolt within localities such as Ilave, Huanta, Azangaro, and Puno. Though they had participated in national and local armies in defence of the patria, Indian men remained subordinated as the nation strove to rebuild, a marginalisation that fuelled the persistence of guerrilla activity and propensity to rebel. These groups, in demonstrating a confrontational response to external ruling forces, regenerated an established tradition of questioning state legitimacy. Thurner, From Two Republics to One Divided. P.8 Basadre, Historia de la Republica del Peru. Volume IX. P.5/8 Larson, Andean Highland Peasants. P.69 While indigenous appreciation of the nation grew markedly as a consequence of the war, the resultant mobilisation elucidated the continuance of creole problems with the interior. Motivated by fears intensified by developments across the sierra, the elite would respond with greater efforts at subjugation. Reinvigorated by an emergent positivism and racist biological strands, Peru's prevailing liberal discourse reaffirmed the ideology of enlightened government and elite dominance. With the Indian more concretely transformed into a racial 'other', the cultural and political void between coast and sierra was both redefined and reconfirmed. While much of the country's disparate populace might more clearly project an idea of citizenship at the century's end, the authorities would be apt to counter challenges to political authority, revitalising the assault on the Indian geographical and psychological landscape. Mendez G., 'Incas Si, Indios No.' P.18 In conclusion, nineteenth century Indian conceptions of the nation developed considerably as Peru established itself after independence. The bulk of the population would remain scattered across a diverse geographical landscape, but state alterations to tribute and taxation systems, the erosion of communal property rights, and participation in a war with a foreign power all contributed to heighten Indian acknowledgement of the nation state. The general trend towards a liberal republican direction would nonetheless prove at odds with the indigenous population's desire to maintain their traditional communities, and the gulf between the government's modernising rhetoric and conservative use of the varayoc system inspired significant periods of instability. In challenging financial mismanagement and abuse of power on a local level, Indian groups manifested an established political consciousness and general distaste for the state's failure to keep its side of the bargain. This did not necessarily equate to a national consciousness however, and it was not until their defence of the patria during the War of the Pacific that Andean communities would begin to more concretely perceive their position within a broader nation. Chilean destruction of local communities advanced notions of a common cause and bridged regional divisions, but such notions did not automatically evolve into patriotism and regard for state power. With the government looking to refill its coffers after the war, much of the central Peruvian highlands descended into revolt. In light of a wartime conscription demands, this action highlighted the peasantry's disdain for the government's renewed emphasis on taxation and oppression, and the direction the nation was taking. Though maintenance of an exploitative model had facilitated elite control of a peasant mass in preliminary years, it ultimately inhibited commitment to the country's liberal trajectory, leading intellectuals to once again examine the 'Indian problem' retarding modern development. While the elite would return its attention to the unruly indigenous majority, Indians themselves appeared at odds with the position imposed upon them, rejecting its assault on their prosperity and rights.""","""Indigenous Identity and National Integration""","4909","""Indigenous identity holds a profound significance in the tapestry of national integration, encompassing historical context, cultural preservation, socio-political dynamics, and the quest for equality and recognition. The essence of Indigenous identity often lies in the interwoven threads of ancestral heritage, traditions, language, spirituality, and a deep connection to the land. Throughout history, Indigenous communities worldwide have faced colonization, marginalization, and systematic erasure of their cultures and identities. Despite these challenges, Indigenous peoples have persistently strived to uphold their distinct identities, fostering resilience and resistance in the face of adversity.  In many nations, the question of Indigenous identity plays a pivotal role in the broader discourse of national integration. The recognition of Indigenous rights, land claims, self-governance, and cultural revitalization are central aspects of fostering a more inclusive and equitable society. Acknowledging and respecting the unique identities of Indigenous peoples is crucial for building bridges between different cultural groups and achieving a more cohesive and harmonious society.  One of the fundamental pillars of Indigenous identity is the connection to ancestral lands. For many Indigenous communities, the land is not merely a physical space but a sacred entity deeply intertwined with cultural practices, stories, and spirituality. The preservation of traditional lands is essential for sustaining Indigenous identities and ways of life, as they provide a sense of belonging, continuity, and cultural resilience. Land rights and territorial autonomy are thus integral components of Indigenous struggles for self-determination and cultural survival.  Language also plays a pivotal role in shaping Indigenous identity. Many Indigenous languages are endangered due to factors such as colonization, forced assimilation, and modernization. Language revitalization efforts are crucial for preserving cultural heritage, transmitting traditional knowledge, and fostering a sense of community among Indigenous peoples. Reviving and reclaiming Indigenous languages is not only a means of preserving identity but also a form of resistance against cultural erasure and domination.  Cultural practices and traditions form another cornerstone of Indigenous identity. From art, music, and dance to storytelling, ceremonies, and customary laws, these cultural elements reflect the unique values, beliefs, and worldviews of Indigenous communities. Preserving and promoting these traditions are vital for ensuring the continuity of Indigenous identities and fostering intergenerational transmission of cultural knowledge. Furthermore, embracing and celebrating Indigenous cultures can enrich society as a whole, promoting diversity, mutual respect, and intercultural understanding.  Spirituality is often at the core of Indigenous identity, providing a holistic worldview that emphasizes interconnectedness with the natural world, ancestors, and future generations. Many Indigenous belief systems are deeply rooted in the land, sacred sites, and traditional practices that sustain spiritual connections and cultural expressions. Protecting sacred lands, rituals, and spiritual practices is essential for safeguarding the integrity of Indigenous identities and promoting cultural diversity within society.  In the realm of socio-political dynamics, the recognition of Indigenous rights and self-determination is pivotal for empowering Indigenous communities and promoting social justice. Indigenous peoples have historically faced discrimination, marginalization, and systemic injustices that have undermined their identities and hindered their socio-economic development. Through advocacy, activism, and policy reforms, Indigenous communities have been striving to assert their rights, reclaim their cultural identities, and challenge structures of power that perpetuate inequality and oppression.  National integration requires a commitment to acknowledging historical injustices and addressing the legacy of colonialism that has impacted Indigenous communities. Reconciliation efforts, truth and reconciliation commissions, and collaborative partnerships between Indigenous peoples and state institutions are essential for healing past wounds, fostering mutual understanding, and building inclusive societies based on respect and equality. Recognizing the rights of Indigenous peoples to self-governance, land stewardship, and cultural autonomy is crucial for advancing national integration and embracing the richness of diverse cultural identities within a country.  In conclusion, Indigenous identity is a multifaceted tapestry woven from the threads of history, culture, spirituality, and resilience. The recognition and celebration of Indigenous identities are fundamental to promoting national integration, social cohesion, and cultural diversity within societies. Upholding the rights and autonomy of Indigenous peoples, preserving their languages, traditions, and lands, and fostering mutual respect and understanding are key principles for building a more inclusive and equitable society that honors the richness and complexity of Indigenous identities. By embracing the richness of Indigenous cultures and histories, nations can move towards a more harmonious and interconnected future where all voices are valued, and all identities are respected.""","873"
"6174",""". Brief background to study:In order to determine how words are stored and retrieved from within the mind psycholinguists have undertaken many experiments in an attempt to establish how closely connected words are. Aitchinson suggests that words are related to each other in the form of 'a multi-dimensional cobweb in which every item is attached to scores of others'. Early research concentrated on meaning networks and 'finding out the strength of a link between one particular word and another', suggesting that links between words were formed by 'habits'. When certain words were frequently associated with each other they were thought to 'develop strong ties'. A way to test these theories was through 'word-association tests'. In these experiments subjects are asked to respond with the first word that comes into their head when faced with certain stimuli. Moss describes the motivation behind these studies as the belief that 'word associations provide a direct window onto the underlying structure of semantic memory'. Emphasis was placed not on the individual but in the general responses for large groups. Results showed that different people generally gave rather similar results. Aithcinson noted that 'the consistency of the results suggested to psychologists that they might therefore be able to draw up a reasonably reliable 'map' of the average person's 'word-web'. I will be conducting the same experiment to see which relationships are most frequent among my subjects. I will then assess how reliable this experiment is in determining which words are connected in the lexicons of my subjects.. Description of project:I chose a mixture of nouns, adjectives and verbs as my stimuli. In each word class I chose a selection of frequencies, i.e. high and lower frequencies. For example; 'hair' and 'love' had a similar high frequency, and 'sing' and 'bread' had a similar lower frequency. This ensured that all subjects would have a similar familiarity with the selection of nouns, verbs and adjectives. It also ensured that the experiment took into account that the words we encounter vary in frequency. In order to assess if we map all words in a certain way it is important to look at whether specific relationships are more common in a variety of types of words. For example: do people respond with coordinates for the majority of their answers despite the frequency of the word. I will therefore be look at the relationships between the words compared to the stimulus. I will also be looking to see if there are any significant differences between the younger and older participants. I chose two 0 year old females, and two 0 years old adults, one male, one female.. ResultsResults continued. A pie chart showing the most frequent relationships between the stimuli and the participants responses. Responding with a matching word. Analysis and discussion of results:The results showed that certain relationships were more common than others. In particular was the selection of an antonym. All subjects, despite their age, selected the same word for a variety of the stimuli. For example, 'new-old', 'big-small'. The subjects also tended to pick items if they were part of a pair, therefore coordinates and collocates were common. Interestingly one of the words I chose caused problems for all of the subjects. I chose the word 'chips'. If one has selected the word 'fish' I would have expected one of the most common responses to be 'chips' (Moss 996:9). However when I presented the subjects with the second half of a pair it elicited a confused or different response. The subjects delayed their answer on this stimulus or came up with semantically unrelated words. One subject picked 'daddy', this I presume relates to an advertising campaign which involved the question 'daddy or chips'. One of the subjects selected the word 'chops'. This I can only presume relates to the rhythmic relationship between certain words, for example 'hip-hop' and 'flip-flop', it is also possible that a slip of the tongue meant the subject was intending to say 'chip-shop'. As the word 'chips' was pluralized it may have caused problems among the subjects. This could suggest that words with inflections may be treated differently within the lexicon. However it could also be that because 'chips' is so often linked to 'fish' it is difficult when they are separated, as you may be expecting a word to precede it. Aitchinson suggests that in language there are 'numerous 'freezes', (whereby) pairs of words which have been frozen into a fixed order'.. Some of the words I chose were more flexible, 'chips' perhaps was more restrictive thus problematic to the participants. Field suggests that 'adults tend to choose a word in the same word class as the stimulus'. It was evident from my results that the majority of subjects responded to the stimuli with words from the same word class. This was particularly evident when it came to adjectives. 1.% of adjectives were responded to with another adjective. 7.% of the nouns were responded to with another noun. The statistic for verbs was slightly less, 7.%. This may be because people often associate an action with an object, for example: read and book. However the majority of the time subjects did respond with a word in the same word class.. Age differences:One of the aims of the experiment was to see if there were any differences between the older and younger participants, in terms of their responses. However as my experiment was only on a small scale it makes it difficult to make generalizations about any significant age differences among the participants. In general the responses were similar, however in one instance a response could be described as an indication of the age of the participant. When presented with the word 'hair', a participant responded with 'loss'. This would be more likely to be expressed by someone older; this could also be an indication of gender as hair loss is more common in males. However it is important to note that the other responses to this word gave no indication of age, thus it cannot be assumed that these demographic features affect the association of words. The main difference I noted between to two age groups was the time it took to respond to the stimuli. The older participants took slightly longer to give me their answers. This is concurrent with the research of Cramer who found that older subjects had 'longer associative reaction times than younger adults'. However I cannot describe my results as conclusive as I only had a comparison of older adults to younger adults there is not enough evidence to suggest that older adults take longer to respond.. Conclusions- The word-association test is useful in that it shows that humans tend to generate similar results, Moss also states that the test is useful as 'a simple measure of relatedness between two words', however the results produced are not very conclusive about how words are stored within the mind as a whole. Aitchinson suggests the main problem with word association tests is that 'they cannot tell us about the probable structure of the human word-web'. She identifies the fact that as participants are only required to give one response this cannot 'fully reflect the variety of semantic links that would presumably exist in their semantic memory' (cited in Moss 996:). When participants are asked to give the first word that comes into their head there is a slight delay between what the person thinks and what they actually say. Before the participants give their answer they are making a quick decision as to what word they wish to choose. De Groot found that even when asking participants to respond quickly they take about one and half seconds to respond. This shows there may be a decision making process occurring before responses are given. Aitchinson also notes that the responses are also multifarious. The top responses for most words are semantically similar but some connections are stronger than others. Aitchinson gives the example of butter which is linked to bread, yellow, soft, cream, eggs, milk, cheese. Bread is linked to butter as you eat the two together, whereas yellow and soft describe butter itself. Cream, eggs, milk and cheese are other kinds of dairy food. Therefore although the most people tend to respond in the same way the answers do not help us to determine how words are linked within the lexicon. The test in itself is considered to be unnatural due to the fact that the words are presented on their own. Normal speech would involve the stimuli being surrounded by other words therefore the process of retrieval would no doubt be different. Equally the surrounding words can have an effect on the meaning, Aithcinson concludes that 'if a word's associations can be changed so easily by the context then it is possibly wrong to assume that we can ever lay down fixed and detailed pathways linking words in the mental lexicon'. This I suspect would be the case with one of the some of the stimuli that I chose, particularly 'chips'. If this word occurred in a sentence, or in a different order, it may well have elicited more expected connotations. It is evident through my results that there are definite commonalities among participants. Moss argues that this is often because certain words are more commonly linked, for example 'cat and dog'. Aitchinson also notes that 'two types of link seem to be particularly strong: connections between coordinates and collocation links'. This was true with my results although antonyms featured highly. Although it is undeniable that there are patterns in the responses of participants it is important to note that these findings merely help to provide 'a general framework' (Aitchinson, 003:01) of how words are linked within the lexicon. Perhaps more useful is the technique of priming which looks at how closely words are associated within the lexicon. Priming measures how quickly participants notice words which are/are not associated with the sentence. Field uses the example 'We saw a camel at the zoo. fosk - bank - lidge - hump'. The participant has to press a button every time they see an actual word. The reaction time to 'hump' will be quicker than 'bank' because it has already been triggered by the semantically related 'camel'. This test is more useful than word association as it looks at how closely words are associated before activation occurs and also how long the activation lasts. This gives a deeper insight than previous word-association experiments.""","""Word association and semantic memory""","2079","""Word association and semantic memory play crucial roles in understanding human cognition and how our minds process language and meaning. Let's delve into these fascinating cognitive processes that shape how we perceive and interact with the world around us.  Semantic memory is a form of long-term memory that stores general knowledge about the world, concepts, and language. It serves as a vast repository of information that we use to understand the meanings of words, objects, and ideas. Unlike episodic memory, which records specific events or experiences, semantic memory aids in our ability to recognize, categorize, and recall information based on its meaning.  One of the fundamental components of semantic memory is word association, the process of linking words together based on their semantic relationships. When we hear a word, our minds often automatically generate related words or concepts associated with it. This phenomenon reflects how our brains organize information and make connections between different pieces of knowledge.  Word association tasks are commonly used in psychological research to explore how individuals connect words based on meaning. In these tasks, participants are presented with a stimulus word and are asked to respond with the first word that comes to mind. These responses provide valuable insights into the structure of our semantic networks and how concepts are interconnected in our minds.  Semantic memory is thought to be organized in a hierarchical fashion, with more general concepts at the top and more specific details at lower levels. This hierarchical structure allows us to efficiently store and retrieve information by categorizing related concepts together. For example, within the animal category, we may have subcategories like mammals, birds, reptiles, and so on, each containing specific examples such as dogs, cats, eagles, and snakes.  Word association can also be influenced by various factors, including personal experiences, cultural background, and individual differences. For instance, individuals with similar backgrounds or expertise may show stronger associations between words related to their shared knowledge domain. Cultural factors can also shape word associations, as certain words may be more strongly linked in one culture compared to another.  Moreover, semantic memory plays a crucial role in our language comprehension and production. When we read or listen to language, our brains draw upon semantic memory to interpret the meanings of words, sentences, and texts. Similarly, when we speak or write, we rely on our semantic memory to select the appropriate words and convey our intended message effectively.  Semantic memory is not only essential for language processing but also underpins various cognitive functions such as problem-solving, decision-making, and reasoning. By drawing on our stored knowledge of concepts and relationships, we can navigate the complexities of the world and make informed judgments in different situations.  Furthermore, semantic memory is not a static storage system but is constantly being updated and refined through new experiences and learning. As we encounter new information and acquire new knowledge, our semantic networks adapt and expand to accommodate these changes. This neuroplasticity of semantic memory highlights the brain's remarkable ability to reorganize and reconfigure its cognitive structures over time.  In the domain of word association, research has shown that practice and exposure to related words can strengthen the connections between concepts and improve our performance on word association tasks. This phenomenon, known as priming, demonstrates how repeated exposure to certain stimuli can influence our cognitive processes and facilitate faster retrieval of associated information.  Additionally, disorders affecting semantic memory, such as semantic dementia, can have profound impacts on an individual's ability to understand language and store general knowledge. In semantic dementia, the gradual loss of conceptual knowledge leads to difficulties in word comprehension, object recognition, and semantic relationships. Understanding these cognitive impairments can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying semantic memory and its role in language processing.  In conclusion, word association and semantic memory are integral components of human cognition that shape how we perceive, interpret, and communicate information. By exploring the intricate connections between words and concepts in our semantic networks, we gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie language processing and knowledge representation. Through continued research and investigation, we can uncover the mysteries of semantic memory and elucidate its profound impact on our daily lives.""","805"
"40","""In the thirteenth century there was undoubtedly an immeasurable increase in commercial activity. Trade with the East flourished and as did that within Europe. This was brought about with such developments as the establishment of a banking system with a fundamentally different and adequate system of book keeping and re-development of the infrastructure necessary for vast amounts of goods to travel through Europe. There is much evidence, although not quantitive, such as the increased social status of the merchant and banker and the rapidly expanding nature of commercial ports and towns such as Venice. However, the extent to which this all occurred in the thirteenth century alone is questionable. Many of the roots for such an explosion of trade lay in earlier centuries, for example by 200 many Italian bankers had extended their role from money changers, entering the field of banking proper. To be a revolution it is necessary for there to be 'a great upheaval' or 'a complete change', it will be illustrated that this did not occur in the thirteenth century alone. Chambers Dictionary, p1413 There had always been a certain volume of trade in Europe. This was heavily reduced however during the period of invasion in the ninth and tenth centuries and was restricted mainly to luxury and religious goods. In the late tenth and early eleventh centuries the volume and range of goods that entered Europe began to increase. This first occurred in Italy and gradually spread to Northern Europe. It was a revival, not a new creation, but one with considerable differences. In the twelfth century there was a fundamental change in the balance of trade. Previously Europe had little that the Byzantine and Middle Eastern merchants wanted, so European traders acquired oriental and other such goods through the trade of slaves and mainly bullion. This trade of bullion had led to a vastly diminishing stock of gold and it was not until the later Middle Ages that Europe began to produce goods such as cloth, tin and pewter, with which Europe could trade, halting this bullion decline. There are very few statistics surviving to give an idea of the changing volume and type of European exports in the eleventh and twelfth centuries but there is little doubt that it did increase. The growth of port cities, dependent on sea borne trade, is however useful evidence. Amalfi, a pre eminent port of the eleventh century, was replaced by the larger port of Pisa, which was then immeasurably superseded by the more important ports of Venice and Genoa. This vast increase in the size of port towns shows a growth in wealth and attraction for workers and merchants all as a result of the increasing sea borne trade that entered Italy from the East and was then traded throughout the rest of Europe. However, it was not in the thirteenth century that there was this sudden boom in trade. As early as 29 the Will of the Venetian Doge Justinian Partecipazio mentioned among his assets a substantial in overseas commercial ventures. Venice was then practically independent, but honoured her allegiance to Byzantium by supplying naval assistance, and used her eastern connections to unlock the gates of the Western Empire. She also maintained with Muslim Africa and the Levant as good relations. Thus she gradually built up a thriving triangular trade, based on the trade of eastern luxury goods and western heavy commodities. Moreover, the Venetians had two important commodities of their own: the salt of their lagoons and the glass of their furnaces. By the tenth century some glass blowers had made their way into the upper class, thus acquiring the unusual title of master craftsmen. The commercialisation process, of Venice in particular, had already begun in certain areas as early as the ninth century, indicating a gradual build up to the explosion of the thirteenth century and not revolution. An Economic History of Medieval Europe, p97 An Economic History of Medieval Europe, p98 - 9 The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages, 5/80 - 35/80, p63 The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages, 5/80 - 35/80, p63 While the evidence on European exports is scarce, that for internal trade is non existent. It is through indirect means - the establishment of fairs and markets, the growth and prosperity of mainland towns in which commerce played a significant role, in other words the development of an infrastructure of commerce - that one becomes conscious of the vast expansion of trade within Europe. Land transport, even more expensive than that by sea, found huge limitations in the conditions of the roads. The huge road network of the Roman Empire had fallen into disrepair, with a lack of a coherent organisation and maintenance plan. What was left of trade within Europe relied primarily of internal waterways. However, slowly a new more flexible and complex, but flimsier road network began to take shape. Towns were linked to one another not by one single highway but by several winding trails of beaten earth and loose stones, sometimes bolstered by wooden planks. Although there were limitations to the reliability of this new road network, it provided better links between towns, bringing Europe closer together. In this way trade way able to flourish not only with foreign countries but within Europe, on a scale unknown since the fall of the Roman Empire. However, the programme of road building was not centrally co-ordinated and therefore sporadic, leading to a gradual build up of both the road network and thus trade along such routes. In the ninth and tenth centuries there were no more than 000 towns in Europe that began to be linked by such road networks, half of which were in Italy. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries this vastly increased to at least 000, possibly nearer 000. Some were still agrarian, but around 000 were important places of local and regional trade and where craftsmen made goods for the local market. Most towns were founded in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, suggesting a powerful urge to establish new settlements, therefore showing how strong the conviction was that trade was expanding. Not only were there many new towns, but many of the existing ones saw great expansion. The evidence consists principally in the extension of walls to enclose more extensive areas, but also the establishment of churches and urban parishes outside confines of the town walls. The towns of Europe, especially Italy, had broken free of the agrarian confines of the so called Dark Ages. The great landowners deserted the towns to their castle or manorial retreats, leaving behind a fairly large number of minor noble families, who owned land in the vicinity and lived in the town. However, their weight no longer offset that of the majority of people engaged in trade and crafts. Virtually all of the inhabitants were freemen, and took some part, albeit it very limited, in the municipal assemblies and lower administrative tasks. Merchants as early as 5/80 were able to serve in the military on an equal footing with landowners of equivalent income. These unique political and social circumstances enabled the Italian towns to react to the stimulus of demographic change and agrarian revival more promptly that did the rest of Europe. As early as the tenth century, the opposition between those who fight or pray and those who work was not as significant as the solidarity of townsmen versus men of the country. The embryonic town organisations that embraced craftsmen and merchants were at first generalised due to a limited number of the afore mentioned. Gradually larger and all embracing guilds gave way to those that were more specialised. This demonstrated a substantial increase in the numbers of merchants and craftsmen and the specialisation the latter achieved. An Economic History of Medieval Europe, p99 The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages, 5/80 - 35/80, p67 The increasing number of merchants went hand in hand with a rise in their status showing how important commercial activity was in the tenth to thirteenth centuries. Substantial shifts in the political status and social posture of the merchant class were evident in its top brackets if not in the lower ranks. Despite their influence in the Greco-Roman period merchants were never able to obtain the power and stature of the landed classes. They were at best second class citizens and the middle ages compounded their demise by reducing their numbers. However, in this period of the so called Dark Ages the remaining merchant class sharpened their wits, their organisation and aggressiveness. The entrepreneurs who emerged from this commercially stagnant period 'cared less for recognition than for autonomy, less for security than for opportunity'. They were perfectly adjusted for the warlike, disconnected society of their time. Their goal was to become masters of their own cities and make themselves the hub of territorial states where agriculture would be subservient to trade. At no other time has there been as many governments by and for the merchants, illustrating once again the great importance and rise of commercialism. The Cambridge Economic History of Europe, p331 Along with the rise of the merchant class was the equally important establishment of banks and social weighting of the bankers themselves. The first references to banking are found in the Genoese records of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The acts of the Genoese notaries reveal that the so-called bankers, who were previously merely money changers, had by 200 already extended their activities beyond this role, entering the field of banking. In certain Italian cities, notably Genoa, money changers were now accepting deposits repayable on demand, transferred payments by order of their clients and granted them advances on their current accounts. From the last years of the twelfth century they began to arrange settlements, not only between their own clients, but between those of different banks. In the process of making themselves into genuine bankers, they started up the great companies which brought wealth to their towns of origin and were one of the motive forces behind big business in the thirteenth century. A network of agents was established and correspondents between their towns of origin, the fairs of Champagne and certain large centres of trade. The activity and profits of the Italian banking houses were founded on the use of the bill of exchange. This simple, but highly flexibly instrument allowed vast sums of money to be moved from one account to another, from one part of Europe to another in as short a time as it took for a courier to make the journey between them. Money could be paid into a bank in Florence and paid out at a branch in Champagne where the merchant could buy his goods, without having to carry the money. This was a key development therefore and without it the increase in commercial activity would arguably not have been possible on such a scale. Merchants no longer had to risk carrying vast amounts of bullion around with them, which slowed them down considerably anyway. However, the fragility of these banks can be seen with the collapse of the three largest, the Florentine companies of the Bardi, the Peruzzi and the Acciajoli. They had triumphed in the first half of the fourteenth century thanks to their perfect organisation, only to collapse as a result of lending vast sums of unsecured money to King Edward III of England on the eve of the Hundred Years' War, counting on a quick and profitable victory. Business, Banking and Economic Thought, p200 Economic Development of Medieval Europe, p146 An Economic History of Medieval Europe, p418 Economic Development of Medieval Europe, p15/81 Just as important as the methods of paying money in and out of banks was the record keeping necessary to keep track of the ever increasing flows of cash this encompassed. The sophisticated manipulations of Italian merchants and bankers called for a no less developed method of keeping their accounts. Such early account books as have survived show a confusing medley of entries relating to purchases and sales, with occasional notes of an entirely private nature. Such methods were quite inadequate for the needs of the Italian banker and who dealt in bills of exchange as well as merchandise from all parts of Europe. In the course of the thirteenth century he learnt to keep his credit and debit entries separate from one another, either on different pages or ledgers. This method was latterly called double entry book keeping and is still used today. Some such as Sombart describe its importance as 'the cornerstone of capitalism'. However, 'it is very doubtful whether merchants 'required anything more from their ledgers and journals than a clear and ready record of transactions for easy reference, and descriptive details of their cash, merchandise, and other assets bought and sold'. Double entry book keeping was a convenience but its introduction clearly had no revolutionary consequences'. An Economic History of Medieval Europe, p427 An Economic History of Medieval Europe, p427 Although the idea of a commercial revolution implies developments in trade and commerce, agricultural changes were also very important. 'As demographic growth was a prime motor of agricultural progress, so agricultural progress was an essential prerequisite the Commercial Revolution'. So long as peasants were only able to ensure their own subsistence and that of their lords, then all other activities were marginalised. When food surpluses increased, due to for example the introduction of the three field rotation system, it became possible for some people to spend more time following other pursuits. Merchants and craftsmen were given the opportunity to provide more than the mere fistful of luxury goods for the extremely wealthy, and it is in this respect that we can see the advances in agriculture leading to a vast increase in commercial activity. The Commercial revolution of the Middle Ages, 5/80 - 35/80, p5/86 The notion of a Commercial Revolution ensues a period of economic depression in the preceding years, known as the Dark Ages. However, the very fact that there were certain periods of economic upturns, although short lived and regional, in which the roots of the explosion of commercialism in the thirteenth century lie, illustrates the limited extent to which the period described can be called a revolution. In the early sixth century the Emperor in the East, Justinian, brought together Roman Law, built a huge church in Constantinople and recaptured Italy from the Goths. He also manages to claim the lands of Southern Spain and Northern Africa and hence there were many economic benefits of this great rule. The most important was that trade could continue between Italy and Constantinople, ensuring the ready supply of money and wealth, but the Lombard invasion of 68 disrupts this. However, Southern France by the late sixth century looks outwards in terms of trade to North Africa and Constantinople. This illustrated that cities and trade were not dead in the so called Dark Ages. Latterly the Charlemagne Empire that covered France, Germany and Italy, had many economic benefits mainly in terms of trade. From Italy came wine and from the North came cloth and fur to name a few. This cannot be overly exaggerated, but it does show signs of economic activity, building up towards the thirteenth century in which there was unquestionably a great increase in commerce. The problem is whether all this change actually occurred in the thirteenth century alone and had such a profound difference to be called a revolution. There was a significant increase in external trade, but the roots lie in the expansion of the late tenth and early eleventh centuries, culminating in the fundamental change in the twelfth century when Europe began producing goods that it could trade with the East instead of trading bullion. The vast improvements to the infrastructure enabled internal trade to expand with the establishment of fairs and markets and the growth of mainland commercial towns. But the expansion of many of these towns and the new ones created occurred in the late twelfth century, continued in the thirteenth century. There was a rise of the merchant and banking classes, but as early as 5/80 they were able to serve in the military forces on an equal footing with landowners and the root of their sharp nature came out of the periods of depression of the Dark Ages. It has been argued by Pounds that even the establishment of the banking system that is seen to be synonymous with Commercial Revolution was a convenience and not revolutionary. Hence, there clearly was a significant expansion of trade and commerce in the thirteenth century, but the extent with which this can be called a revolution is very limited, with much of its roots lying in early centuries.""","""Commercial Activity in the Middle Ages""","3292","""Commercial activity in the Middle Ages played a significant role in shaping the economic landscape of Europe during this period. From the decline of the Roman Empire to the emergence of the Renaissance, medieval commerce evolved in response to changing social, political, and technological conditions. This era witnessed the growth of trade networks, the development of urban centers, and the rise of merchant class, all of which contributed to the expansion of commercial activities across regions. Understanding the dynamics of commercial activity in the Middle Ages provides valuable insights into the foundations of modern commerce and trade practices.  At the outset of the Middle Ages, the fall of the Western Roman Empire around 476 AD resulted in the disruption of established trade routes and the decline of long-distance commerce. The subsequent decentralization of political power and the rise of feudalism led to a shift towards localized economies based on agriculture and self-sufficiency. However, as stability improved over time, trade gradually began to resurface, spurred by the need for goods beyond the local production capabilities.  One of the key factors that fueled commercial activity during the Middle Ages was the revival of long-distance trade networks. The re-establishment of trade routes, such as the Silk Road connecting Europe to the East, facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and technologies across regions. Merchants from cities like Venice, Genoa, and Constantinople played crucial roles in bridging the gap between different cultures and facilitating trade between East and West.  The growth of medieval cities also played a pivotal role in driving commercial activity. Urban centers such as Florence, Bruges, and London emerged as hubs of trade and commerce, attracting merchants, craftsmen, and artisans. The establishment of marketplaces, guilds, and fairs provided platforms for buying and selling a wide range of goods, fostering economic growth and urban development. The city of Venice, in particular, became a powerhouse of maritime trade, dominating Mediterranean commerce through its strategic location and naval power.  The medieval period also witnessed the rise of the merchant class, which played a crucial role in shaping commercial activities. Merchants, often organized into guilds, formed networks that extended beyond local borders, engaging in long-distance trade and financial transactions. Their expertise in assessing risks, negotiating deals, and navigating diverse cultural landscapes was instrumental in expanding trade routes and fostering economic prosperity.  In addition to physical goods, the Middle Ages saw the flourishing of financial instruments and banking practices that supported commercial activities. The development of bills of exchange, partnerships, and early forms of banking paved the way for more sophisticated financial systems that facilitated cashless transactions and credit arrangements. The emergence of banking families like the Medici in Italy and the Fuggers in Germany exemplified the growing influence of financial intermediaries in medieval commerce.  The Church also played a significant role in regulating commercial activities through the imposition of laws and regulations. The canon law of the Catholic Church influenced trade practices, business ethics, and the concept of fair pricing. The Church's endorsement of usury (charging interest on loans) varied over time, impacting the evolution of financial practices and lending norms in medieval Europe.  Technological advancements also contributed to the growth of commercial activities during the Middle Ages. Innovations such as the compass, the astrolabe, and improved ship designs revolutionized maritime navigation, enabling merchants to explore new trade routes and expand their commercial networks. The advent of the printing press in the mid-15th century further facilitated the dissemination of information, contracts, and records, streamlining business operations and enhancing communication within the commercial sector.  Despite the progress in commercial activities, challenges such as political instability, warfare, and the outbreak of diseases like the Black Death presented obstacles to trade and economic growth. Periodic conflicts between city-states, kingdoms, and empires disrupted trade routes and impeded the flow of goods and services. The devastating impact of the Black Death in the mid-14th century had widespread repercussions on the economy, leading to labor shortages, inflation, and social unrest that affected commercial activities across Europe.  In conclusion, commercial activity in the Middle Ages was a dynamic and multifaceted phenomenon that transformed the economic landscape of Europe. The revival of trade networks, the growth of urban centers, the emergence of the merchant class, and the development of financial systems all contributed to the expansion of commerce during this period. By navigating economic challenges, harnessing technological innovations, and overcoming regulatory barriers, medieval merchants paved the way for the globalized economy and interconnected commercial networks that characterize the modern world. The legacy of medieval commerce continues to resonate in contemporary trade practices, emphasizing the enduring impact of historical developments on the evolution of commercial activities.""","918"
"6165",""".The power produced by a wind turbine is dependant upon several things: the wind speed incident on the turbine, the turbine characteristics, and the load on the turbine. The efficiency of the turbine at extracting power from the wind can be described in terms of a coefficient of performance, C p; a dimensionless number. The value of Cp of the turbine will vary with wind speed, but it is better to compare it to another dimensionless number,, tip speed ratio. A graph of Cp against will show the performance of a wind turbine at a range of wind speeds. P w is the power extracted from the is the rate of turbine Q is the torque exerted by the rotor;, R and V as before. C q is equivalent to C p divided by. The objective of the experiment is to investigate the characteristics of a small wind turbine at different wind speeds and for varying electrical the generator.. MethodologyA Rutland Wind Charger was positioned in the exhaust flow from a wind tunnel, and connected to a circuit containing variable resistors. An ammeter was connected into the circuit, and a voltmeter across the resistors. Measurements of current, P is the pressure difference as recorded by the manometer connected to the pitot give a representation of the C p- curve of the turbine. Since torque coefficient is equivalent experiment is set up so that several measurements of I and can be made by varying the resistance and so the voltage across the circuit at a certain wind speed. The wind speed is also altered several times, and a set of current and rotational speed readings taken at each different wind speed. In this way, graphs equivalent to C q- curves can be made for each wind generator characteristic for the turbine can be obtained by plotting I against for each different voltage set, which gives an indication of how the generator responds to changing wind speeds at different loads.. ResultsAppendix contains tables of the data recorded. The wind tunnel is designed for experiments to be performed within the square working section, however the wind turbine was too large to fit within the pitot tube pressure difference. The wind speed at the centre of the rotor increases linearly with the wind speed inside the wind tunnel, and so the wind tunnel pressure differences p, measured by the pitot tube, correspond to increasing wind speed very well for qualitative analysis. Figures, and show the Cp- curve, generator characteristic, and torque coefficient obtained for the Rutland Windcharger turbine.. DiscussionThe optical tachometer required positioning behind the turbine to obtain results. The tachometer was handheld, and so there will have been some influencing of the air-stream near the turbine by the tachometer operator. Figure shows that wind speed across the rotor cross section varies by quite a large amount. The two sets of data for the two different wind speeds both show the same sort of decrease in wind speed towards the edge of the rotor disk. The bottom of the rotor appears to experience the greatest decrease in wind speed from the central value, while the top has the smallest decrease. The left and right hand sides of the rotor both experience decreases in wind speed. The reason for the different wind speeds at different locations is likely to be due to changes in the air flow as it exits the wind tunnel. At room air temperatures and pressures, air flow is very turbulent, and so turbulent entrainment of ambient air from outside the wind tunnel exit region is likely to slow the outer regions of the air flow. The continuity equation, , shows how the wind speed at the tunnel exit will be lower then the speed within the tunnel. Past the tunnel exit, turbulence, entrainment, and further expansion of the stream tube of the air flow will further slow the air. values from table and tunnel wind speeds as used in figure: This is an interesting result, as the recorded wind speeds at the turbine are higher than these calculated values of wind speed at the tunnel exit. It could be that there is some error, either in the measurements of P or wind speed at the turbine. A polynomial regression line of fourth order fitted to the curve in figure gives an equation: C p = 10 - 4 - 10 - 3 10 - 2 -.012.131, similar in form to other C p approximations for other wind graph shows how C p peaks for a certain value of tip speed ratio: this is the Betz limit, a physical constraint which is a consequence of the balance of forces which must occur as the wind stream acts upon the turbine. The exact shape and peak of the C p curve depends upon the free stream wind speed, and the characteristics of the turbine itself. The maximum value of C p that can occur is.9. Since we have used an equivalent to C to smaller currents in the circuit for the same rotational rate, following Ohm's Law: E=IR, where R is the circuit resistance. This can be looked at alternatively; higher loads at the same wind speed lead to a decrease in current but an increase in rotational rate. For a higher voltage across the resistors, a higher rotation rate is needed to produce the same current. For a constant load, increasing wind speed means increasing rotational rate and so increasing current. For a constant wind speed, increasing load means a decrease in current and increase in rotational rate: the faster the turbine must turn in order to provide the required voltage/current. Figure shows that higher wind higher rotation rates of the turbine, and higher currents produced in the circuit, however the relationship between current and rotational speed is not linear for changing loads at the same wind speed. As the load in the circuit is increased (voltage increases), current and rotational speed both increase at first for most of the wind speeds, but as load continues to increase, the current in the circuit drops while rotational speed continues to increase. In order to produce the maximum power, a balance between load and wind speed must be found; the power output is equal to the current times the voltage, but current and voltage are also bound by Ohm's Law. Increasing the circuit resistance causes a decrease in the current for a given voltage, and so an increase in the rotation rate of the turbine. In practice, many wind turbines make use of this fact, and use resistance control to affect wind turbine speed so that the frequency output of the turbine generator remains constant. Resistor control can also be used to ensure that the power output of the turbine is at a maximum for a given wind speed. Figure can be used to compare the measured performance of the turbine with its expected performance, as reported by the turbine manufacturer. The manufacturer provides a curve of charge provided by the turbine into a 2V battery against wind speed. The manufacturer presents results from - 0 ms -, however this experiment only had a range of wind speeds.5/8 - 5/8. ms - (as measured at the turbine), which is equivalent to the straight line portion of the manufacturer's curve. As such, the experimental results match quite well except in terms of magnitude; the maximum current produced by the turbine at about 5/8ms - for 2V is about A from the manufacturer's graph, but only about A from the experiment. However, the manufacturer states that the expected performance curve is for ideal, non-turbulent conditions, which are unlikely to have been achieved in the experiment. The resistive load for charging a 2V battery could also have been smaller than the load imposed in the circuit during the experiment.""","""Wind turbine power performance analysis""","1499","""Wind turbine power performance analysis is a crucial aspect of evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of wind energy systems. By assessing the performance of wind turbines, researchers, engineers, and operators can optimize operations, improve energy production, and reduce maintenance costs. This comprehensive analysis involves monitoring various parameters, conducting tests, and interpreting data to ensure that wind turbines operate at their full potential. In this article, we will delve into the key components of wind turbine power performance analysis and explore its significance in the renewable energy sector.  One of the primary aspects of wind turbine power performance analysis is measuring the actual power output of the turbine. This involves comparing the power generated by the turbine with its rated capacity under specific wind conditions. By analyzing power curves, operators can determine if the turbine is performing as expected or if there are any issues affecting its efficiency. Variations in power output can be indicative of mechanical problems, inadequate wind resources, or suboptimal turbine settings.  Wind speed is another critical parameter that impacts the performance of wind turbines. Anomaly detection and data validation techniques are employed to ensure the accuracy of wind speed measurements. By analyzing wind speed data in conjunction with power output, engineers can assess how well the turbine is capturing available wind energy and generating electricity. Wind shear, turbulence, and other meteorological factors must also be considered to accurately evaluate turbine performance.  Furthermore, analyzing the relationship between wind direction and turbine yaw alignment is essential for optimizing energy production. Yaw misalignment can lead to power losses as the turbine fails to orient itself properly with the incoming wind. Adjusting yaw settings based on wind data and performance analysis can significantly improve the overall energy yield of the turbine.  Additionally, monitoring mechanical components such as bearings, gears, and blades is crucial for identifying potential issues that may affect turbine performance. Vibration analysis, oil analysis, and thermographic inspections are common techniques used to detect abnormalities and prevent costly breakdowns. Regular maintenance based on performance analysis results can extend the lifespan of wind turbines and ensure reliable operation.  Data analytics and software tools play a vital role in wind turbine power performance analysis. SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems collect real-time data on turbine operation, enabling operators to monitor performance metrics and diagnose problems efficiently. Advanced algorithms and predictive maintenance models can leverage this data to forecast potential failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and improve overall turbine performance.  Performance optimization strategies based on data-driven insights are instrumental in maximizing the energy output of wind turbines. Condition monitoring techniques, such as continuous monitoring of key parameters and trend analysis, enable proactive maintenance actions to be taken before minor issues escalate into major problems. By implementing predictive maintenance programs informed by performance analysis, operators can minimize downtime, reduce operational costs, and enhance overall system reliability.  In conclusion, wind turbine power performance analysis is a multifaceted process that encompasses monitoring power output, wind speed, yaw alignment, mechanical components, and data analytics. By conducting thorough performance assessments and leveraging advanced tools and techniques, operators can ensure that wind turbines operate efficiently, produce maximum energy output, and contribute effectively to the renewable energy landscape. Continuous performance monitoring and optimization are essential for achieving sustainable wind power generation and realizing the full potential of wind energy resources.""","633"

Experimental - Method4 different runs of the experiment were carried out sequentially using: Approx vol H O Sulphuric were kept in thermostatted water baths for 5/8 mins for temperature equilibration and mixed vigorously and continuously. 0 drops starch indicator were added to each mixture. H O kept in a separate flask at the required temperature, prior to addition. Sodium added to the iodide/acid mixture, then the H O and a stopclock started. When the starch indicator turned green/blue, the time was noted and.cm thiosulphate added. This was repeated until cm of thiosulphate had been added. The reaction flask was kept to one side for later use. Note: the blue colour was due to iodine complexing with starch; the iodine being formed by H O oxidising I- and so being consumed. The immediate addition of thiosulphate reduced the iodine back to I- rendering the solution colourless again until more H O oxidised I- to reform iodine. Thus the cumulative volume of thiosulphate was inversely proportional to the concentration of H O remaining in the reaction flask. Note: Towards the end of run, the appearance of the blue/green colour was not so sharp, so the individual error in time recorded will be greatest here. By the time all runs had been flask was assumed to have gone to completion and reaction flask heated in a 5/8 oC water bath for 0mins to achieve completion, i.e all H O used up. Reaction flasks & were simultaneously titrated with sodium thiosulphate in.cm portions as before until no blue/green colour appeared for 0minutes. The final thiosulphate titre volume was proportional to the initial concentration of peroxide: t= Experimental - Result and Therefore, H O: S O 2- ratio is:mol. S O 2- used=5/8./0000.9 =.5/810 - Therefore mol. H O in 5/8cm =.5/8310 - =(.5/8310 -)/5/81000 =.101M In the table below: A is equivalent to t=, x is the vol. of S O added c is equivalent to t which is A-x For a plot of c - against time, a straight line would indicate a second order reaction w.r.t to peroxide since for: when integrated. Looking closely at the above graph, the relationship between c - and time is not linear but an upward curve and so the Harcourt-Essen reaction is not nd w.r.t to peroxide. Plotting /time: There is a clear linear correlation corresponding to first order kinetics w.r.t peroxide. Similarly for the runs, and: The gradient of each graph gives k', the pseudo-first order rate constant where k'=k k is calculated in the table below. Note: values for k' calculated in MS Excel to more significant figures than shown in the above graphs. Where: total vol. in each reaction flask = 5/80cm. I- in 5/80cm = Vol KI/.4819 = mol. I- in 5/80cm3 k' is regression coefficient calculate in MS ExcelRun has half the concentration of iodide as Run;both at the same temperature, and k' is almost half, within limits of experimental error. This is consistent with a directly proportional relationship between rate and iodide concentration and so the reaction is also st order w.r.t to iodide. Runs and, at higher temperatures, show faster rates. The empirical rule of an approximate doubling of rate for every 0 oc increase in temperature seems borne out by the values of k for runs and:.8/.1 =.14 The following table sets out the data needed to calculate Arrhenius parameters: Gradient of regression line = -E/R where R=.145/81 JK -mol - Intercept of regression line = lnA Conclusions and DiscussionDuring all runs, the concentration of iodide can be assumed to be constant due to the regular addition of thiosulphate, so reducing the iodine formed back to iodide. Therefore, assuming the rate determining step involves no other species than H O + and I-, the straight line graph of time for all runs, shows st order w.r.t H O the reaction to be st order w.r.t to I- and thus, nd order overall. The mechanism discussed in the introduction is a valid proposal. The difficulty in determining the initial concentration of peroxide will have been a significant source of error for the actual calculation. Reaction flask had been left to stand for hours, and flask for.5/8 hours as well as being heated for 0mins. It was assumed all the peroxide had been used up by then. However, during this 'infinite time' titration, even after periods as long as 0mins, the blue colour would reappear; due to time limits in the laboratory, there had to be a cut-off point. This would not affect the values of the calculated rate constant since the gradient of time will have been the same. The linear regression equation used for calculating the Arrhenius parameters was based on measurements. For a more precise and accurate determination of the collision frequency factor A, and activation energy E, the experiment would need to be repeated at many more temperatures. This would allow for statistically meaningful confidence intervals to be measured for each parameter.""","""Harcourt-Essen reaction kinetics analysis""","1224","""The Harcourt-Essen Reaction Kinetics Analysis has been a significant advancement in the field of chemical kinetics, providing researchers with a powerful tool to study reaction mechanisms and kinetics quantitatively. This analysis method, named after C. D. Harcourt and H. Essen, involves the use of linear free energy relationships (LFER) to gain insights into the rate-determining step of a chemical reaction. By understanding the kinetics of a reaction, scientists can unravel the underlying mechanisms, optimize reaction conditions, design more efficient processes, and predict the behavior of chemical systems accurately. In this article, we will delve into the principles of the Harcourt-Essen Reaction Kinetics Analysis, its applications, and its significance in the realm of chemical kinetics.  At the core of the Harcourt-Essen Reaction Kinetics Analysis lies the concept of linear free energy relationships. These relationships, often expressed as linear equations, correlate changes in reaction rates with changes in fundamental physicochemical parameters such as bond strengths, charge distributions, and steric effects. By establishing these correlations, researchers can infer the impact of structural and electronic factors on the reaction kinetics, allowing for the elucidation of reaction mechanisms and the identification of rate-determining steps.  One of the key advantages of the Harcourt-Essen approach is its ability to provide mechanistic insights without the need for sophisticated computational methods or extensive experimental data. By measuring the kinetics of a reaction under various conditions and analyzing the resulting rate data using LFER, researchers can discern patterns and trends that unveil the intricate details of the underlying chemical processes. This methodology is particularly valuable in cases where direct observation or theoretical calculations of reaction intermediates are challenging, offering a pragmatic and efficient alternative for mechanistic studies.  The Harcourt-Essen Reaction Kinetics Analysis finds widespread applications across diverse areas of chemistry, including organic synthesis, catalysis, biochemistry, and environmental chemistry. In organic synthesis, mechanistic understanding is crucial for designing efficient synthetic routes and controlling selectivity. By employing the Harcourt-Essen approach, chemists can optimize reaction conditions, predict reactivity trends, and troubleshoot problematic transformations with greater confidence and precision.  In the field of catalysis, where the design of catalysts for specific reactions is paramount, the Harcourt-Essen Reaction Kinetics Analysis aids in optimizing catalytic systems by revealing the factors that govern catalytic activity and selectivity. By dissecting the kinetics of catalytic reactions, researchers can tailor catalyst structures, fine-tune reaction conditions, and enhance catalytic performance, leading to more sustainable and economical processes.  Furthermore, in biochemistry and drug discovery, understanding the kinetics of enzymatic reactions is essential for elucidating enzyme mechanisms, designing pharmaceuticals, and predicting drug metabolism. The Harcourt-Essen approach can provide valuable insights into enzyme kinetics, substrate specificity, and inhibition mechanisms, guiding the development of new therapeutic agents and optimizing drug formulations for improved efficacy and safety.  Moreover, in environmental chemistry, the Harcourt-Essen Reaction Kinetics Analysis plays a critical role in studying the fate and transformation of pollutants in the environment. By examining the kinetics of chemical reactions involved in environmental processes such as degradation, sorption, and transport, scientists can assess the environmental impact of contaminants, develop remediation strategies, and monitor environmental quality effectively.  In conclusion, the Harcourt-Essen Reaction Kinetics Analysis stands as a powerful tool for unraveling the mysteries of chemical reactions, offering a systematic and quantitative framework for studying reaction mechanisms and kinetics. By leveraging linear free energy relationships, researchers can decipher the factors governing reaction rates, identify rate-determining steps, and optimize reaction conditions with precision and insight. With its broad applications spanning various branches of chemistry, the Harcourt-Essen approach continues to inspire advancements in research, contribute to the development of new materials and processes, and deepen our understanding of the fundamental principles that govern chemical reactivity.""","781"
"3028","""Evolutionary theory tries to determine genotypic frequencies in populations and change through time, past, present and future. A variety of evolutionary mechanisms and forces have been classified by geneticists that affect the frequency of alternative genotypes in populations from one generation to the next. The most important of these evolutionary processes that also govern our variation are sexual reproduction, natural selection, genetic drift, mutation and recombination. Many ecological and other adaptive pressures also have affects on the exchange of genetic material between populations. All genetic evolutionary theory is based on the principles of Mendelian genetics discovered by the Silesian monk, Gregor Mendel. Mendel using experiments with peas, with differing physical characteristics such skin colour and wrinkled skin discovered the foundational laws of all genetics, based on what would be alleles operating at a single locus on a chromosome. He determined a distinction between genotype and phenotype, the genotype having two alleles or genes, in most cases on being 'dominant' and expressed and the other being 'recessive' hidden. Therefore, possible combinations of genotype could be classified as two homozygous and one heterozygous, further leading to two frequency is calculated by the total number of the particular allele within a determined pool of gametes. Gene frequency is the total number of an individual allele at a particular locus on a chromosome within a determined population possessing the gene. (summation of all gene frequencies for genotypes at a particular locus equals, therefore is not proportionally affected by the size of the population). As long as there are only two alleles at the genetic locus of interest in the gamete pool, gene frequency can also be calculated from collected genotypic information at the locus. After basic calculation the following equation is possible, taken from Boyd and illustrate the quote, consider a genetic disease such as Tay-Sachs which usually kills the individual with the homozygous genotype by the age of four. Every generation that passes, all homozygous individuals with the lethal allele will be removed from the population. Following, two alleles for every homozygous individual will be removed from the affected population, leaving only heterozygous individuals with the allele of interest. Therefore substantially lowering the overall gene frequency within the there were only a few genes at a couple of loci affecting beak size, with no environmental affects such as nourishment affecting growth, a stratified effect would be observed in the collect information of beak dimensions of different individuals. Could be analogous to the way we buy our clothes, 'small, medium or large'. In reality, empirical data shows the majority of expressed characteristics we see as un-stratified, complex gradual continuous variation, with no visible increments amongst data collected. Environment change and variation have large effects on gene frequencies within populations. Using Darwin's finches again as an example, when the climate changed and drought ensued on Daphne Major, the mean relative beak size of the finches increased due to pressures of natural selection to adapt to the change of available food. Larger beaked individuals survived better than small beaked individuals due to the increased size and hardness of nut and seed food source. This therefore increased gene frequencies affecting large beak size and growth. What is theoretically alleles controlling growth hormones, or calcium supply to the beak. Data collected from Daphne Major have shown a positive correlation between beak width and beak depth. Although, this was actually maladaptive. Whatever genotypes were increasing the advantageous trait of beak depth, were also by pleiotropic effect, increasing the beak width at the same time. It turns out selection favoured beak depth, and not beak width. The thinner beak could apply more pressure, than an individual with a wide beak. It therefore follows, as the finches neared selective equilibrium in the environment, the threshold for deletion also included birds with the largest beaks as well as the smallest beaks, altering gene frequencies for large and small beak characteristics. Still one of Darwin's problems remains, selection tends to deplete genetic variation when selection reaches adaptive equilibrium. MutationMutations can slowly add new genetic variation to populations and may produce novel phenotypic affects that selection can assemble into adaptation. But, not all mutations are advantageous, they can also have a deadly affect on the individual, or a neutral undetected affect. Mutations can be caused by certain forms of ionising radiation, such as X rays, and certain kinds of chemicals that damage the DNA and alter the message that it carries. Rates of mutation are very low, Boyd and Silk suggest ranging from in 00000 to in 0 million per locus per gamete in each to Hardy-Weinberg equations, based on the frequency of deleterious recessive genes being about in 000. This low-rate of mutation is sufficient to maintain variation within a population at selective equilibrium, and so solve Darwin's problem of selection tending to deplete selection. When mutation introduces enough new mutations to maintain a constant frequency of the gene, it can be said there is selection-mutation balance. Varying types of events exist in the mutation of somatic cells. Jurmain gives examples of 'frame-shift mutation', in which, during recombination be omitted from the process causing the entire translation of bases into different codons, or amino acids. It is also possible for entire codons that normally contain 'stop' information between genes to be omitted or have the translation changed allowing the joining of genes. Point mutation is a change of a single base at one locus, changing the translation of a single codon, or amino acid. Sickle cell anaemia, is a disease with affects population in tropical regions in which falciparum malaria is prevalent. When the haemoglobin S allele in homozygous in the individual they suffer debilitating anaemia and do not live until adulthood, and so substantial amounts of the allele are removed from each generation. But, it happens in this case that the heterozygous phenotype is actually selected by natural selection, individuals heterozygous with the allele are 5/8% more likely to reach adulthood than individuals homozygous with the standard haemoglobin A allele. This is because of the resistance heterozygous individuals receive against malaria, although their blood cells do not carry oxygen quite as well homozygous haemoglobin A individuals. A balanced polymorphism is reached when heterozygotes have a higher genetic fitness than either homozygote, a steady rate at which both alleles exist in the population. From this, it can easily be understood how an advantageous single point mutation in an individual gene could be selected to reach substantial gene frequencies within the population (maybe within a few occurrences, over many generation to proliferate.). A crossing-over of alleles during the recombination of meiosis can producing novel combinations of traits. Chromosomes are frequently damaged during the process, break and recombine. Such an event can cause a crossing-over of alleles to create genotypes that were not in the parents, and therefore express new phenotypic characteristics. Genetic DriftSometimes known as a random force, operating on small genetically isolated populations. To give a simple example, if we had an genetically and physically isolated Polynesian island population of 0 individuals, and during a storm a tree collapses killing of the most successful, genetically fit individuals within the population. Much potentially advantageous genetic material could be lost. This could potentially have great changes on gene frequencies within the small population. Genetic drift in small populations causes random changes in gene frequencies. Gene frequency can change by chance alone bypassing the operations of natural selection. If a certain locus has roughly equal gene frequencies of two different alleles acting on it, analogy could be pretty much like two people repeatedly flipping a hand full of coins (the population are the individual coins), in turn, guessing if it is heads or tails until one person or the other has won all the coins. And so the individual would be homozygous with one or the other allele. If the two people had thousands of coins to flip between them, the time taken until one person had one them all would take much, much longer, if ever. Such a homozygous state is be called a point of 'fixation'. This process operates far quicker than natural selection on a small isolated population, mostly leading to maladaptation. The population will remain at fixation until mutation introduces a new allele. Jared Diamond gives examples of his experiences in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea probably has the most genetic diversity between populations on the planet. Being roughly the size of France, it has about a third of the earths mutually indistinguishable languages, its isolated inhabitants having been there over 0,00 years. The islands physical boundaries and thick vegetation are notoriously difficult to travel through, one expedition to explore the mountain peaks in the early 0 th century being abandoned after months, only moving about 0 miles inland. There is also very little naturally occurring edible food to further inhibit travel. The inhabited highlands we only discovered in the mid-early part of the 0 th century by a botanist interested in studying the great diversity in birds there. Jared Diamond through his own study and travel has described the phenotypic diversities that exist between the small population groups that exist there, describing some small populations as been inflicted with various genetic diseases, and other equally isolated populations as having unusually late starting age for puberty amongst individuals, for example. Most scientists agree that population sizes must be fairly small, around one hundred individuals for genetic drift to have an important effect when it is opposed to natural selection. It is agreed, genetic drift has more noticeable affects on traits expressed by a genotype at a single locus, it is unlikely genetic drift would generate significant maladaptation in traits that vary continuously and are affected by many genetic loci. Genetic drift can also include the 'founder effect' or 'sewell height'. To give example from Boyd and Silk, the Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch immigrants who arrived in South Africa in the 7 th century. The small group of individuals who were part of the first colonising population carried with them a number of rare genetic diseases. These diseases are preserved within the modern population in high frequencies. For example the disease porphyria variegata, sufferers have an severe adverse reaction to anaesthetics. About 0,00 of the modern population carry the dominant allele for the disease, every on of them being descended from a single couple in the original population of immigrants (003: 48). Concluding RemarksIt is difficult to know where the boundaries are of the processes that do and don't affect gene frequency are. Do you discuss gene flow between isolated populations, species (ecological species concept), in detail? Allopatric speciation? Parapatric and sympatric speciation (although they don't seem to compatible with allopatric speciation)? The further affects of disease, and the environment in the way of adaptation could affect gene frequencies? Hidden variation? It seems processes and relative ideas can easily traverse into topics of environmental adaptation, pathology, and further genetic theory. Apparently, it is often easy to view a species as being in adaptive equilibrium, when equilibrium is not necessarily reached. The environment of the species could have changed in the recent past. Boyd and Silk give the example the Human species. Since the advent of agriculture and subsequent improved social infrastructure, the supply of sugar, fats and salts has been readily available for many humans. Before agriculture and animal husbandry, it was advantageous for the individual to have a behavioural trait to crave, and eat as much sugar, fat and salt as he could find, living on a diet of wild game, grass seeds and other plant foods. In the modern age it seems natural selection has yet to catch up with the technological advances, will still crave these foods, but today they are not always advantageous. They can lead to well known problems including bad teeth, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure.""","""Evolutionary mechanisms and genetic variation""","2427","""Evolutionary mechanisms and genetic variation are fundamental concepts in the field of biology that explain how species change over time and adapt to their environment. These mechanisms, including natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation, drive the diversity of life on Earth. Genetic variation is at the core of evolution, providing the raw material upon which natural selection acts. Understanding these concepts sheds light on the complexity and beauty of the natural world.  Natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, is perhaps the most well-known evolutionary mechanism. It is the process by which organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more successfully. This differential reproductive success leads to the accumulation of advantageous traits in a population over generations. For example, in a population of moths, those with better camouflage are more likely to survive predation and pass on their genes to the next generation. As a result, the frequency of the gene for camouflage increases in the population, illustrating natural selection in action.  Another important evolutionary mechanism is genetic drift, which describes how random chance can cause changes in allele frequencies in a population. Genetic drift is most pronounced in small populations where chance events can have a significant impact on the gene pool. Unlike natural selection, genetic drift is a random process that can lead to the loss of genetic variation within a population. An example of genetic drift is the founder effect, where a small group of individuals establishes a new population, resulting in a loss of genetic diversity compared to the original population.  Gene flow, or the transfer of genes between populations, is another mechanism that influences genetic variation. This can occur through migration of individuals or the movement of gametes between populations. Gene flow can introduce new genetic variations into a population or homogenize gene frequencies between populations. For instance, pollen carried by the wind can lead to gene flow between different plant populations, increasing genetic diversity within and between these populations.  Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation, providing the raw material for evolution to act upon. Mutations are random changes in the DNA sequence that can result from errors in DNA replication, exposure to mutagens, or other factors. While most mutations are deleterious or neutral, some provide a selective advantage in certain environmental conditions. For example, a mutation that confers resistance to a new antibiotic may become more prevalent in a bacterial population under the selective pressure of that antibiotic.  Understanding genetic variation is crucial for studying evolution and biological diversity. Genetic variation refers to the diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population or species. This diversity arises from the presence of different forms of genes, known as alleles, at specific genetic loci. Genetic variation can be observed at different levels, including nucleotide sequence variation within genes, chromosomal rearrangements, and even variations in gene expression patterns.  Genetic variation is essential for the long-term survival and adaptation of populations. It provides the raw material for natural selection to act upon, allowing populations to respond to changing environmental conditions. Higher levels of genetic variation can increase a population's ability to adapt to new challenges, such as climate change or the emergence of new diseases. Conversely, low genetic variation can limit a population's ability to respond to environmental stressors, making them more vulnerable to extinction.  Several factors influence genetic variation within populations. One key factor is the rate of mutation, which introduces new genetic variants into a population. Different organisms have varying mutation rates, with some species, like bacteria, having high mutation rates due to rapid reproduction and exposure to mutagens. Recombination, the reshuffling of genetic material during meiosis, also contributes to genetic variation by creating new combinations of alleles on chromosomes.  Natural selection plays a crucial role in shaping genetic variation within populations. Selective pressures can lead to the increase or decrease in frequency of specific alleles based on their fitness advantage in a given environment. For example, in populations of peppered moths during the industrial revolution, the frequency of dark-colored moths increased due to pollution darkening tree trunks, providing better camouflage from predators.  Genetic drift, gene flow, and other evolutionary processes can also influence genetic variation within populations. Genetic drift can lead to the fixation of alleles in small populations, reducing genetic variation over time. In contrast, gene flow can increase genetic variation by introducing new alleles from other populations. These processes interact with each other and with natural selection to shape the genetic diversity of populations and species.  The study of genetic variation and evolutionary mechanisms has practical applications in various fields, including medicine, conservation, and agriculture. In medicine, understanding genetic variation is essential for personalized medicine and the study of genetic disorders. Genetic variation can influence an individual's response to drugs, susceptibility to diseases, and overall health outcomes.  In conservation biology, genetic variation is critical for maintaining the long-term viability of populations and species. Low genetic diversity can reduce a population's ability to adapt to changing environments, increasing their risk of extinction. Conservation efforts often focus on preserving genetic variation through strategies such as captive breeding, genetic monitoring, and habitat restoration.  In agriculture, genetic variation is essential for crop improvement and food security. Plant and animal breeders rely on genetic variation to develop new varieties with desirable traits, such as disease resistance, high yield, or nutritional quality. Understanding the genetic basis of these traits allows breeders to select for specific alleles and accelerate the breeding process.  Advances in technology, such as next-generation sequencing and genome editing, have revolutionized the study of genetic variation and evolutionary mechanisms. These tools allow researchers to study genomes at unprecedented levels of detail, uncovering hidden genetic variation and understanding its impact on evolution. Techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 enable precise manipulation of genes, opening new possibilities for genetic research and biotechnological applications.  In conclusion, evolutionary mechanisms and genetic variation are fundamental concepts that underlie the diversity of life on Earth. Natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation interact to shape the genetic diversity of populations and drive evolutionary change. Understanding genetic variation is essential for studying evolution, biodiversity, and the practical applications of genetics in medicine, conservation, and agriculture. By delving into these concepts, we gain insight into the intricate processes that have shaped life on our planet and continue to influence its future.""","1236"
"1","""Since the fourteenth century the practice of medicine has become a profession, and more importantly, a male-dominated profession. Previously medicine was seen as a female duty, however all areas of medicine have been professionalized over the centuries, and slowly become male-dominated, even the practice of obstetrics, which until the twentieth century, was still viewed as a female responsibility. This rise of medicine has had many implications for women; in this essay I will discuss them. The most important, both in terms of gender and class, was the exclusion of women from what had previously been a female occupation, and their confinement into inferior areas of medicine. However I will also examine the effects the rise of the profession of medicine had on women in relation to how women were viewed from the nineteenth century onward, and also the practical impacts that it had upon women receiving treatment, especially in the case of childbirth. In terms of class I will look at how working-class women received different treatments, as a result of the rise of medicine as a profession, and also how, consequently, the divisions between working-class and upper-class women increased. I will begin by looking at one of the most important implications; women's exclusion from medicine. In previous centuries health care tended to be carried out by female lay-healers within the community (Witz, 992). Female lay-healers were valued members of the community and as a result gained high status. They cared for the sick and elderly, and were also relied upon to produce drugs and remedies for their patients (Moscucci, 990). As females were seen as closer to the earth it was felt that they were most suited to carrying out the role of carer within the community, however medicine slowly began to develop as a form of science, rather than an occupation relating to nature, and male domination of the occupation began. From the 700's the view developed that rationality and science were most important, however these were qualities associated with men, rather than women, who were seen as emotional and religious, not scientific, and as the body began to be viewed from a scientific perspective it was these qualities that were required in the practice of medicine (Donnison, 993). Men also placed emphasis upon these qualities to justify their dominant role within medicine. Education was introduced to train people in the practice of medicine, and in 85/88, the Medical Registration Act secured medicine as a profession (Witz, 992). However, this also ensured the exclusion of women from medicine. As medicine came to be based on qualifications, rather than experience, patriarchal institutions were able to ensure women were excluded from medicine. They were unable to gain entry into the Universities offering qualifications in medicine, for example the University of Edinburgh, and prevented from taking exams that would gain them a place on the Medical Register (Witz, 992). Although several women, including Sophie Jex Blake, managed to gain university places, they were subject to prejudice and abuse by fellow students, and following their entry onto the Medical Register, universities changed their policies, ensuring that although women could study medicine, they would not necessarily qualify to practice it (Witz, 992). This exclusion of women can also be traced in the area of midwifery. Until the twentieth century midwifery was viewed as a female responsibility, being viewed as inferior to other areas. Although from the 700s onwards there were several man-midwives, they did not deal with routine births, stepping in only if there was a problem; their role was similar to that of a surgeon (Donnison, 993). However post-730's their role changed, and they became increasingly involved in routine births, especially with the upper and middle classes. What was seen as 'a problem birth' was redefined, for example prior to this time breech births were regarded as normal, and female midwives considered able to deal with them competently, but as they came to be seen as a problem, male surgeons began to participate in an increasing number (Oakley, 984). Despite these advances, it was not until the twentieth century that midwifery became recognised as central to general practice (Moscucci, 990), and qualifications were deemed necessary to practice of midwifery, with the 902 Midwives Act (Oakley, 984). This resulted in women being further pushed out of an area which they had continued to dominate, despite the professionalisation of the rest of medicine. This also had class implications, as although women were accepted by lying-in hospitals to train in midwifery they had to pay for the privilege, ensuring that it was only those from the skilled classes who could qualify (Donnison, 993). Previously, midwifery had been based largely on experience rather than qualification, so was practiced by many working-class women. Overall, one of the most important implications for women, was their excluded from an occupation previously regarded as female, as well as ensuring that only certain classes could enter the profession, which limited the options open to women who needed to work. It impact can still be seen today, as medicine is still a male-dominated practice, and the areas that women do enter, for example nursing, are regarded as inferior to the male-dominated areas, such as surgery. However it was not the only significant impact. Another major implication was the way in which women were depicted by the medical profession. As men wished to justify their exclusion of women from medicine, they redefined how women were viewed. As well continuing to portray them as too emotional to enter what they saw as the world of science, men also began to associate women's bodies with evil, claiming they were inherently dangerous, and therefore needed controlling (Smart, 992). This would ensure that women were unable to enter medical profession, but also that men could retain control over women's bodies. However at the same time they also depicted women as frail, and therefore dependant upon the male medical practice (Moscucci, 990, Smart, 992). Both of these depictions ensured that women were unable to enter medicine, and guaranteed that it remained a male dominated profession. This had class implications for women, as those from the working classes were seen as the most dangerous, whereas frailty was largely associated with the upper and middle classes, which strengthened the divide between the upper and lower classes. It also impacted upon legislation, with further implications for women. As women were construed as dirty and dangerous by the medical profession, laws were created reflecting this point, for example the Contagious Diseases Acts in the 860's (Smart, 992), which created further controls for women, especially those from the working classes. The professionalisation of medicine also affected women in a more personal way. As it ensured the exclusion of women from medicine it meant that women seeking medical help had to see a male doctor (Donnison, 993), a change that caused problems especially in childbirth. It resulted in loss of dignity for women, as many did not wish to see a male doctor in such situations, resulting in many deaths as female midwives were not trained to deal with the problems, or meant that male surgeons had 'to work blind', under the covers, creating many errors (Donnison, 993). This implication was significant, as it was so personal, and did not just affect women who wished to enter the medical profession but all female patients. Having discussed the implications for women in relation to gender, and in some ways class, I will now focus more closely upon the class impacts. As the practice of medicine moved away from female lay-healing and towards a male profession many working-class women were denied access to medical care. As it became a profession the working classes could no longer afford to receive treatment, so many went without (Donnison, 993), and the medical profession focused its attention on upper- class women, claiming they were more fragile and in need of extra help, which further excluded working-class women from medical treatment. The few hospitals set up to provide for the working classes were poor quality, and the women were subjected to harsh treatments, which the upper classes who could afford to pay for superior treatment were not. They were treated as if they were dirty in some way, in a similar way to which prostitutes were handled under the Contagious Diseases Acts (Moscucci, 990). Upper-class women were able to use chloroform during birth, but no such aids were available to those from the working classes (Donnison, 993). Such differences in treatment helped to increase the division between the working and upper classes that I mentioned previously. Overall the rise of medicine as a profession had many implications for women. It excluded them from the practice, an occupation which had previously been female, a result which had many further implications for women in both gender and class terms. It resulted in the redefining of women, into inherently dangerous, yet fragile human beings, who were therefore dependant upon men, and the male medical profession, as well as having a negative affect on women patients, as many did not wish to see male doctors. It also removed one of the final areas of society from which women could gain status, ensuring that men now acquired this standing, as well as excluding working-class women from treatment as they could no longer afford it, increasing the divisions between women of different classes. Therefore the rise of medicine as a profession turned it into an area of male-dominance, reduced women's power and ensured that male control over women increased, as did the control of the upper classes over the working classes. The rise had a largely negative effect upon women, especially those from the working classes, and its legacy can still be seen in medicine today.""","""Gender and class inequalities in medicine""","1971","""Gender and class inequalities in medicine have been prominent issues that have persisted over the years, impacting both healthcare professionals and patients. In a field traditionally dominated by men and individuals from privileged backgrounds, these inequalities manifest in various ways, shaping access to care, career advancement opportunities, and overall health outcomes.  Historically, medicine has been a male-dominated field, with men holding positions of power and authority. Despite progress in recent decades, gender disparities persist. Women in medicine often face discrimination, lower pay, and challenges in career advancement. The concept of the """"glass ceiling"""" is alive and well in medicine, with women being underrepresented in leadership positions and academic medicine. This not only affects the individuals themselves but also perpetuates a lack of diverse perspectives in medical decision-making.  Moreover, the intersection of gender and class further compounds these inequalities. Women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds face additional barriers in accessing medical education and training opportunities. The cost of medical school and the demanding nature of training programs can act as deterrents for individuals with limited financial resources. This results in a lack of diversity in the medical workforce, with implications for patient care and health outcomes.  When it comes to patient care, gender and class biases can influence the quality of healthcare individuals receive. Research has shown that women and individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may receive substandard care compared to their male and wealthier counterparts. These biases can affect diagnoses, treatment decisions, and overall health outcomes, perpetuating a cycle of inequality within the healthcare system.  Addressing gender and class inequalities in medicine requires a multifaceted approach. Medical institutions need to create a more inclusive and equitable environment that supports the advancement of women and individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. This includes implementing policies to address pay disparities, promoting mentorship opportunities, and providing support for work-life balance.  Additionally, efforts to increase diversity in medical education and training programs are crucial to ensuring a more representative healthcare workforce. Scholarships, mentorship programs, and outreach initiatives targeted at underrepresented groups can help break down barriers to entry and create a more diverse pipeline of future healthcare professionals.  Healthcare providers also play a vital role in addressing gender and class inequalities in medicine. Training programs on unconscious bias, cultural competency, and diversity can help providers deliver more equitable care to all patients, regardless of gender or socioeconomic status.  In conclusion, gender and class inequalities in medicine are complex issues that have far-reaching implications for healthcare professionals and patients alike. By recognizing and addressing these disparities, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable healthcare system that prioritizes the well-being of all individuals, regardless of their gender or socioeconomic background.""","519"
"390","""The concept of 'will' for Schopenhauer is intended to ground the phenomenal world and set a limit to the universe. It is a metaphysical principle that Schopenhauer believes we have access to directly, unmediated by the principle of sufficient reason. The two main problems in understanding the concept of will are the epistemological question - how does Schopenhauer believe we have knowledge of the will? - and the constitutive question - what can Schopenhauer legitimately say about the will's nature? Kant's critical philosophy set out to set a limit to human knowledge; to delimit the conditions of our knowledge of the world and thereby that beyond which we can not legitimately think. For Kant, the empirical world is determined by our subjective faculties. That is to say that there are conditions set upon our experience of the world by our constitution as subjects. The world exceeds our faculties' ability to cognize however; the world as it exceeds our faculties' abilities is by definition unknowable: this Kant calls the thing-in-itself. Schopenhauer's philosophy represents an attempt to give content to this thing-in-itself; consequently at first glance it appears highly paradoxical. The world as mediated by the nature of the faculty of sensibility and the pure concepts of the understanding in Kant is refigured as the world of representation - the world under the fourfold principle of sufficient reason. Schopenhauer's claim is that we can have direct knowledge of something that is not subject to the conditions of representation through our experience of our own bodies. Within the world as representation, as mediated by the subject, all things are related to a ground: the intellect relates material things to their causes and effects; it grounds abstract concepts using the laws of logic; mathematical and geometric matters are grounded in numbers and spaces; psychological questions of motivation are related to intentions as their ground. In Kant's philosophy, the limits of reason are revealed by antinomies that are reached when one attempts to think through the different principles that determine our cognising of the what sense is experience of willing not subject to the conditions of representation; leads us from experience of the will to the knowledge of the unity of will? If I feel a desire for a glass of water, we would be inclined to think of such a desire as individuated from the rest of my desiring by its single end and its duration in time. But individuation only takes place for Schopenhauer in the world as representation. Thus we must abstract our notion of the will from its ends and its specific duration to gain an idea of it as unified. Then the knowledge of the unity of will occurs by an act of thought. I must suppress consciously any ends my desire craves to gain knowledge of the ultimate unity of willing. This has the interesting consequence that in coming to recognise the world as will I suppress the influence that the will to life - willing as it follows the directions it takes in me qua living creature, as directed towards specific ends. This is entirely in keeping with Schopenhauer's thesis that knowledge is opposed to willing as release from it. We have not done enough to free ourselves of the suspicion that our experience of willing is subject to the conditions of representation. In his earliest work Schopenhauer had assimilated reasoning about intentions to the world of representation: intentions are grounds with the world as representation. This highlights the peculiarity of Schopenhauer's thinking. The felt experience he wishes to draw our attention to is more primary than any experience of desiring that I begin to make coherent to myself by consciously positing objects for it or reasoning about it. It is difficult not to assimilate this purported experience of self back to the deeply felt unity of all things which Simmel charges is Schopenhauer's motivation. Schopenhauer is himself ambiguous - at least - about the knowledge we have of the will. If it is mediated by the world as representation then it has to be taken as inferential knowledge. Obviously, this knowledge would then be achieved according to the fourfold principle mentioned above and thus would not represent a different method of knowing. Let's examine the argument on this account. On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason La Salle, Ill: Open Court,. If we take Schopenhauer's move inferentially, he believes that we can move from the premise that individuation occurs in the world as representation to the conclusion that outside the world of individuation there is no individuation. This is clearly warranted only on the assumption that conditions of individuation within the world as representation are the only possible conditions of individuation, which is not logically required. We may not be able to make sense of such a type of individuation, but beyond the conditions of the possibility of our experience there may be such an individuation. Logically then, Schopenhauer's inference is unsound. Schopenhauer also talks of our knowledge of the will as unmediated - direct. We can discriminate between two questions: what is the ground of any individual act of willing - why am I willing x at t? - and what is the ground of all my willing - why do I will at all? The former can admit of an answer on the level of representation, the latter requires a different ground. The situation is the same regarding gravity: any falling object can be referred to gravity as its ground, but gravity itself cannot be so grounded. Here is the key to the intuition at the heart of the concept of the will: it is movement. What is left when one has abstracted ends from willing? Movement. What is to be explained when gravity is referred to its ground? Movement. The intuition Schopenhauer believes that we can grasp from our experience of ourselves as embodied subjects is an intuition of movement within a multiplicituos unity, a differentiating unity; there is a process of individuation immanent to the will. However, we must be careful; the will does not cause its objectification into individuals, but the objectification comes from its own nature. Mankind's understanding is objectified will. The subject/object split is objectified will. That is to say that there is nothing in the world which is not will, including the mechanism by which one comes to take the world as representation. This is a necessary consequence of Schopenhauer's adaptation of Kant: the thing-in-itself grounds the subject in Kant. The subject finds its own spontaneity springing from the thing-in-itself. The thing-in-itself is will for Schopenhauer, thus it has to ground the subject. On the account that I have given, the problem then arises: how can one renounce will? If the subject is to be taken as immanent to the will, as an objectification of it, any act of renunciation would ipso facto be an act of will. The alternative would be to leave the subject unexplained as the ground of the world - a form of idealism Schopenhauer must escape from, for if the subject grounds the world, the will cannot. One has to make a choice here: reassert dualism - there are mental, world-constituting acts and facts that are not of the nature of the will-objectification monist axis; or reconfigure Schopenhuaer's ethical philosophy so that renunciation is seen as an act of will (certainly a far from insignificant change which fundamentally alters Schopenhauer's ethics). We have seen that regarding the epistemological problem, Schopenhauer believes that we have knowledge through the body of movement towards an end, will. We have questioned whether his account is coherent: if Schopenhauer believes we have inferential knowledge of a unified will his inference is invalid. If he believes we have direct knowledge of unindividuated will he is surely mistaken; furthermore he seems to be expressing an intuition about the world which one may accept or reject according to temperament. The best possible way of taking Schopenhauer's argument may be to take him as saying that the best possible explanation of empirical acts of willing is to postulate a metaphysical unity of the will. However, we have seen - regarding the constitutive question - that the move to the unity of the will is invalid. In conclusion, it is hard not to agree with Simmel that Schopenhauer's metaphysics of the will is a result of a deeply felt intuition of the world as unified. This oneness, expressed through the concept of the will, is not supported by the evidence he gives. Although it may be possible to make sense of the notion of a unity differentiating itself through movement, in Schopenhauer's philosophy we are not persuaded of the need for such a notion.""","""Schopenhauer's concept of will""","1757","""Arthur Schopenhauer, a prominent 19th-century German philosopher, delved deep into the nature of existence and human behavior, introducing the concept of """"will"""" as a central theme in his philosophy. According to Schopenhauer, the will is the fundamental driving force behind all phenomena in the world. This concept of will goes beyond mere desire or intention; it encompasses a pervasive, irrational, and insatiable force that underlies all human actions and the workings of the universe.  Schopenhauer's notion of will as the primary essence of existence draws from Eastern philosophies, especially Indian metaphysics like Vedanta and Buddhism. He posited that this will, often seen as a blind and ceaseless striving, animates not only human beings but all living creatures and even inanimate objects. This universal will manifests in various forms, from the simple desires of an individual to the complex mechanisms of evolution and the movements of celestial bodies.  For Schopenhauer, the will is a metaphysical concept that precedes individual consciousness. He believed that human actions are not always rational or driven by conscious motives but are often guided by this unconscious will. This idea challenges the Enlightenment notion of rationality as the primary driver of human behavior, proposing instead that our will operates independently of reason, often leading to conflicting desires and impulses.  One key aspect of Schopenhauer’s philosophy is his pessimistic view of human existence. He argued that since the will is insatiable and constantly seeks satisfaction, human life is characterized by suffering and unfulfilled desires. This relentless striving, coupled with the ephemeral nature of satisfaction, ultimately leads to a state of perpetual longing and dissatisfaction. Schopenhauer famously remarked that """"life swings like a pendulum backward and forward between pain and boredom.""""  Moreover, Schopenhauer saw the individual's will as a source of conflict not only with external challenges but also with other individuals. The clash of individual wills results in competition, aggression, and ultimately the perpetuation of suffering. This idea anticipates later philosophical concepts such as Freud's theory of the unconscious mind and Nietzsche's exploration of the will to power.  Despite the somber outlook on existence, Schopenhauer suggested that there could be a path to transcend the suffering inherent in the will. He believed that through aesthetic experiences, such as art, music, and contemplation, individuals could temporarily suspend their individual wills and achieve a state of inner peace and unity with the world. In these moments of aesthetic contemplation, one can escape the endless striving of the will and find solace in the beauty and harmony of existence.  In conclusion, Schopenhauer's concept of will as the underlying force of reality offers a profound lens through which to understand human behavior and the nature of existence. By highlighting the irrational, insatiable, and often conflicting nature of the will, Schopenhauer challenges conventional views of reason and rationality in shaping human actions. His exploration of the universality of the will, coupled with his pessimistic appraisal of life's inherent suffering, continues to inspire philosophical inquiry into the complexities of human experience and the quest for meaning in a seemingly chaotic world.""","628"
"92","""The question of what determines long run economic growth has divided Macroeconomists over the last twenty years. According to Solows' neoclassical view, growth can only occur with the change of exogenous factors. Endogenous growth theorists suggest however that economic growth stems from a change from within the structures of the economy. At the base both models share a set of common assumptions. Both production functions are of the form Y= (effective labour force) and some parameter well. By firstly describing the Solow model, secondly, analysing the most prominent of endogenous growth models, the AK model I will finally establish which model is the closest to reality by focusing my attention on their differences. Solow modelAssumptions:a. The Solow model assumes decreasing marginal productivity of inputs. An individually added unit of K or L will thus have a smaller effect on output than a previous one. Illustrating this effect are the Inada conditions, showing that as K and L tend to the slope of the production function will be as K and L tend to, the slope of the production function will flatten: as, as In line with these assumptions, the Cobb Douglas-type production function will be the most appropriate and easy to use, yielding: Barro and Sala-i - Martin p.6-9 where. This allows for the following diagrammatic representation: characteristics:A. Steady StateThe Solow model suggests that every economy is in equilibrium, once it reaches its steady state, characterised by a capital growth level of zero. In order to compare capital and income levels across countries, one has to take per capita capital and income levels into consideration instead of absolute values of K and Y. The following notations will thus be used: Y/L= proportionate amount of income saved, adding k directly to the growth equation. A given level of material depreciation,, that is inherent due to wear of machinery, reducing the pace of capital growth. New entrants into the workforce or the population growth, n, that will push k-growth downwards. As population grows the given level of capital must be spread over more workers, which eventually leads to a decline in k. These three elements lead to the following differential equation: Gartner, M p.38 determine a condition for the steady state k-level, we must rewrite the following way:, where. As in the steady state, we obtain the following steady state condition: shows that there exists a capital per capita level at which the savings, and thus investment levels, will exactly compensate for the fall in k due to depreciation and population growth. Graphically, the steady state is thus represented by the cross point between and savings diagram, one can demonstrate that k and y will investment levels rise, given all other factors stay the same. Population growth on the other side is negatively related to y. The upward shift around the origin of the depreciation line shows that the new k and y values are clearly lower than the initial steady state values of y and k. A higher fraction of savings must go simply to keep the capital-labour ratio constant in the face of growing population. Barro and Sala-i-Martin p.5/8,6 Graph and show how close to reality the above mentioned interactions and income growth and income are. Graph draws real GDP per worker on investment for a group of heterogeneous countries. Its upward sloping line of best fit clearly proves the positive relationship between the investment real GDP per worker. Jones, C p.3 With regards to population growth and income Graph shows that countries with lower birth from higher real GDP per worker. Economies with higher population growth see their GDP distributed over a larger number of workers, which eventually leads to a fall in real income per worker. Population growth and GDP are negatively related. Jones, C p.4 B. Stability and convergence of steady stateBy replacing Ak in in the long run capital will eventually reach its steady state level. Drawing the two curves clearly shows that an economy will grow or shrink temporarily but eventually reach its k. If kk) however, k will decrease and its growth rate will thus be negative until k is reached. Hence the further an economy is ahead of the steady grow faster than richer the last 0 years finds its proof in the data of homogeneous countries. The reason for these opposing results is that homogeneous economies will have one common steady state value and thus all converge towards the same k and y. By, however considering economies with heterogeneous economic patterns, we lack of one common benchmark steady state level. We are thus not able to compare the various growth data in one given framework. To be in the position to compare different countries we must consider the concept of conditional convergence: An economy will grow faster; the further it is away from its own steady state. Graph underlines this neoclassical theory prediction by drawing growth rates of GDP per worker against the deviation from steady state in 960. Korea, Japan and Singapore are prime examples of countries that exhibited a high growth level and were the furthest away from their respective steady state. Jamele Rigolini, lecture notes Jones C. p.5/8 AK-modelAssumptions:Endogenous growth models do not assume decreasing returns to capital. Theoretically this stems from the idea of an augmented Human capital production function of the form:. Where H is human capital, which usually is comprised in the Total factor productivity parameter A. It is now assumed that human capital is positively related to capital per worker, i.e H=K/L. The intuition behind the assumption is such that workers that have access to more and sophisticated machinery will be able to improve skills and knowledge faster than other ones. The production function is now of the form of: Gartner M p.75/8-77 Y=AK, dividing both sides by L y=Ak This type of endogenous growth model is known as AK-model because it was developed by Auerbach and Kotlikoff. Conveniently the resulting production function only consists of total factor capital a constant parameter independent of k. Hence, as capital stocks rise, production grows constantly at a given rate. Capital not only adds to production directly but indirectly as well by raising human capital. Growth is thus endogenised: The diminishing returns encountered by k in the direct effect are counteracted by the growth of technology, in turn proportionate to. In the AK model output growth can thus be influenced by an internal factor, unlike the Solow model where only exogenous lead to sustained growth. Characteristics:Diagrammatically, the production itself as straight line with the slope A. The savings thus be a less steeper line, since a given proportion income is saved. Identical to the Solow model, the capital accumulation over time follows the function:, where This allows for the following graphic representation: The only steady state in both panels is at the origin. Only in the steady state a stable equilibrium, because no matter how high levels of capital and income an economy may have initially, it will always regenerate back to its subsistent level. Savings are thus too low to compensate for the depreciation of capital and population growth 3. If however savings surpass population growth and depreciation levels, there is no steady state and capital will permanently accumulate, leading to infinitely rising income levels as only to play a more important role than TFP. Barro and Sala-i-Martin however found that the average growth rate of GDP is positively correlated to structural the existence of conditional convergence, since they underline Solows' theoretical predictions: The higher the initial value of income, the lower the growth rate. The inclusion of the investment GDP a comprised factor of population growth and positive and negative respective signs furthermore underline Solows theories. Countries with higher saving-levels ad lower population growth will experience starker GDP growth. Conclusion:Three main theoretical differences are at the base of the diverging views relating to growth: decreasing returns to scale, the existence of steady state levels towards which economies converge determinants of long term economic growth. Econometric literature overall supports the neoclassical idea of decreasing returns to scale, which are unlike initially assumed encompassed by both the growth of physical and human capital. The Solow model seems to find support on the idea convergence as well. Simple scatter graphs and Romer, Mankiw and Weil show that homogeneous countries do tend to grow in different paces, which lets them all converge towards one steady state. determinants of long run growth, it seems as though endogenous growth theorists have a more valid explanation by emphasising that growth can come from structural changes within the economy. Growth is thus not an external factor forced upon an economy, but much more a consequence of its policies, structures and behaviour.""","""Economic Growth Theories and Models""","1745","""Economic Growth Theories and Models:  Economic growth is a fundamental concept in economics that focuses on the increase in a country's production of goods and services over time. Understanding the theories and models that underpin economic growth is crucial for policymakers, economists, and businesses to make informed decisions that can drive sustainable development and prosperity. In this comprehensive exploration, we will delve into various economic growth theories and models that have shaped our understanding of how economies evolve and expand.  One of the earliest and most influential economic growth theories is the Harrod-Domar model, developed in the 1930s by economists Sir Roy Harrod and Evsey Domar. This model posits that the rate of economic growth depends on the level of savings and investment in an economy. According to the Harrod-Domar model, an increase in savings leads to higher investments, which, in turn, stimulates economic growth. This theory highlights the importance of capital accumulation in driving long-term economic expansion.  Building upon the Harrod-Domar model, another key theory of economic growth is the Solow-Swan model, named after economists Robert Solow and Trevor Swan. The Solow-Swan model introduces the concept of technological progress as a key driver of economic growth. In this model, economic growth is not solely dependent on capital accumulation but also on technological advancements that increase productivity and efficiency in the production process. The Solow-Swan model emphasizes the role of innovation and technological change in fostering sustained economic development.  In addition to the Harrod-Domar and Solow-Swan models, other theories have emerged to explain economic growth from different perspectives. The endogenous growth theory, pioneered by economists like Paul Romer and Robert Lucas, challenges the traditional assumption that technological progress is exogenous by asserting that it is endogenous to the economic system. This theory suggests that investments in human capital, research and development, and innovation can be actively encouraged through policies, leading to sustained economic growth.  Furthermore, the New Growth Theory, championed by economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Philippe Aghion, emphasizes the role of institutions, market structures, and incentives in fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. This theory suggests that a conducive regulatory environment, strong property rights protection, and efficient financial markets are essential for promoting long-term economic growth by encouraging investment and risk-taking.  Moreover, the concept of inclusive growth has gained prominence in recent years, highlighting the importance of ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared equitably among all segments of society. Inclusive growth aims to address income inequality, improve access to education and healthcare, and create opportunities for marginalized groups to participate in and contribute to the economy.  In practical terms, economic growth theories and models are used by governments and policymakers to design strategies and policies that promote sustainable development and enhance the overall well-being of their populations. By understanding the key determinants of economic growth, such as savings, investment, technological progress, human capital, and institutional quality, policymakers can implement targeted interventions to catalyze economic expansion and improve living standards.  Overall, economic growth theories and models provide valuable frameworks for analyzing and predicting the dynamics of economic development. By exploring the interplay between various factors that drive growth, economists can offer insights into how countries can achieve long-term prosperity and mitigate challenges such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. As we continue to grapple with complex global issues, a nuanced understanding of economic growth theories and models will be essential for shaping a more sustainable and equitable future for all.""","699"
"276","""Rousseau put huge significance and value onto the concept of freedom, it was something he thought everyone desperately needed as a fundamental part of their humanity. Yet in his theory he demands individuals submit to the state and, more importantly to the immutable general will which acts for the benefit of all society and thus logically appears to be asking individuals to sacrifice freedom for the greater general good of all. It leaves us asking what Rousseau regards as more important, general will or individual freedom as there appears an inherent contradiction between the two. For Rousseau all problems stem from society, it is inherently bad and has a corrupting influence on men turning them into vain and selfish individuals where they had previously 'lived free, honest, healthy and happy lives'. The establishment of property, money and industry within society lead to mans greed, as he farmed he wished to own and as he owned he began to wish 'to occupy the whole of the land' In this sense humans have become slaves, to their own selfish desires and bound by others into negotiations made to try and benefit themselves. Rousseau recognises that individuals cannot return to their state of original perfection, instead there needs to be a corrective invented within society to protect all individuals but in a way in which 'man remains as free as before'. Has Rousseau set himself an impossible task? In his social contract Rousseau set out to claim and illustrate that, in fact, 'a free will can exist only as part of a rational political order'. Rousseau, J. (Watkins, K trans/ed) Political writings: containing 'The social contract,' 'Considerations on the government of Poland,' and part of the 'Constitutional project for Corsica' London: Nelson. Social Contract: In Hobbes man has to sacrifice his liberty to a leviathan for the greater gain of his security, entering into a safe and civil society and leaving the savage world where threats are all around. Rousseau prides his contract on getting around what he sees as Hobbes's inherent problem, the concept that humans have to submit unyieldingly to an authority external to them. To give up ones freedom is, for Rousseau, rendering one unable to enact moral actions, surrendering our humanity in such a way equates to us becoming slaves. This is because, for Rousseau, the in fact collective man himself. That is to say man gives his liberty away to himself, as Rousseau said 'each man, in giving himself to all, gives himself to nobody'. The sovereign instigates only the general will which, by definition, will only act in the interests of society as a whole. Within the social contract everyone agrees to the same conditions and therefore all are equally willing to cooperate. Having committed totally to the social contract and to the general will individuals will not oppose the state as it attempts to enact the general will. This is because the state or sovereign, which makes the general will, is in fact collective society itself. Finally Rousseau argues that within the social contract all are equal and so people can have their natural freedom, even if it be due to collective autonomy as opposed to the natural autonomy of actions prior to society developing. Rousseau, J. Social Contract: Rousseau differentiates between what he calls natural, moral and civil freedom. A natural freedom would be one where man governed himself with total free will and autonomy from all other men, free from any from of social interaction. This, however is impossible within society as it exists now because man has already been corrupted and is inextricably linked to his own desires and within agreements made with others. However within a social contract, where no man is above another imposing decision upon him, man can have his natural freedom and be autonomous in his actions. So too man will discover another type of freedom which redeems himself and allows himself to become free in his higher self- that is free from amor se power over others. This not only denies the law breaker their individual free will or freedom but is also encouraging the other individuals within the collective to impose upon another's freedom and, in essence, to violate it which could surely just promote self interest and corruption for them. How can Rousseau maintain the general will encompasses the will of all and that all are free when the collective sovereign could justifiably have thousands locked away and therefore excluded from contributing to the general will and denied their own personal freedom. Neuhouser suggests that, where we do not recognise the general will as our own, it may well be our 'truest' will that we do not know, in such a case 'my subjection to it dictates freedom'. Whether this claim can hold fast under scrutiny, however, is debatable. Rousseau, J. Social Contract: Neuhouser, F Freedom, Dependence and the General Will URL accessed 3/3/5/8. Perhaps to understand how Rousseau conceptualised the social contract as the only path to fully realize out freedom we have to understand how bleak he was about our present. He viewed the world as full of people who are imprisoned both from following only physical, empty desires and also from each other due to endless bargains and power struggles. Rousseau relies on the idea that, so long as individuals have contributed to the making of the general will, individuals will accept it and obey it freely. Within his social contract there is an expectation that individuals will act upon the general will, that they will see it as a key contributor to their freedom. If we agree with Rousseau's perception of the world as it is then we can definitively agree that within the social contract man enjoys more, if not absolute, freedom than in his perceived state of nature. However when this is out under scrutiny so too is Rousseau's claim that man has perfect freedom within the contract. So too although the contract may offer more freedom it still entails sacrifice and, for the unfortunate few who break the law, it entails no individual freedom at all but what appears to be a lack of freedom an, indeed, of justice too.""","""Rousseau's Concept of Freedom and Governance""","1220","""Jean-Jacques Rousseau, an influential philosopher of the 18th century, had profound insights into the concepts of freedom and governance. His ideas laid the groundwork for modern political theory and influenced revolutions and the development of democratic societies. Rousseau's concept of freedom was deeply intertwined with his views on governance, emphasizing the importance of individual rights, social contract, and the general will.  Central to Rousseau's philosophy is the idea that true freedom lies in self-governance. He believed that individuals should be free to act according to their own will while also being guided by the collective interests of society. For Rousseau, freedom was not merely the absence of external constraints but the ability to live in harmony with others while maintaining one's autonomy. This concept of freedom as both individual and collective responsibility laid the foundation for his theories on governance.  Rousseau argued that the legitimacy of government stems from a social contract among individuals. In his seminal work, """"The Social Contract,"""" he posited that people come together to form a society and agree to be governed by a common set of laws for the benefit of all. This social contract binds individuals to the general will of the community, which represents the common good and the collective interests of the people. Rousseau believed that a just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed and exists to uphold the general will.  Unlike other social contract theorists, Rousseau emphasized the primacy of the general will over individual wills. He contended that the general will, which reflects the shared aspirations and values of society, should guide the decisions of the government. Rousseau believed that when individuals participate in the political process and contribute to the formation of the general will, they are truly free because they are acting in accordance with their best interests as members of the community. This idea challenged the prevailing notions of governance at the time, which often prioritized the interests of the ruling elite over those of the general population.  Rousseau's emphasis on the general will as the foundation of legitimate authority raised important questions about the nature of democracy and representation. He believed that a genuine democracy requires active citizen participation and a commitment to the common good. Rousseau's ideal society was one where citizens were engaged in civic life, deliberating on public matters, and working together to achieve the collective well-being. This vision of participatory democracy continues to resonate in contemporary discussions on governance and political participation.  Moreover, Rousseau's concept of freedom and governance has significant implications for contemporary political thought and practice. His emphasis on self-governance, civic engagement, and the common good challenges us to reevaluate our understanding of democracy and the role of government in society. In an era marked by political polarization and growing distrust in institutions, Rousseau's ideas remind us of the importance of fostering a sense of community, promoting dialogues, and working towards the common good.  Furthermore, Rousseau's critique of inequality and injustice in society remains relevant today. He highlighted the corrosive effects of materialism, inequality, and social hierarchies on individual freedom and societal well-being. Rousseau's call for a more just and equitable society where all members have a voice in decision-making continues to inspire movements for social justice and political reform.  In conclusion, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's concept of freedom and governance offers profound insights into the nature of political authority, individual liberty, and the dynamics of social cooperation. His emphasis on the general will, social contract, and participatory democracy challenges us to rethink our understanding of freedom and responsibility in the context of governance. By reflecting on Rousseau's ideas, we can aspire to create more inclusive, democratic, and just societies where individuals can truly experience freedom as active participants in shaping their collective destiny.""","748"
"297","""Parity conditions play a key role in the comprehension of international financial markets and in a decision maker's strategic posture towards the markets. The parity conditions are 'benchmarks'. When they hold, they imply points of indifference between two financial choices and when invalid they indicate market forces favoring one alternative over another. Empirical analysis and evidence on departures from parity are most intriguing, as a violation of parity implies that opportunities exist which can be exploited or arbitraged away. Purchasing power a theory of exchange rate determination; a way to compare the average costs of goods and services between countries. The theory assumes that the actions of traders, motivated by cross-country price differences, induce changes in the exchange rate. In another vein, PPP suggests that transactions on a country's current account, affect the value of the exchange rate on the foreign exchange market. Model and MethodologyThe Law of one the foundation of the PPP theory, which states that in the absence of transportation and other transaction costs, competitive markets will equalize the price of an identical good in two countries, expressed in the same currency. Algebraic representation: Where St is the nominal exchange rate expressed as the domestic price of the foreign currency. The absolute version, states that the exchange rate is equal to the ratio of prices of the two countries in the long run. Another form - Relative PPP, suggests that the percentage change in the exchange rate is equal to the percentage change in the price for two countries. This theory suggests that exchange rates act in a way to counteract changes in the price levels between countries and equilibrate the purchasing power of the currencies. Formal version: Real exchange the, nominal exchange rate deflated by a ratio of foreign and domestic price levels: Where R t is the respective real exchange rate and P denotes price level, UK is the home country and US, the foreign country. The logarithmic form: PPP implies that the nominal exchange rate is equivalent to the difference in price levels. Consequently, short run deviations are equal to the log of the exchange rate plus the difference in price levels where d represents short run deviations from PPP. If d is equal to zero, then PPP subsists. An important consequence of PPP is that the RER between countries should not vary in the long run: Arbitrage and other effects should act to negate differences in purchasing power. These long run stabilizing forces implied by PPP thus make stationarity a vital consequence to the theory. Empirical research on PPP Empirical evidence about the validity of the PPP hypothesis has produced mixed results and developed along with advances in econometric techniques. Empirical tests confirm that PPP is a poor description of exchange rate behaviour in the short run due to exchange rate volatility and sticky prices, but in the longer run, PPP offers a good guide. The LOP was tested by the Big Mac Index published in 'The Economist'. This 'Hamburger standard' shows the difference in the average price of a Big Mac in various countries. As Peter Isard stated, '.the law of one price is flagrantly and systematically violated by empirical data.' Frankel found evidence in favour of PPP in hyperinflationary countries and no evidence for countries with low and moderate inflation. Examination of the RER equation provided the need for stationarity. This is - currencies go through periods of undervaluation and overvaluation that can be large, but there is tendency for PPP to reassert itself as time passes. Such investigations have tested the hypothesis of non-mean reversion against the alternative of mean reversion. Roll and Adler also tested the hypothesis that PPP follows a random walk. Kenneth Rogoff suggests that for a broad sample of countries, deviations from PPP maybe around to years, PPP deviations dampen out at the rate of 5/8% per year. According to Mark Taylor and David Peel the speed of return to PPP may increase when the deviation is larger. Balassa and Samuelson posited the productivity differential model concluding that the biggest difficulty in testing PPP is that the RER may change, thus leading to the failure of PPP. Econometric techniques for testing PPPPresent research tests PPP under three different specifications: As a univariate analysis of the RER, as defined by - A bivariate relationship between the nominal ER and the domestic to foreign price ratio - A trivariate relationship between the nominal ER, the domestic price level and the foreign price level - Since all variables in the PPP relationship are prices series so we may assume them to be non-stationary. We can establish the univariate non-stationarity of the series in our data set by the following analysis and tests:. Visual Inspection of the data: An observation and study of the line graphs and the correlograms of the logs of the nominal ER, and the domestic and foreign price level can be very informative. The ACF does not decay if the series is non-stationary. However, this inspection needs to be supplemented.. Augmented Dickey: The ADF test offers a formal test for nonstationarity in time series data. The principle behind the ADF equation is to test for the presence of a unit root in the coefficient of lagged variables. If the value of the coefficient of a lagged variable is and the choice of a lag variable, to ensure that the error terms are normally distributed and linearly independent. We use the Maximum eigenvalue statistic and the trace statistic to obtain the Cointegration rank. Secondly, we test the hypothesis based on the cointegrating vectors and adjustment parameters which can be used to test the validity of PPP, as well as the weak exogeneity assumption of the Engle-Granger Model. Summary analysis of the dataThis analysis was carried out, to test the PPP relationship between UK and US using the series for both countries as well as the spot exchange rate USD/GBP as data, which was downloaded from Ecowin database. Time Horizon - 1/1/95/87 to 1/3/006Data Type - MonthlyNumber of Observations - 91Notation:Home Foreign rate - s1 Mohammad S. Hasan - 'A century of PPP: evidence from Canada and Australia' Roger D. May & Dr. Philip Rothman - 'An econometric evaluation of purchasing power parity' Presentation and Interpretation of the main resultsUnivariate Analysis1. We first find the logs of the sample data. Visual Inspection of the graphs indicate that the series show a trend when we take variables in levels, which can be removed by using the first difference of the data. The differenced series - DLNP, shows a probable structural Correlograms shows that the series are non-stationary..b Correlograms of the PPP variables in ACF of the spot rates indicates that the returns are a white noise.. ADF. Levels of the given data shows: The Test statistic does not exceed the Critical values at the % as well as % level. This implies that the null hypothesis of a unit root for all the four series in levels cannot be rejected. b. Differences of the all the four difference series, the test statistic is more negative than the critical value; therefore we strongly reject the null hypothesis of a unit root in differences, implying that all the series have at most one unit root.. Testing the real exchange rate for. Visual Inspection - The presence of a unit root, may be visible, as the series appears to show long swings, also as the series often crosses its mean, it could imply that the series is stationary. b. Levels of the RER series show that the real exchange rate is non-stationary. c. Differences of the RER series imply that real exchange rate returns are stationary as the real exchange rate has one unit root. This provides evidence against PPP.. Phillips-Perron - We find results similar to the ADF tests, showing that the test statistic does not exceed the critical value at both the % and % levels for lns, lnp, lnpstar and lnrer. Hence we cannot reject the null hypothesis of a unit root. Differences - The test statistic exceeds the critical value by a very large amount. Therefore we strongly reject the null hypothesis. PPP doesn't exist between the UK and US, as the RER has a unit root.. KPSS Tests for test statistic is greater than the critical values at both the % and % levels for levels. This implies that RER is significant; since, in KPSS tests the null hypothesis is stationarity. Hence the KPSS test provides some evidence that the real exchange rate is stationary. Multivariate Cointegration Analysis. Engle-Granger -Step Estimator - Step- obtained coefficients coefficients are different from the values required by we conclude that - There is no Cointegration between the exchange rate and the relative prices There is no long run PPP relationship between the UK and US. This result implies that no ECM exists for the exchange rate. Step-We now observe that all the coefficients are insignificant, confirming both, that it is a poor model and that we found no cointegration at Step. A. Johansen FIML - We estimate the VAR and its lag order using the information since it penalizes errors more severely in case of extra parameters whereas the Akaike & Hannan-Quinn criteria suggest a. We use the, as it has more significance. The test for normality shows that it is highly non-normal. Estimating the Cointegrating rank, vectors and adjustment a, implies a therefore we specify lag intervals to do cointegrating testing. Both the trace and maximum eigenvalue tests, demonstrate the presence of two cointegrating vectors. However, the presence of the second cointegrating vector has no economic interpretation when testing for PPP. The cointegrating vector obtained is, as compared to the required vector of, indicating the normalising of the first coefficient in the vector. Thus it shows that that PPP is likely not to hold between UK and US. There is no autocorrelation in the VECM residuals, but White Test displays heteroskedasticity, a probable symptom of non-normality. Finally we test the model imposing restrictions. The Cointegration restriction test indicates that the model is significant which implies that PPP restrictions do not hold. (Appendix C) Lastly the model is tested imposing the weak exogeneity restrictions (Appendix D). The joint test of weak exogeneity and PPP restrictions are both strongly rejected. ConclusionThe Purchasing Power Parity between the UK and US is tested by employing the different methods described. Results signify only a partial evidence of long-run PPP between UK and US. The ADF and P-P tests indicated stationarity in levels and non-stationarity in differences of the series. Conversely the KPSS test provides evidence that the real exchange rate may be stationary. The Engle-Granger Model found no Cointegration between the nominal exchange rate and inflation in the two countries. Alternatively, the Johansen tests established that there exist two cointegrating vectors. PPP restrictions on the long-run parameters were rejected. It is not an unusual finding in empirical tests, and calls for better quality financial information on prices and reduction of measurement errors. Consequently, the results conclude that 'the use of PPP theory should be approached with a general caution'. The only authentic conclusion that can be drawn is that, further extensive studies are necessary to promote our understanding of the exchange rate behavior.""","""Purchasing Power Parity and Exchange Rates""","2299","""Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and exchange rates form the bedrock of international trade and financial transactions. Understanding the relationship between these concepts is crucial for businesses, policymakers, and individuals navigating the global economy. PPP theory posits that exchange rates between two currencies should adjust to ensure that a basket of goods and services would cost the same in both countries when expressed in a common currency. This theory serves as a benchmark for evaluating whether a currency is overvalued or undervalued concerning another.  Exchange rates, the pricing mechanism for currencies, play a vital role in international trade. They determine the value of one currency relative to another and have a significant impact on the competitiveness of a country's exports and imports. When one country's currency strengthens relative to another, its goods become more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially leading to a decrease in exports. Conversely, a weaker currency can make exports cheaper and boost a country's export competitiveness.  The interaction between PPP and exchange rates is crucial for businesses engaged in international trade. Exchange rate movements directly influence the profitability of exporting and importing goods and services. For exporters, a stronger domestic currency can lead to reduced revenues when converted back into the home currency, while importers benefit from a stronger domestic currency as it lowers the cost of imported goods. Understanding PPP helps businesses assess whether exchange rates adequately reflect the relative purchasing power of currencies, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding pricing, sourcing, and market entry strategies.  Purchasing Power Parity has different forms, namely Absolute PPP and Relative PPP. Absolute PPP asserts that the exchange rate between two currencies should equal the ratio of the price levels in the two countries. In contrast, Relative PPP focuses on the changes in price levels over time, stating that the exchange rate should adjust to reflect inflation differentials between countries to maintain PPP in the long run.  Despite its theoretical underpinnings, PPP theory faces several challenges in the real world. Factors such as transportation costs, trade barriers, differences in product quality, and non-tradable goods can lead to deviations from PPP. In practice, exchange rates often deviate from PPP for extended periods due to various factors, including market speculation, political events, economic policies, and market sentiment.  The Big Mac Index, developed by The Economist magazine, is a popular informal method of measuring PPP by comparing the prices of a Big Mac burger across different countries. This index provides a simplistic yet illustrative way to understand the concept of PPP in a real-world setting, showing the differences in prices for a standardized product to assess currency valuation.  Central banks and policymakers closely monitor exchange rates and PPP as part of their efforts to maintain economic stability. Exchange rate policies influence a country's competitiveness, inflation rate, and overall economic performance. Central banks may intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilize exchange rates or to counteract fluctuations that could impact exports, imports, or inflation.  For investors, understanding PPP and exchange rates is essential for making informed decisions in the global financial markets. Exchange rate movements can affect the returns on international investments, as currency fluctuations can either enhance or erode investment gains. Investors often engage in currency hedging strategies to mitigate the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations and PPP disparities.  In conclusion, Purchasing Power Parity and exchange rates are fundamental concepts that underpin international trade, finance, and investment. While PPP theory provides a theoretical framework for understanding currency valuations, exchange rates play a critical role in determining the competitiveness of economies and the profitability of businesses engaged in global trade. By grasping the interplay between PPP and exchange rates, businesses, policymakers, and investors can navigate the complexities of the global economy more effectively and make informed decisions that drive sustainable growth and prosperity.""","738"
"6016","""A relationship between the market, the civil society and the state exists and each one of those sectors has its role and should act in collaboration with one another and not individually in order to address any failures. For example there is a specific circumstance where the state should intervene in order to address a market failure. More specifically, resources are allocated by the economic system based on the principles of demand and supply in the market. However, there is a category of goods, the so-called public goods that the market alone fails to supply. This category includes goods or services like street lighting, clean air, defense which are not restricted in use and non-excludable to non-payers, thus if they will be supplied they have to be supplied to everybody. In the case of such goods if the market has the entire responsibility and authority for providing them it would fail to supply them because it is not feasible to measure the amount consumed by each individual citizen and charge them accordingly like in the case of a private good for the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory' (Moran, 005/8). It is known that the state exerts great power and control over the lives of people who belong in its territory and it has the responsibility and authority for the allocation of resources among citizens of the can be described as 'the redefinition of structures, procedures and practices of governance to be closer to the citizenry' (Miller, 002). Decentralisation concerns 8 countries, developed and developing ones, however there is not a specific model of it but this varies between different gives it to others resulting in unequal distribution of the social welfare (Moran, 005/8). This kind of corruption could be fight off by the devolution of responsibilities and authorities from the central government to local governments. The term 'local government' refers to 'a sub-national level of government which has jurisdiction over a limited range of state functions within a defined geographical are which is part of a larger territory' or 'the institution or structures which exercises authority or carry out governmental functions at the local level' (Miller, 002). In addition to this, decentralisation in the form of 'transfer of state/national responsibilities or functions from central government to sub-national levels of government' offers opportunities for local sustainable development (Miller, 002). Since resources will be allocated at the local level and several functions will be carried out at the local level this will help to support local economies as well as the development of local regions. As stated by Miller, 'development will be driven locally based on the indigenous resources and comparative advantages of local entities rather than by external agents who are pre-occupied with many other priorities know little about local potential for development'. With the devolution of power, responsibilities and authorities are transferred to local governments and each region will have to make decisions and act for its own development (Miller, 002). The participation of civil society into the decision-making process can allow voice to minorities (e.g. marginalized groups). It also fulfills people's need to be involved in decisions that affect their lives. However, it is not only about that. Decentralisation in the form of participation has the potential of improved effectiveness and efficiency of public services provision. Since citizens can influence decisions about service provision they can determine the type and quality of services they want as well as their willingness to pay for this kind of services. All this process is a kind of market mechanism for determining service provision in a way that is according to citizens' wants and willingness to pay. This mechanism serves both as a way of maximizing citizens' fulfillment and provision of those kind of services that merge with their willingness to pay (Miller, 002). One of the main principles of decentralisation is the promotion of regional autonomy (Policy guidelines, 006). Devolution of the power and authorities from central government to sub-national levels of government i.e. local governments, gives each region/locality the opportunity to articulate its own needs, which may not coincide with the needs of the central government. However, those needs may also differ within different regions within the context of local governments. The monopoly of the centre will no longer exist and new centres of power will be developed in a local level, which will serve to meet the needs of local entities. The fact that needs might be different within different regions/localities leads to a pluralistic society and there are contradictable aspects on that. On the one hand, regional autonomy is viewed as a way of dividing a nation. On the other hand, in a society with plurality of needs decentralisation is considered essential for maintaining the unity and integrity of a nation (Meenakshisundaram, 994). Moreover, another positive aspect of decentralisation results from the participation of citizens in the decision-making process as well as the devolution of the power from the centre to a local level. Since citizens are entitled to fully participate in decision-making they feel that their needs and interests can be better fulfilled. In addition to this, the devolution of power into local governments makes people feel that the needs of local constituents are met. All this brings citizens closer to the government and helps to develop a strong relationship between the government and the citizens. As a final result of this citizens do not show any disruptive or anti-social behaviour, which could lead to conflicts resulting when citizens feel that their concerns and needs are not taken into consideration. So, a potential advantage of decentralisation is the establishment of a better relationship between the governors and the governed as well as reduction of the conflicts between the two parties (Miller, 002). Despite the positive aspects arising from decentralisation there are also possible risks and negative consequences that should be taken into account. Among such risks and negative consequences one could make reference to greater inequality and greater poverty gaps (Miller, 002). The fact that the devolution of centre government to local governments as it has already been mentioned is in favour of the devolution of government resources and allocation of some of them to regions/localities. This helps to reduce the gap between central government and local government in terms of resource allocation. However, even among a certain region/locality there are substantial differences in terms of natural resources and how are these allocated among its citizens. In a decentralised system there is always the risk of 'resources and power being captured by local elites or special interest groups' (Miler, 002). It is similar to the case where in a centralised system people at the centre concentrate all resources and use them for their own benefit. Indisputably, decentralisation is effective for ensuring distribution of government resources from central government to regions/localities, however, safeguard mechanisms are required to prevent gaps between regions (Miller, 002). It has already been mentioned that decentralisation through people's participation in the decision-making ensures that local needs and interests are met. However, similarly to the case of not equitable sharing of resources between the centre and the regions in a centralised system there is also a similar risk arising from local governments in a decentralised system. That is to say, even within a regional/local community being governed by a local government system, the weaker and poorer sections of the society may have the experience of their needs and interests not being met by these local levels of government. A good example of this is India, where 9% of the rural households own only % of all assets while % of the households own 6% of assets. As a result of this it will take a long time until this gap is eliminated and poor groups of people will be able to raise their voice ((Meenakshisundaram, 994). Undoubtedly, decentralisation helps toward the achievement of devolution of the power from the centre to a local level. It can also ensure a more equitable resource distribution between the centre and the regions/localities, however, poverty gaps between groups in the same regions/localities is inevitable to exist even within a decentralised form of government. Inevitably, corruption occurs both in a centralised and decentralised system because those people who have the power tend to allocate resources for their own interest. Decentralisation is thought to be a more complex form of governance since it involves the distribution of responsibilities, power and authorities among local levels of government. Given that state/national functions are transferred to local levels of government there is a need for careful planning and adequate organization. There are examples of decentralisation schemes, which had not been well planned, and as a consequence of the bad planning and implementation they failed to meet their objectives (Miller, 002). A good example of ineffective implementation of decentralisation is Indonesia. In particular, in the case of Indonesia, both central as well as local governments did not have the experience and knowledge required for the management, planning and implementation of decentralisation. There was also lack of organizational capacity in that governments were not efficient in allocating responsibilities and authorities among central and regional governments (Policy guidelines, 006). Despite the fact that decentralisation reduces anti-social behaviour of citizens and conflicts between governors and governed, it has the potential to be the reason for emergence of conflicts between national and local governments. The reasons lying behind that are two. Firstly, decentralisation in the form of participatory governance ensures that the needs and interests of local constituents are met. However, local interests may not necessarily agree with national interests and conflicts are possible to emerge between local and national levels of government. These differences of course mean that not only national but also local interests are considered which is an advantage of decentralisation is (Miller, 002). Secondly, even though it has been said that decentralisation ensures equitable resource sharing between the centre and the regions, what happens in reality is completely different. Particularly, central governments tend to capture the bulk of power and resources leaving local governments with inadequate resources that makes them not capable in their role (New Agriculturist, 006). To sum up, decentralisation in the form of devolution of power, responsibilities and authorities from the centre to sub-national levels of government has positive aspects as well as possible risks and negative consequences. Even though decentralisation has been connected with the reduction of the centre it is necessary for any attempt of decentralisation to succeed to maintain a strong centre. This is particularly important for the successful planning and implementation of decentralisation schemes as well as for the establishment of coherence between local and national levels of government (Miller, 002).""","""Decentralisation and governance dynamics""","2093","""Decentralization and Governance Dynamics  Decentralization, a term with profound implications across various sectors, is a concept that has gained significant traction in recent years. From blockchain technology to governance structures, decentralization represents a fundamental shift in how power, decision-making, and resources are distributed. In the realm of governance, this paradigm has the potential to transform traditional hierarchical systems into more inclusive, transparent, and effective models. This dynamic interplay between decentralization and governance is reshaping the way societies, organizations, and communities operate.  At its core, decentralization refers to the dispersal of power and authority from a central authority to multiple entities or levels. This redistribution of power can take many forms, ranging from political decentralization, where authority is devolved to local governments, to economic decentralization, where resources are distributed to various stakeholders. In the context of governance, decentralization seeks to empower individuals and communities by providing them with greater control over decision-making processes that directly affect their lives.  One of the key drivers of decentralization in governance is the desire for increased transparency and accountability. By dispersing power among multiple actors, decision-making becomes more open and accessible, reducing the risk of corruption and abuse of power. Decentralized governance structures also enable greater participation from a diverse range of stakeholders, ensuring that decisions reflect the needs and preferences of the community as a whole. This inclusive approach fosters a sense of ownership and collective responsibility, leading to more sustainable and equitable outcomes.  Blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful enabler of decentralization in governance. By creating tamper-proof, transparent, and decentralized ledgers, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize how governments and organizations operate. Smart contracts, self-executing agreements coded on the blockchain, can automate processes and ensure compliance, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing efficiency. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) leverage blockchain technology to enable decision-making through consensus mechanisms, allowing stakeholders to vote on proposals and influence governance structures directly.  Despite the many benefits of decentralization in governance, challenges and limitations exist that must be addressed. One of the primary concerns is the potential for fragmentation and lack of coordination when decision-making authority is dispersed. Ensuring coherence and alignment across diverse actors and entities can be complex, requiring robust communication mechanisms and shared goals. Additionally, issues of scalability, privacy, and security must be carefully considered when implementing decentralized governance structures to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of the system.  The role of leadership in decentralized governance is also a critical consideration. While traditional hierarchical models rely on centralized authority figures to make decisions, decentralized governance requires leaders to act as facilitators and coordinators, fostering collaboration and consensus-building among stakeholders. Effective leadership in decentralized settings involves promoting dialogue, fostering trust, and promoting a shared vision that aligns with the values and objectives of the community.  In conclusion, the dynamic interplay between decentralization and governance has the potential to reshape our social, political, and economic systems in profound ways. By decentralizing power and authority, we can create more inclusive, transparent, and equitable governance structures that empower individuals and communities to participate actively in decision-making processes. Embracing decentralization in governance requires a shift in mindset, from top-down control to bottom-up engagement, from centralized authority to distributed responsibility. As we navigate the complexities of the modern world, exploring the possibilities of decentralized governance offers a pathway towards a more resilient, adaptive, and sustainable future.""","684"

Several dynamics elements interact together in this scene by using it. These dynamics elements are: the the postman's car.

Then he pushes down the bell button and waits for someone open the door; a woman opens the door and comes just in front of the postman. They look for each other in their eyes and they fall in love how the animation is made, linked together etc. Static element:The main idea of the architecture of the SVG code is to define each static a tag and then, and then to use the tag to use this element. The schema below explain globally how is structured the SVG file. Obviously, each tag in the SVG file is identified by a different id, The car: A tag is included in the car definition in order to define every linear gradient used in the car. There is linear gradient: one for the window, one for the car body, one for the 'Royal Mail' text and a last for the wheels. The wheel is also include in a tag because there is two wheels for this car and it's useful to define a wheel and instance twice in a different used in order to fill the wall of the house and the roof. These textures are define in a tag and the texture area is define in a clip path tag. If an element is used several are the same for every character, the used and only the colour is changed.

"3159","""play with the normal codes of cooperation between people in a conversation. The way every script is constructed is carefully analysed and discussed by the writers in order to create the expected humour effect. They might not know but one of the principles that they use to achieve this is the Pragmatics one. According to Cutting, Pragmatics takes a socio-cultural perspective on language usage and studies its context, text and function. Therefore, this essay will provide a pragmatic analysis on one of the scripts taken from the American sitcom Friends. First, a short introduction to the Sitcom and its characters will be presented. Then Grice's conversational maxims of the Cooperative Principle, Brown and Levinson's Politeness theory and Leech's Politeness Maxims will be summarized and then illustrated throughout the text analysis. Finally, a conclusion will be drawn on the effectiveness of these frameworks to understand the text chosen and on the peculiarities discovered about the humour used in Friends. As described by Nash, 'humour is a specifying characteristic of humanity'. And although the sense of humour varies in different cultures, it seems to have some similarities that enabled Friends to be a huge success around the world. The sitcom involves the everyday life of six friends showing an exaggeration of real life situations. The characters themselves have distinct characteristics that help us to understand their ways of expression and reaction during the conversations. The chosen script is a scene from the tenth season of the series where five of the main characters - Rachel, Joey, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe - interact in their favourite coffee shop. Rachel is the 'fashion woman' and just had a baby with Emma. Joey is an actor and is very 'airhead'; he often takes a lot of time to understand jokes and indirect speeches. We could even argue that he would have a really hard time to understand Pragmatics. Monica and Chandler are married. Monica is a chef and is very perfectionist. Chandler works in advertisement and is very sarcastic and ironic at times. He loves making jokes and fun of other people. Finally, Phoebe is similar to Joey in 'airheadness'. She is the crazy one in the group who always have strange hypotheses for everything and has very unexpected reactions like the one seen on lines 2/3 of the text. She is a masseuse and has been dating Mark for a year now. A study on sitcom that 'humour can be derived from the deliberate scripting of flouted maxims'. These maxims are part of Grice's theory of the Cooperative Principle, cited in the on record with positive politeness. Finally, when the speaker is direct but trying to save negative face - the need to be independent and not be imposed on by or she is doing a on record with negative politeness. It will also be considered for this analysis the politeness maxims proposed by Leech. As seen in Cruse, there are types of politeness maxims: tact, generosity, praise, modesty, agreement and sympathy. The ones observed and flouted in this analysis are, as described in Cruse: Tact: minimize cost to hearer; maximize benefit to hearerGenerosity: minimize benefit to self; maximize cost to selfPraise: minimize dispraise of the hearer; maximize praise of the hearerModesty: minimize praise of self; maximize dispraise of selfThe conversation starts with Rachel making a comment about letting her baby, Emma, have her first cookie. This is then followed by Joey flouting the maxim of quality by exaggerating his statement in line with the use of a hyperbole - 'all the time'. What he intends to say is not that she eats cookies all the time but that it is certainly not the first. Because of this statement Joey puts himself in a very occurred situation where people can assume that he has given cookies to Emma before. Rachel's reaction is of a baldly on record face threatening act with a direct question to Joey in line. She violates the politeness maxim of tact by not being cautious, and leaves Joey no other choice but to violate the maxim of quality by not answering with the truth. In order to create a stronger comic effect he flouts the maxim of relevance and quality when saying that he also never gave her a frosting from a can. On line a new interaction starts between Monica, Rachel, Chandler and Joey. First, Monica uses on record negative politeness to minimize imposition on Rachel when asking her to write the letter to the adoption company. She gives Rachel the option to refuse it by inserting in her question an intentionally noncommittal statement: 'we were wondering'. Rachel being best friends with Monica surely doesn't refuse the request and accepts it flouting the maxim of quantity; adding more then a simply 'yes' to her answer in line 0. The whole situation upsets Joey who, on line 4, tries to catch everybody's attention by clearing his throat and consequently flouting the maxim of relevance and manner by saying that it has been an oversight. He produces an off record face threatening act giving a hint that he feels left out of their decision. The hearers, Monica and Chandler, can opt to comment on it or not. And so Chandler do it on lines 5/8 and 6 trying to save Joey's positive face when saying 'we would've asked you', and his negative face by 'we thought you wouldn't be interested'. Monica's reply is less tact than Chandler's though, probably because Chandler is Joey's best friend. In lines 7 and 8 she wants to give him some sympathy but she slightly insults him by saying he is not much 'with the words'. Either way, they are both flouting the maxim of quality because knowing Joey we can deduce that they didn't really thought of asking him after all. Joey then infringes - 'his performance is impaired by nervousness' as defined in Cutting - the maxim of quantity by not giving any information but just babbling along. He doesn't really know what to say, what provokes Monica to flout the maxim of quality by being sarcastic on line 0. She means the complete opposite of what she says. Joey continues to try convincing Monica and Chandler that he could write the letter. He flouts the maxim of quantity by giving more information than it is make his point. He also appeals to their positive face showing sympathy, claiming common ground and applying the politeness maxim of generosity. This generates Monica response of saying that they want him to do it. She doesn't need any politeness strategy here since Joey wants to write the letter and then there's no need of asking but just directly saying it. The seriousness is then broken by his open thoughts of how he is going to start the letter (lines 5/8 and 6). Chandler realizes their mistake of letting Joey write the letter and flouts the maxim of quality by being sarcastic in line 7. He is not at all excited because Joey just showed that he can be really bad 'with the words'. A new interaction is introduced with Phoebe arriving and saying 'hello' in line 9. Everybody answers back and Joey repeats his 'hello' implying something more to it and therefore flouting the maxim of quantity. He probably noticed that Phoebe is looking better dressed than usual. This is followed by Monica's remark to Phoebe's look on line 2. She is being indirect, and flouting the maxim of quantity and manner by not asking what she really wants to know. She both implies 'where are you going all nice' or 'why are you dressed all nice', and leaves Phoebe to interpret it and to answer if she wants. By this indirect action she is being polite off record also applying the politeness maxim of praise. Subsequently, Phoebe completely violates the politeness maxim of modesty by agreeing that she looks nice. However, this is expected of Phoebe and is what gives the humour to the passage. She also opts to answer Monica's implication making the statement that it is Mike's and her anniversary. It could be argued that Phoebe flouted the maxim of quantity since her statement invited questions to be made. First, Rachel asks a very direct question on line 4 that leaves Phoebe no choice but to answer it. This baldly on record question is followed by options to what the anniversary could be of. Phoebe then answers it with a simple 'yeah', not specifying which anniversary and so flouting the maxim of manner. We can assume she says 'yeah' for everything or just for the last part - 'first time you had sex'. Next it is Chandler's time to ask the question on line 7 deducing that Phoebe and Mike are going somewhere fancy to celebrate. He uses an off record politeness by flouting the maxim of manner. His intentions are to know where Phoebe and Mark are going but he only implies it so Phoebe can choose to answer 'yes' or 'no', or the name of the place they are going. She then flouts the maxim of quality when she says 'yes' to going to a fancy place and them ironically adding that the place is a basketball game, which is not fancy at all. Realizing that, Joey makes a direct - bald on record - question to Phoebe insinuating that she is not properly dressed for it. She understands the hint and consequently flouts the maxim of quantity by giving more information than necessary in order to her friends stop judging her. She also flouts the maxim of relevance when she highlights on line 3 that they are going to have sex in a public restroom. Monica then makes use of an on record positive politeness questioning Phoebe, on line 4, about having sex in the public restroom. She is very direct but makes a remark after the question that shares something about herself and Chandler, assuring Phoebe of their friendship and that is it alright to talk about it. To end the scene, Chandler tries to defend himself from the accusation that he doesn't even want to have sex in their bathroom. In order to do that he flouts the maxim of quality using a euphemism - saying 'number two' for defecating. Through this type of analysis one can come to the conclusion that the frameworks used were significantly effective to help comprehending the humour in the script. A constant flout of the maxims can be seen, specially the quantity and quality ones which create the typical comedy effect desired. It becomes clear that the sense of humour used in Friends is common among different cultures because of these basic principles of cooperation and politeness.""","""Humor in Conversations within Sitcoms""","2165","""Humor in Conversations within Sitcoms  Humor is a central element in sitcoms that has the power to captivate audiences and keep them coming back for more. Sitcoms, or situational comedies, rely heavily on witty dialogue, clever wordplay, and comedic timing to deliver laughs and entertain viewers. One of the key components of humor in sitcoms is the way characters engage in conversations with each other. Whether it's the quick banter between friends, the awkward exchanges between family members, or the sarcastic remarks among coworkers, the humor in these interactions plays a vital role in shaping the comedic tone of the show.  In sitcoms, conversations are not just a means of advancing the plot but are also a tool for generating laughter. Writers carefully craft dialogues that are sharp, outrageous, and relatable to create comedic moments that resonate with the audience. The humor in these conversations can range from subtle innuendos and witty one-liners to absurd situations and over-the-top reactions. What makes sitcom conversations so engaging is the way characters play off each other, using their unique personalities and quirks to generate comedic conflict and resolution.  One of the most common techniques used in sitcom conversations is the setup and punchline format. Characters set up a situation or joke through dialogue, leading to a punchline that delivers the comedic payoff. This classic structure allows for comedic tension to build up, creating anticipation before the punchline lands and elicits laughter from the audience. The timing and delivery of these punchlines are crucial, as they can make or break a joke. Skilled actors and writers work together to ensure that the comedic beats hit just right, maximizing the humor in each exchange.  Moreover, humor in conversations within sitcoms often relies on running gags and callbacks. These recurring jokes or references create a sense of continuity throughout the series, rewarding loyal viewers with inside jokes and a deeper connection to the characters. By revisiting these gags in different contexts or with slight variations, sitcoms can build on previous humor and create a sense of familiarity that delights fans. Running gags also serve as a form of comedic shorthand, allowing writers to quickly establish humor without having to set up new jokes from scratch.  Additionally, situational irony and dramatic irony are commonly used in sitcom conversations to create humor. Situational irony occurs when the outcome of a situation is the opposite of what is expected, leading to comedic misunderstandings or reversals of fortune. Characters may find themselves in absurd predicaments or facing bizarre coincidences that defy logic, resulting in laughter from the audience. On the other hand, dramatic irony occurs when the audience knows something that the characters do not, leading to comical misunderstandings or miscommunications. This form of irony adds layers to conversations, as viewers enjoy watching characters navigate situations with incomplete information.  Furthermore, wordplay and clever dialogue contribute significantly to the humor in sitcom conversations. From puns and double entendres to clever comebacks and witty retorts, wordplay adds a playful element to conversations that delights audiences. Characters who excel at wordplay often become fan favorites, known for their sharp wit and quick thinking. The back-and-forth banter between characters showcases their chemistry and dynamic relationships, drawing viewers into the comedic world of the sitcom.  In addition to verbal humor, physical comedy plays a crucial role in sitcom conversations. Slapstick humor, sight gags, and exaggerated gestures are often used to complement the dialogue and enhance comedic moments. The juxtaposition of witty banter with physical comedy adds depth to the humor in sitcoms, appealing to a broader range of audience preferences. Characters may engage in playful antics, pratfalls, or comedic reactions that amplify the laughs and create memorable moments that viewers recall long after the episode has ended.  Moreover, the use of subtext in conversations within sitcoms adds another layer of humor for astute viewers to enjoy. Subtext refers to the underlying meaning or implication behind what characters say, often contrasting with their explicit words or actions. By subtly hinting at hidden motivations, feelings, or intentions, sitcoms can create humorous situations where characters say one thing but mean another. This form of humor requires viewers to read between the lines and pick up on subtle cues, rewarding them with a deeper appreciation for the comedic writing and performances.  Another aspect of humor in conversations within sitcoms is the incorporation of social commentary and satire. Sitcoms often use humor to address social issues, cultural norms, or current events in a lighthearted and accessible way. Through clever dialogue and witty exchanges, sitcoms can provide insightful commentary on relevant topics while keeping audiences entertained. By using humor as a lens to examine societal issues, sitcoms engage viewers in critical thinking and spark conversations about important issues in an approachable manner.  In conclusion, humor in conversations within sitcoms is a multifaceted and essential component that defines the comedic appeal of these beloved television shows. From witty wordplay and well-timed punchlines to running gags and physical comedy, sitcom conversations are rich with humor that engages audiences and creates memorable moments. By exploring the dynamics between characters, leveraging irony and subtext, and incorporating social commentary, sitcoms use conversations as a vehicle for delivering laughter and entertainment. The art of crafting humorous dialogues that resonate with viewers requires skillful writing, strong performances, and impeccable timing, all of which contribute to the enduring popularity of sitcoms as a beloved genre of television entertainment.""","1091"
"380","""On first appearances one may assume that the city of London, given its problems of plague, over crowdedness, social inequality and presence of 'aliens', was ruled by authorities through fear of unrest. However, on closer examination this assumption appears to be untrue. London was in fact comprised of several smaller organisations, such as companies, who were sensitive to the issues of London's population. Many historians, such as Pearl, argue that it is the sensitivity of these smaller organisations that kept London in order. How did these organisations control London? Was order successfully kept? 'Tudor London was an orderly city until the early 5/880s, but the rapid growth of population thereafter produced serious problems of maintaining public order in both the city and the suburbs.' The population of London doubled between 5/880 to 600, when 00,00 people lived in London, out of a national population of five million. However, by 65/80, London's population had doubled again. This rapid rise in population would have created massive social tensions, such as a polarisation of wealth, over crowdedness causing unsanitary conditions, which would have spread plague during epidemics, and a rise in food prices because there were more people for the same amount of food. Between 5/881 and 602, Manning cites thirty-five outbreaks of disorder and then between 626 and 628 there were fifteen riots of people protesting about the Duke of Buckingham's disastrous policies. 'No part of England was troubled by popular protest to such a degree as London.' Therefore it would seem that if there were attempts to control London's problems, they were unsuccessful. Is this accurate? Manning, R. B Village. 87 Ashton, Robert 'Popular Entertainment and Social Control in later Elizabethan and Early Stuart London' London Journal, p. Manning Village Revolts p. 87 Rappaport argues, in comparison to Manning, that many 'historians have exaggerated the severity of London's problems during the sixteenth century and.have underrated the importance of several factors which promoted stability.' Although, London lacked a good bureaucracy and competent court system, with government bodies meeting infrequently, there were smaller sub-organisations, which played a vital role in keeping order within London. For example, Companies' Courts of Assistants met monthly, weekly or even bi-weekly. These courts were used by rich and poor men alike. The courts dealt with violations of regulations of trade with fines, closure of shop, or worst expulsion from the company. 'Conflict is inevitably part of human society' and in a society as crowded as London, disputes are going to be a common occurrence. However, the courts resolved conflicts between employers and also between employers and employees, and also between families before they got out of control and led to instability in London. For example, a journeyman was expelled from Pewterers' Company for prowling other men's bargins. Similarly, absenteeism, unpaid wages and violations of contract were resolved within these courts. Rappaport, Steve 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part II' London Journal, 0 p. 07 Rappaport 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part II' p. 29 The courts also dealt with serious company offences with public humiliation and sometimes beatings. The threat of punishment meant that a good standard of workmanship was kept within London's crafts and trades and helped maintain order within companies. The company courts provided a flexible framework 'thereby containing much of the social tension which must have otherwise erupted into serious instability.' The high amount the company courts were used shows that they were effective and did help to 'preserve the stability of London in the sixteenth century.' By the middle of the sixteenth century, two thirds of the adult males in London were freemen and belonged to eighty companies, which regulated trade. Therefore, the companies had great control over the population of London and had 'the real and effective power within London's economic structure.' Rappaport 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part II' p. 29 Rappaport 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part II' p. 29 Rappaport 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part II' p. 10 Another thing the companies provided was a respect for authority in London. In order for stability to be maintained, there must be a respect for authority. London achieved this by making elite status obtainable to all; through hard work you could work your way to the top. Livery companies were vital because they controlled access to wealth and power and therefore privilege in society. So another reason people would behave for the companies because they wanted to better themselves. While companies were dealing with conflict, the alderman organised mundane chores to prevent London from becoming a city of ruins, such as fixing gates and cleaning ditches, as part of the social services that the government were trying to provide for London. Not only did this keep London cleaner, it also provided work for people in London, keeping them busy and away from crime. However, the aldermen were not in a position to successfully control London alone. 'Even if London's rulers had wanted to establish a permanent, comprehensive system of social services they lacked the means to do so.' The aldermen did not have a regular system of taxation or a good bureaucracy to implement such ambitious ideas. However, the wards, parishes and the Livery Companies had direct responsibility for collecting taxes, providing an informal network of social organisations who supported the poor and their families. For example, Arthur Banks was very ill in 5/870, he had migrated to London, but wanted to return to his homeland to die. The company courts granted him the money to return home to his family to die. This again illustrates the vital importance of smaller organisations, particularly companies. Feeling a sense of belonging in a town means you will be less likely to commit a crime or cause disorder, because you are happy and feel involved in the community. Many people lacked a sense of belonging in London. Of the number of freemen registered in London, a mere seventeen percent were born in London. So by the end of the sixteenth century, almost everybody in London was a migrant. There were language and dialect problems. With no post office to keep in touch with their families, some migrants felt isolated. Therefore, the 'aliens' or foreigners and people from other parts of England could have conflicted, however, companies gave them a sense of belonging and the courts provided an opportunity for fair discipline. 'Londoners must have felt that the courts were available to them for resolving comparatively minor disputes.' Also, the government in London was highly participatory, meaning it responded well to communal needs. This combined with the caring nature of these smaller organisations and companies provided a sense of community for Londoners, so everyone looked out for each other and thus stability was maintained. Rappaport, Steve 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part I' London Journal, p. 18 Rappaport 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part II' p. 10 Dr Pearl agrees with Rappaport's argument that smaller organisations were the key to control and asserts that the 'view of the City dissolving into administrative chaos, conflict and economic anarchy is too stark and simplistic.' Both Rappaport and Pearl argue that little is known about the social and economic history of London at this time and so to generalise is too simplistic. Many continental cities experienced much instability during the sixteenth century and were ripped apart by Revolution and Civil War, with violent uprisings against the government. For example, the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre against the Huguenots in Paris illustrates how the Reformation was something that caused great conflict in many European cities. Although there was Civil War in England, causing unrest in London, it also caused unrest in other towns across England, so cannot be seen as something solely in London. Dr Pearl in Rappaport 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part I' p. 07 French Protestants In addition, the Crown ensured that the Reformation was not a divisive issue in England. Rappaport's argument for no evidence of riots in London in the sixteenth century, seems to be well founded. There was quarrelling and conflict in London, such as Evil May Day in 5/817, but this particular day seems to figure so prominently in historical reviews not because it was a common event, rather because it was rare. However, this is not to say that Tudor London was an absolutely stable society, without tensions, but problems were dealt with, particularly by company courts, so that violent unrest did not arise. Rappaport 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part I' However, Archer argues that 'the capital was notorious for its criminality.' Many legislators firmly believed there was an organised criminal underworld in London. However, historians, such as Pearl have argued that evidence for belief in a criminal underworld was based on literary sensationalism, such as pamphlets and plays, which were aiming to be entertainment and thus exaggerated the problems of criminality. 'Pamphlets do not demonstrate the existence of a rogue society.but people's determination to believe in one.' Pearl argues that historians have largely overemphasised the idea of urban disorder and their claims that London was a city constantly close to a riot, with criminality as an endemic, is inaccurate. She says that Dorothy George's summary of eighteenth century London as 'combined turbulence with fundamental orderliness', is just as accurate for the century preceding it. This seems a fair description as ultimately crime seems to have been casual and opportunistic, often going hand in hand with the level of poverty. In times of dearth, people stole to survive, for example soldiers returning from war to unemployment. Archer, I The Pursuit of Stability: Social Relations in Elizabethan London p. 04 Archer The Pursuit of Stability p. 06 Pearl, Valerie 'Change and stability in Seventeenth -Century London' London Journal, p. Youths were another group, making up a large percentage of London's population, who could have caused disorder, particularly through crime. For example, if a youth becomes disillusioned with economic prospects, perhaps because of poor quality apprentice instruction, they may turn to crime or rebellion. However, despite Beier's comments that there was large-scale juvenile delinquency in London, there does not seem to have been large-scale gangs of problematic youths in London. This could perhaps be attributed to the alderman's orders that if apprentice riots broke out, curfews would be emplaced and masters would have to answer for the apprentice's behaviour, which would have encouraged the masters to treat their apprentice well. Generally, apprenticeships were a stabilising environment for the youth. They got moral, practical and religious teachings from their masters, as well as keeping them busy and away from crime. Similarly, control of the youth could be attributed to alehouses, theatres, bowling allies, tennis courts, providing social meeting places for the youth, keeping them occupied, away from crime. Although, some historians have argued that these social places could have been a double-edged sword and also provided a gathering place to organise riots, there does not seem to be much evidence to support this. So London dealt with the youth successfully, but what about the poor? They were another group who figured predominantly in London's population and could have caused serious unrest. London is said to have offered the best and the worst of urban worlds in the sixteenth century: a fabulously wealthy elite living cheek by jowl with a thoroughly destitute minority.' London's poor relief system was the most advanced in England. It 'provided for some poor housekeepers and their children not only the statutory weekly doles.also pensions from the guilds and charitable handouts in money and kind from parochial and ward fines and parish fees.' Finaly argues that 'the poor never engineered social uprisings in London,' therefore they must have been reasonably happy with the relief they were given. 'Major cities, such as London, developed institutions precisely to ensure that poverty did not lead to unrest.' London's poverty was contained through numerous strategies. For example, the government aimed to maintain food supplies, so that during times of poor harvests the poor still had food to survive. In 5/870 they set up permanent grain reserves. The companies and wards took much responsibility for government initiatives such as grain reserves. They brought and stored the grain and then during scarcity decided how much to distribute to different families. There were no major grain riots in London during this period, therefore the permanent grain reserves should be seen as a successful venture maintaining control in London. Rappaport 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part I' p. 07 Pearl 'Change and stability in Seventeenth -Century London' p. Finlay, R. and Beier, A. 5/800-. 9 Finlay and 5/800-700 p. 9 There were numerous other government actions to try to control poverty, such as sending vagrants abroad as soldiers, or as indentured servants to the colonies. A key act was the 601 Elizabethan Poor Law. The sick, old, infirm and mentally ill, known as the impotent poor were looked after in poor houses and able bodied poor were sent to workhouses. Those vagrants who refused to work were sent to houses of correction. Also, poor children were given apprenticeships, and thus the opportunity to turn to crime was removed from them. Some hospitals were founded to care for the poor and infirm. Generally in England, there was no consistent body of practice with this Poor Law, however as Rappaport argues, London had one of the best systems of poor relief in England. This could have been because the centre of administration for the Poor Law was in London, therefore any problems were dealt with head on. There were numerous problems with the Elizabethan Poor Law, which were addressed by the Royal Commission, who created a New Poor Law, however this did not happen until 832, so the poor must have been well contained in London to not arouse problems until the nineteenth century. Although many historians, such as Clark and Slack argue for an urban crisis during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, London appears to have escaped large riots or attempts to overthrow the government. This is due mainly to the work of smaller organisations, such as Livery companies, who worked hard to maintain order within the capital. Rappaport concludes that the companies preserved the 'peace within the walls.' Their caring nature seems to have helped provide a sense of community, which is also illustrated by the fact that when the Queen interfered there was a rise in disputes in the capital. 'Social stability depended in neighbourly collaboration with a minimum interference from above.' There were 'many protests against harsh punishments imposed by city magistrates at the Crown's insistence.' Similarly, royal interference became a problem again during the reign of Charles I. If London is compared to other key cities, for example cities in France, then the maintenance of order must be seen as successful. 'Clearly there were problems in the policing of the capital, but they should be kept in perspective.' In his conclusion, Archer states that the authorities had a reasonably well co-ordinated system of policing and they did not collapse before challenges, such as poverty and crime. However, this order only applies to the City of London, the suburbs surrounding London were out of the control of the mayor, companies and aldermen. They were more overcrowded, poorer and more disorderly than the city of London. The suburbs were not as well governed, for example, Cornhill had four constables for two hundred and sixty households and in Portsoken four to five hundred, and in the East suburbs the ratios were even worse. Also, there were no deputy aldermen or links between the overworked justices of the peace and the constables, meaning there was a serious lack of organisation and authority in areas that the city of London held strength in. 'Constables played a crucial part in the maintenance of order.' Similarly, the Commission of the Peace regulated London and prosecuted misdemeanours, such as assault. Rappaport 'Social Structure and Mobility in sixteenth-century London: Part II' p. 12 Finlay and 5/800-700 p. 6 Manning Village Revolts p. 88 Archer The Pursuit of Stability p. 35/8 Archer The Pursuit of Stability p. 20 Archer The Pursuit of Stability p. 21""","""Social control in Tudor London""","3419","""In Tudor London, social control played a crucial role in maintaining order and regulating behavior within the city. During this period from 1485 to 1603, London was a bustling metropolis experiencing rapid growth and transformation, which necessitated mechanisms to manage the increasing population density and diversity of its inhabitants. Social control in Tudor London encompassed a variety of methods and institutions, including legal systems, hierarchical structures, moral regulations, and communal practices that shaped the social fabric of the city.  One of the primary means of social control in Tudor London was the legal system, which sought to uphold law and order through the enforcement of statutes and regulations. The city had its own legal jurisdiction and courts, such as the Court of Aldermen and the Court of Common Council, which dealt with a range of civil and criminal matters affecting the local population. Punishments for offenses varied depending on the severity of the crime and could include fines, imprisonment, public shaming, or even capital punishment for serious offenses.  Law enforcement in Tudor London was carried out by officials such as constables, watchmen, and beadles who patrolled the streets, maintained order, and apprehended wrongdoers. These individuals played a vital role in keeping the peace and ensuring compliance with the law, especially in areas prone to criminal activities or public disturbances. The watch and ward system, for example, involved dividing the city into districts patrolled by watchmen at night to prevent crimes such as theft, vandalism, and public disorder.  Beyond the legal system, social control in Tudor London also relied heavily on hierarchical structures and social norms to regulate behavior and maintain societal harmony. The city was stratified based on social class, and individuals were expected to adhere to the norms and expectations associated with their rank in society. Nobles, merchants, artisans, and laborers each had their own codes of conduct and obligations, which helped reinforce social order and stability within the city.  The Tudor monarchy and nobility played a significant role in exerting social control through their authority and influence over the population. Laws and policies were often dictated by the monarch and implemented through royal proclamations, acts of Parliament, and decrees issued by the Privy Council. The nobility, as landowners and prominent figures in society, also wielded power and influence that extended to their tenants and dependents, thereby shaping behavior and attitudes within their sphere of influence.  Religion was another key aspect of social control in Tudor London, with the Church playing a central role in regulating moral behavior and social practices. The Protestant Reformation under Henry VIII and subsequent monarchs led to the establishment of the Church of England and the dissolution of monasteries, which reshaped the religious landscape of London. Religious authorities, including bishops, clergy, and church courts, enforced religious doctrines, monitored public morality, and punished deviations from orthodox beliefs and practices.  Communal practices and informal social controls also played a vital role in regulating behavior and maintaining order within Tudor London. Communities organized themselves through guilds, parish organizations, and neighborhood associations to address common concerns, resolve disputes, and uphold communal standards. Mutual surveillance, gossip, reputation management, and peer pressure were effective tools for monitoring and disciplining individuals who deviated from societal norms and expectations.  In conclusion, social control in Tudor London was a multifaceted system that encompassed legal, hierarchical, moral, and communal mechanisms to regulate behavior, maintain order, and uphold societal norms. Through the legal system, law enforcement, hierarchical structures, religious institutions, and communal practices, Tudor society sought to manage its population, ensure compliance with rules and regulations, and reinforce the social fabric of the city. This complex interplay of formal and informal controls helped shape the behavior, attitudes, and interactions of individuals within the dynamic urban environment of Tudor London.""","769"
"3145","""I maintain that 'the reality of evil makes it impossible for the God of Classical Theism to exist'. I intend to argue my position by initially providing a definition of the 'problem of evil' and the God of Classical Theism. I will then outline several of the most influential theodicies that have been proposed in response to the problem of evil and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each theodicy to determine whether they are successful in overcoming the problem of evil. Finally I will illustrate how I arrived at my chosen thesis - 'the reality of evil makes it impossible for the God of Classical Theism to exist' as I maintain that due to the extent of evil and suffering that exists in the world God cannot be omnipotent and consequently he cannot be the God of Classical Theism. It is argued that the existence of evil within the world is incompatible with the God of Classical Theism. Evil is categorised into two types - moral evil refers to evil created by humans whilst natural evil refers to evil that is beyond human control. The God of Classical Theism is defined as omnipotent, omniscient and omni-benevolent. The argument for the problem of evil arises as the following statements are incompatible; God is omnipotent, God is omniscient, God is omni-benevolent and evil exists in the world. It is evident that evil exists therefore God cannot exist or cannot posses all of these attributes. If God is omnipotent he has the power to eliminate evil, if God is omniscient he knows about evil and if God is omni-benevolent he has the desire to prevent evil. Vardy, P 'The Puzzle of Evil' London: Collins Flame Gorman, U 'A Good God' Sweden: Hakan Ohlssons Numerous theodicies have been proposed in an attempt to justify the existence of the God of Classical Theism in spite of evil. The Augustinian Theodicy emphasizes the importance of free will when providing an explanation for evil. Augustine presents a Neo-Platonic concept of evil as he rejects the dualistic distinction of good and evil and considers evil to be a privation of good as opposed to an entity in itself. Augustine maintained that God gave humans free will because freedom is necessary for humans to freely choose to love God and to do good. Augustine refers to the biblical Fall of humanity to account for the presence of evil as humans deliberately turned away from God. Moral and natural evil are the consequence for human sin. Hick, J 'Evil and the God of Love' Basingstoke: MacMillan Vardy, P 'The Puzzle of Evil' London: Collins Flame The significance of free will is also emphasised by the Irenaean Theodicy which identifies evil as playing a valuable role in Gods plan for humans. Two stages of human creation are acknowledged. Humans are imperfect yet capable of spiritual and moral growth as they have been created in the 'image of God'. Through the exercise of free action humans are able to transform into the 'children of God'. Freedom is necessary for humans to become the kind of creatures God intended and to freely love him however some used their free will to reject God and do what is good. Swinburne maintained evil is necessary for the reality of human freedom by presenting us with choices between good and evil and is essential for the creation of 'greater goods'. A world without evil is a world without forgiveness, bravery, compassion and self-sacrifice. Evil is essential for the exercise of goodness as it allows humans to perform at their best. Consequently, evil becomes a good in itself. Clack and Clack 'The Philosophy of Religion: A Critical Introduction' Polity Press: Oxford The 'soul-making' theodicy presented by Hick argues that humans are still in the process of creation and evil is a necessary endurance in the struggle for perfection. The world is a 'soul-making' place presenting us with the opportunity to develop into the 'children of God'. Eschatological verification is used as Hick argues that all evil will be resolved in the afterlife. The 'principle of plentitude' maintains that the most prosperous universe encompasses every possible kind of existence including lower and higher. In the sight of God all things combine to form a wonderful harmony, this includes sin. Tooley, M Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy: The Problem of Evil retrieved on 0th November 006 from the World Wide Web: URL Hick, J 'Evil and the God of Love' Basingstoke: MacMillan The Process Theodicy presented by Whitehead redefines the understanding of God and presents his as 'bi-polar' (both abstract and solid etc). God depends on the personal experiences of humans to create the solid aspect of his nature. Evil is not governed by God; it arises from free choices of humans. God's power is redefined as the outcome of creation is dependant upon the extent that humans decide to assist God therefore the responsibility of evil is no longer Gods. God is not omnipotent, he is bound by natural laws therefore he cannot prevent evil. Griffin maintained this approach 'dissolves the problem of evil by denying the doctrine of omnipotence fundamental to it'. God doesn't direct evil but shares in human suffering. Clack and Clack 'The Philosophy of Religion: A Critical Introduction' Polity Press: Oxford Griffin cited in Clack and Clack 'The Philosophy of Religion: A Critical Introduction' Polity Press: Oxford Several criticisms have been raised in response to Augustine's theodicy. I adopt the view presented by Schleiermacher that Augustine's theodicy is logically flawed as the concept of a perfect world corrupting itself is self-contradictory. The conception of an unqualifiedly good creature committing sin is incomprehensible, if angels are finitely perfect they will never sin despite being free to do so, if they do sin they cannot have been flawless implying that God as their creator must share responsibility for their Fall. It has been argued that the emphasis on the Fall and the self creation of evil 'ex nihilo' is conflicting as if God created a perfect world it is not evident how evil could arise, however I do not find this to weaken the theodicy as Augustine does not maintain that evil is created 'ex nihilo' rather that it is not created at all as it is a lack of something not an entity in itself. As Hell is considered to be part of God's initial design then he must have anticipated that the world would corrupt. Scientific advancement has also hindered the Augustinian theodicy as it would appear due to evolution that humans are in fact striving towards perfection, not away from it. Hick, J 'Evil and the God of Love' Basingstoke: MacMillan Weaknesses of the Irenaean theodicy have also been identified. Flew and Mackie are successful in criticising the theodicy as they argue that humans with the same degree of freedom vary in their ability to sin, therefore God could have made humans so that they always freely choose what is right. They give the example of a saint and a depraved human, it is logically possible for the saint to sin but morally impossible, similarly it is logically possible for the depraved human to not sin but morally impossible. God could have created perfect humans that were free to sin but remained sinless. Smart retaliates by criticising what he referred to as the 'Utopia thesis' as concepts e.g. good are linked to other concepts e.g. courage, temptation etc. The perception of goodness would be meaningless if there were no experiences of temptation and no circumstance for one to choose good above evil - a morally untemptable being could not be thought of as good. I do not find this to overcome Flew and Mackie's criticism as they suggesting the creation of beings that still experience temptation but are sufficiently more resilient to it, not beings that experience no temptation at all. Even if one accepts evil as the result of free will being misused, this only accounts for moral evil and does not provide explanation for the existence of natural evil. In addition to this criticism the proposition of heaven for all individuals regardless of their actions seems unjust and the extreme amount of suffering is unacceptable and unnecessary for humans to become like God. Hick, J 'Evil and the God of Love' Basingstoke: MacMillan Vardy, P 'The Puzzle of Evil' London: Collins Flame In response to Hick's argument human experiences can be 'soul-breaking' questioning the justification of God as creator. Hick responds to this by maintaining the process of soul-making continues after death in a realm where the subject will grow and develop and will be able to understand the meaning of suffering endured in the world. I do not condone this concept of a 'higher harmony' as the presence of evil in this world is justified by eradicating suffering in a future world. This consequently questions the meaning of this world and implies we should not combat present evil as it will be righted in the future. This could lead to inaction and indifference towards others' suffering. Hick's theodicy does not account for those who die young as they do not have the chance to overcome suffering and develop morally, the theodicy also fails to account for the unequal distribution of suffering as some people experience minimal suffering therefore nothing challenges them to undergo moral growth. Hick also relies heavily on the belief of an afterlife which is constantly debated. Clack and Clack 'The Philosophy of Religion: A Critical Introduction' Polity Press: Tooley, M Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy: The Problem of Evil retrieved on 0th November 006 from the World Wide Web: URL The Process Theodicy has been criticised by questioning the point of human efforts if God cannot guarantee anything. I do not regard this to be a sufficient criticism as it is not necessary for there to be any specific reason for human life. It has also been argued that the Process Theodicy is only satisfactory for those whose lives have been wholly good however it is not sufficient for those whose lives has been filled with suffering. However, I maintain that if God is not omnipotent, he would not be able to control/influence which people are affected by extreme evil. Some argue that removing God's omnipotence renders him senile yet I do not find this to be the case as God will still significantly be the most powerful being in the universe. By reducing God's power the God of Classical Theism is denied. Fetteroll, D 'The Problem of Evil and Suffering' retrieved on 7 November 006 from the World Wide Web: URL Ultimately, theodicies that have been proposed have failed to disprove the claim 'the reality of evil makes it impossible for the God of Classical Theism to exist'. Augustine's theodicy commits a logical contradiction in the notion of a perfect world becoming corrupt whilst the Irenaean theodicy does not give sufficient reason why God could not have created free beings that always chose to do good and never sin. The extreme amount of evil is unnecessary for humans to grow and develop and does not account for the enormously unfair distribution of suffering within the world. Acceptance of Hicks response to the problem of evil results in debate about the existence of an afterlife and also inaction against/acceptance of present evil. Alternatively the Process theodicy overcomes criticisms raised against it and is sufficient in arguing the existence of a God in spite of evil by rejecting God's omnipotence and consequently the God of Classical Theism. In conclusion I agree that 'the reality of evil makes it impossible for the God of Classical Theism to exist' however as the Process theodicy has demonstrated it is possible for a less powerful God and the reality of evil to co-exist within the world. Annotated Bibliography. Clack and Clack 'The Philosophy of Religion: A Critical Introduction' Polity Press: OxfordThis book was one of the most helpful sources and was a very useful introduction to the problem of evil. It was very easy to read and to understand as the arguments were presented clearly. The opening paragraph of the chapter 'Challenges to Theism' was particularly effective in demonstrating the existence of evil and suffering in the world. This book initially stated what was meant by the problem of evil and included all of the theodicies that I mentioned in my essay - the Augustinian Theodicy, Irenaean Theodicy, the Process Theodicy and Hick's concept of soul-making, and provided strengths and weaknesses regarding each argument. Fetteroll, D 'The Problem of Evil and Suffering' retrieved on 7 th November 006 from the World Wide Web: URL I found this website to be adequate in addressing the problem of evil. It outlined what is meant by the problem of evil and provided a brief overview of a variety of responses to the problem. All of the theodicies that I chose to include within my essay were addressed and the criticisms that had been raised against them were addressed. However the aspects of each argument/criticism were not explored in depth. Also because this source was a website I was reluctant to use any new information that it provided that could not be confirmed by my other sources in case it was unreliable. Go rman, U 'A Good God' Sweden: Ha kan OhlssonsI briefly used this book for initially defining the problem of evil however I did not find it to be particularly useful as the book tended to focus on Flew and Mackie's criticism of the free will defence. I found my other sources to be considerably more useful when outlining and critiquing theodicies. In addition to Flew and Mackie's criticisms of the free will defence this book also mentions Plantinga's argument from all 'possible worlds' however I did not have enough room to include Plantinga's viewpoint in my essay due to the word limit. Despite not being particularly useful this book was understandable and easy to read. Hick, J 'Evil and the God of Love' Basingstoke: MacmillanThis book was fairly useful for obtaining information regarding the problem of evil. Hick provides an in-depth discussion with reference to the Augustinian and Irenaean theodicies and was particularly helpful in providing criticisms that have been raised in response to each one. Obviously, the book was also useful in providing insight into Hick's own viewpoint, that the problem of evil can be overcome as the world is a 'soul-making' place. Despite containing plenty of information it was very difficult to pinpoint key information due to the length of the text. Also, I found this book harder to read and to understand than most of the other sources that I used. Tooley, M Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy: The Problem of Evil retrieved on 0 th November 006 from the World Wide Web: URL I found this website to be helpful with regard to the problem of evil as it provided a comprehensive account of the problem evil poses for the existence of God. The contents of the document were clearly stated which made it very easy to find the information that was relevant to me as much of the webpage addressed aspects of the problem of evil that I did not include in my essay. This website was most useful for criticising Hick's 'soul-making' theodicy as a variety of criticisms were presented. Once again because this source was a website I was reluctant to use information that could not be confirmed by my other sources in case it was unreliable. Vardy, P 'The Puzzle of Evil' London: Collins FlameThis book was incredibly useful as it outlined the main arguments for the problem of evil clearly and concisely. Vardy examined what evil is and defined the problem of evil. This book was particularly helpful in criticising the free will defence. Vardy rejects evil being viewed as a greater good. He refers to both natural and moral evil which was helpful as a lot of books only focus on moral evil. It is evident that Vardy believes in the existence of God in spite of the problem of evil, yet he does not believe that the arguments raised in response to evil are successful in overcoming it. The main drawback to 'The Puzzle of Evil' is that it was difficult to identify the main points to include as due to the word limit of the essay I could not include all of the arguments/criticisms that were presented. Module U73630: The Philosophy of Religion""","""Problem of evil and theism""","3361","""The """"problem of evil"""" is a philosophical dilemma that has long challenged the concept of theism, particularly the idea of an all-powerful and benevolent God coexisting with the presence of evil and suffering in the world. This complex theological question has sparked intense debates among theologians, philosophers, and scholars for centuries. In exploring this topic, we delve into the nature of evil, the traditional arguments surrounding the existence of evil and a loving God, and various responses offered by theistic traditions to address this profound challenge.  Evil, in the context of the problem of evil, is often defined as any form of suffering, pain, or moral wrongdoing that causes harm or distress to individuals or the world at large. The existence of evil raises fundamental questions about the nature of God and His attributes, particularly focusing on the qualities of omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence traditionally ascribed to the God of monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.  One of the classic formulations of the problem of evil is the logical problem of evil, which posits that the coexistence of a supposedly all-powerful and all-loving God with the existence of evil is logically incompatible. The argument goes that if God is truly all-powerful, He should be able to prevent evil; if He is all-loving, He would desire to eliminate evil; yet, evil exists. This seeming contradiction challenges the traditional understanding of God's nature and His relationship to His creation.  To grapple with this philosophical conundrum, theologians and philosophers have proposed various responses and solutions. One common approach is known as theodicy, which seeks to justify or explain the presence of evil in a world created by a benevolent deity. Theodicies come in different forms, aiming to reconcile the existence of evil with the existence of God. Some theodicies argue that evil is a necessary counterpart to the existence of free will, positing that true moral agency requires the possibility of choosing between good and evil. This perspective suggests that God allows evil to exist as a consequence of granting humans the freedom to make their own choices.  Another theodicy emphasizes the concept of soul-making, suggesting that suffering and adversity play a crucial role in the development and refinement of individuals' moral and spiritual character. According to this view, overcoming challenges and experiencing hardships can lead to personal growth, empathy, and a deeper understanding of the human condition. From this perspective, evil is seen as a catalyst for personal and spiritual transformation rather than a purely negative force.  Furthermore, some theistic traditions propose that the presence of evil can be understood within a broader framework of divine providence and a greater cosmic plan. According to this view, God's ways are beyond human comprehension, and what may appear as evil or suffering from a limited human perspective may serve a higher purpose in the grand scheme of creation. Believers in this perspective often find solace in trusting that God's wisdom surpasses human understanding and that there is a divine purpose behind seemingly senseless acts of evil.  In addition to the philosophical and theological responses to the problem of evil, some religious traditions offer practical guidance on how to navigate and respond to suffering and evil in the world. For example, in Christianity, the concept of redemptive suffering is central to understanding the role of suffering in the life of believers. The idea that Christ's suffering on the cross brought about redemption for humanity underscores the transformative power of suffering when viewed through a lens of faith and salvation.  Moreover, the notion of solidarity with the suffering is a common theme in many religious teachings, emphasizing the importance of compassion, empathy, and social justice in response to the presence of evil in the world. From this perspective, individuals are called to alleviate the suffering of others, work towards a more just and equitable society, and embody the values of love and compassion in the face of adversity.  While the problem of evil remains a profound philosophical challenge to theistic beliefs, it also invites individuals to engage in deep reflection on the nature of suffering, free will, and divine providence. The exploration of this topic encourages critical thinking, ethical inquiry, and a search for meaning in the midst of a world marked by both beauty and brokenness. Ultimately, the problem of evil prompts individuals to wrestle with the complexities of existence, grapple with deep existential questions, and seek paths towards spiritual growth and moral clarity in the face of life's inherent challenges.""","889"

Since culture is protected and fostered more strongly in France than in Italy, I can't say the French miss out on a profitable, however short-lived, opportunity: readers would probably be put off by cheap 'allegati', as much as the publishers. Google printThe SNE is obviously more defensive of the tradition and culture of books than the Italian AIE: it will probably soon act against Google for scanning French titles, although putting content online has improved sales in similar situations. Apart from the reaction of the publishers in different countries, international marketers must consider how readers view the opportunity of checking books online, and possibly downloading them (legally or not). Book-buyers will typically split into four categories, according to technological skills and ethics about books. The proportion of those categories will reflect the country's general attitudes in the culture-commerce debate: who thinks it would be distasteful to steal a book, more than any other anonymous commodity? Who thinks books are worth paying? Bookcrossing'An innovative attempt to make 'the whole world a library'', according to founders and fans, bookcrossing encourages book reading and buying (many members buy two copies so they have one to keep), and therefore is beneficial for sales. Some authors complain the system robs them of royalties (which they'd receive for sales of new books, or library lending rights in some countries), but most approve of this model, which strips books of their economic value and celebrates them as purely cultural objects. At least in theory, and in the small scale of a niche phenomenon, bookcrossing actually carries economic potential: like used-book stores and libraries, it's a relatively painless 'entry level' for experimenting with titles peer-recommendation gives obscure authors the chance to gain visibility the website links through to booksellers' websites. Bookcrossers are a compact globalised segment of the market, efficiently reachable through the website which is the base of their community. They are book-lovers and heavy buyers, representing a goldmine for international publishers willing to target people agreeing that any money spent on books is nothing compared to their cultural value. Reading campaignsOther initiatives based on books having cultural value, but which also promote sales, are reading campaigns in the US and UK (amidst a plethora of events such as World Book Day and book prizes). The ideological affinity with the bookcrossing community is proved by the latter's perfectly integrated involvement at times (bookcrossers distribute copies of the selected title for the campaign and track them online ). Books distributed free, or discounted, within these initiatives don't risk the devaluation feared by the SNE about 'allegati', because the campaign has a recognised cultural meaning. Less-known titles are pushed into the market, and selected one-book campaign titles are granted a revival. Publishers obtain priceless promotion by participating in a community activity, which intelligently stresses reading instead of buying. In other words, their marketers are brilliantly using the perceived cultural value of books in order to reach their economic objectives.""","""International Publishing and Market Trends""","1218","""International publishing has undergone significant transformations in recent years, driven by technological advancements, changes in consumer behavior, and global market trends. The publishing industry encompasses a wide range of formats, including books, magazines, journals, and digital content, and operates on a global scale with publishers from various countries contributing to the vibrant landscape of literature and knowledge dissemination.  One of the most notable trends in international publishing is the rise of digital publishing. With the widespread adoption of e-readers, tablets, and smartphones, digital content has become increasingly popular among readers worldwide. E-books, audiobooks, and online platforms have opened up new opportunities for publishers to reach a global audience and distribute content more efficiently. This shift towards digital publishing has also impacted traditional print publishing, leading to changes in distribution methods and marketing strategies.  Another key trend in international publishing is the growing importance of diverse voices and representation in literature. Readers are increasingly seeking out books and content that reflect a variety of perspectives, cultures, and experiences. Publishers are responding to this demand by actively seeking out diverse authors and stories, and incorporating themes of diversity and inclusion into their publishing programs. This trend not only enriches the literary landscape but also promotes greater understanding and empathy among readers from different backgrounds.  Globalization has also played a significant role in shaping international publishing trends. With the ease of book distribution across borders and the rise of international book fairs and festivals, publishers have greater access to foreign markets than ever before. This has led to an increase in translated works, with books from different languages and cultures being made available to readers worldwide. Cross-border collaborations between publishers have also become more common, enabling the exchange of ideas and the dissemination of literature on a global scale.  In terms of genres, certain trends have emerged in international publishing that reflect changing reader preferences. While perennial favorites such as fiction and non-fiction continue to be popular, there has been a rise in genres such as young adult fiction, self-help, and fantasy. The success of book-to-screen adaptations has also influenced publishing trends, with publishers actively seeking out books that have the potential for multimedia adaptations to cater to a broader audience.  The role of independent publishers should not be overlooked when discussing international publishing trends. Independent publishers play a crucial role in promoting innovative and niche literature that may not fit within the traditional publishing model. They often champion emerging authors, experimental writing styles, and marginalized voices, contributing to the diversity and richness of the publishing industry. In an era dominated by commercial giants, independent publishers offer a much-needed alternative for readers seeking unique and unconventional content.  In conclusion, international publishing is a dynamic and constantly evolving industry that is shaped by a variety of trends and factors. From the rise of digital publishing to the emphasis on diversity and representation, the landscape of global publishing is diverse and multifaceted. Publishers around the world are adapting to these trends to stay relevant and engage with readers in an increasingly interconnected world. By embracing innovation, collaboration, and inclusivity, international publishing will continue to thrive and evolve in the years to come.""","603"
"3076","""Health promotion aims to combat a vast range of behaviours that are deemed to be detrimental to our health. The majority of health promotion tools focus on the problems that can be brought on by our own behaviour, such as heart type II concerned with the emotional and physical well being of children, and specifically on reducing the threat to children from their own family. This essay will explain why it is important to give children a safe upbringing, why the resource was chosen, how it was designed, who it is targeted at, where it should be displayed, whether or not it would be successful and examines the government policies that support it. My health promotion poster does not aim to tackle a disease, but it does promote healthy behaviour. Blaxter argues that 'health can be defined negatively as the absence of illness, functionally, as the ability to cope with every day activities, or positively as fitness and wellbeing' (Blaxter, 001, in Purdy & Banks, 001, p185/8). It is a nurse's responsibility to ensure that all children reach their potential and my poster aims it to create physical and psychological wellbeing by removing a child from the harm that both physical and emotional abuse or neglect can it is better for the child than making no order at all. (Northants Child Protection Committee, 004). As the Department for Education and Skills website explains, The Department of Health, Department for Education and Skills and the Home Office jointly issued guidance as to how professional groups and services should co-operate to safeguard children. Local authorities were to ensure that an Area Child Protection their area was set up, bringing together representatives of the agencies and professionals responsible for helping to protect children from abuse and neglect. The Northants Child Protection Committee is an example of this and its roles and responsibilities are listed in the document referenced in this essay. The document starts by explaining the legal framework based on the Children Act. The legal provisions such as the 'Emergency Protection Order' or 'Care Order' are listed, followed by definitions of child abuse and then the roles and responsibilities of the Northamptonshire Review and Conference Service. In 003 the Department of Health published 'what to do if you are worried a child is being abused'. The document is aimed at anyone who has concerns about a child. It states that you should discuss your concern with a colleague or manager, without necessarily identifying the child. If your concerns persist you should make a referral to social services, the police or the NSPCC. Interestingly it says that you should discuss your concerns with the their family and seek their agreement before making a has four definitions of harm. Significant harm is ill treatment or the impairment. The other forms of abuse are physical, sexual or emotional order to make the action. The health visitor may then be able to prepare the child emotionally for the massive change that their call for help will bring about. Beattie designed a framework that explained the relationship between different forms of health negotiated (at a local level - between health professionals and the public). My poster combines both. The poster itself would be the result of government initiatives on child protection. Once the poster is responded to the health visitor would be able to offer personal counselling. I was conscious when examining the behaviour change models that it is hard to reconcile them with the decision to report abuse and also that abuse is quite unlike the addictive behaviours the models are designed to address. I did manage to satisfy myself that there are some similarities. People who have a poor diet and over eat may have poor self esteem due to their obesity and understand that they are at risk of heart disease and diabetes, but persist with their unhealthy habits. They may wish to adopt a healthier lifestyle but not have the will power to achieve this. In the same way, a child who is being abused may understand that the abuse is wrong and causing them harm, but may not report it. This could be because they have never known any other way, or they may be afraid of the consequences. I hope that my poster is a plausible effort at using psychological models to affect change. The images on my poster were sourced from the Alamy images website. I typed the words 'moody teenager' and 'health visitor' into the search engine and chose the images. I wanted to avoid pictures of violent acts or anything too confrontational. I am very happy with the image of the girl crying into her pillow as it complements the words 'having problems at home?' I was pleased to discover on viewing the Northamptonshire County Council child protection web pages that my choice was vindicated as they have chosen some very similar images. By not being specific about types of abuse the poster shows that any problem can be discussed. The problem with my poster is that it is very specific about who to call. I could have mentioned the school nurse or given the child line number, but decided that I wanted to alert the child to the fact that they can contact someone who they probably would never associate with child protection. This essay has examined the definition of health, problems that child abuse can cause, the government initiatives that aim to combat it, why and how I chose to design my poster and the health promotion models that explain the rationale. Child abuse is a problem that we must all be aware of. We should be vigilant and report any suspicions we have about the wellbeing of a child. My poster recognises that people are often unaware of the important role that the health visitor has in child protection proceedings and aims to let children know that a friendly and caring health care professional is only a phone call away.""","""Child health promotion and protection""","1114","""Child health promotion and protection are vital aspects of ensuring the well-being and development of children worldwide. From infancy to adolescence, safeguarding the health of children is essential for their present and future. It involves a holistic approach that encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being. By focusing on preventive measures, education, advocacy, and creating supportive environments, child health promotion and protection play a crucial role in laying the foundation for a healthy and prosperous society.  Starting from the early years of a child's life, promoting proper nutrition is key to their growth and development. Breastfeeding, often referred to as the """"gold standard"""" of infant nutrition, provides essential nutrients and antibodies that protect against infections and diseases. Encouraging a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins establishes healthy eating habits that can last a lifetime. Educating parents and caregivers on the importance of nutritional choices can significantly impact a child's overall health.  Regular physical activity is another cornerstone of child health promotion. Encouraging children to engage in age-appropriate activities not only improves their physical health but also boosts their cognitive function and emotional well-being. Limiting sedentary behaviors such as excessive screen time is equally crucial in preventing obesity and related health issues. By promoting active play and sports participation, children can develop lifelong habits that support a healthy lifestyle.  Ensuring access to quality healthcare services is fundamental in protecting children's health. Routine check-ups, vaccinations, and timely interventions are essential in preventing illnesses and monitoring growth and development. Vaccinations, in particular, are one of the most effective ways to protect children from serious infectious diseases. By following recommended immunization schedules, parents can safeguard their children and contribute to community immunity, preventing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.  Mental health is an integral part of child well-being that often goes unnoticed. Promoting mental wellness involves providing a supportive environment where children feel safe to express their feelings and seek help when needed. Addressing stress, anxiety, and other mental health challenges early on can prevent long-term issues and promote resilience. Educating parents, teachers, and caregivers on recognizing signs of mental health concerns is crucial in ensuring early intervention and support.  Protection from harm and exploitation is a fundamental right of every child. Safeguarding children from abuse, neglect, violence, and exploitation is paramount in promoting their health and well-being. Training caregivers, teachers, and healthcare providers on recognizing and reporting child abuse is essential in creating a protective environment for children. Establishing support systems and services for children who have experienced trauma is crucial in helping them heal and thrive.  Educating children about personal safety, including teaching them about boundaries, consent, and healthy relationships, empowers them to protect themselves from potential harm. By fostering open communication and teaching children to assert their rights, we equip them with the tools to stay safe and seek help when needed. Creating a culture of respect and empathy not only promotes healthy relationships but also prevents bullying and other forms of violence among children.  Government policies, community initiatives, and advocacy efforts play a pivotal role in promoting child health and protection on a broader scale. Investing in public health programs, social services, and educational campaigns can have a significant impact on improving children's well-being. By advocating for policies that prioritize child health, stakeholders can create a supportive environment that enables every child to thrive.  In conclusion, child health promotion and protection are multifaceted endeavors that require collaboration and commitment from various stakeholders. By prioritizing preventive measures, providing access to quality healthcare, promoting mental wellness, and safeguarding children from harm, we can create a nurturing environment where every child has the opportunity to grow and flourish. Investing in the health and well-being of children is an investment in a healthier, more equitable future for all.""","752"
