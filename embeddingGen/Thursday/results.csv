Clodd__Edward,39526_PioneersofEvolution.txt,0,"rine of his redemption--the keystone of the fabric. It has penetrated the mists of antiquity, and traced the myth of a forfeited Paradise, of the Creation, the Deluge, and other legends, to their birthplaces in the valley of the Euphrates or the uplands of Persia; legends whose earliest inscribed records are on Accadian tablets, or in the scriptures of Zarathustra. It has in the spirit of the commended Bereans, ""searched"" those and other scriptures, finding therein legends of founders of ancient faiths cognate to those which in the course of the centuries gathered round Jesus of Nazareth; it has collated the rites and ceremonies of many a barbaric theology with those of old-world religions--Brahmanic, Buddhistic, Christian--and found only such differences between them as are referable to the higher or the lower culture. For the history of superstitions is included in the history of beliefs; the superstitions being the germ-plasm of which all beliefs above the lowest are the modified products. Belief incarnates itself in word or act. In the one we have the charm, the invocation, and the dogma; in the other the ritual and ceremony. ""A ritual system,"" Professor Robertson Smith remarks, ""must always remain materialistic, even if its materialism is disguised under the cloak of mysticism."" And it is with the incarnated ideas, uninfluenced by the particular creed in connection with which it finds them, that anthropology deals. Its method is that of biology. Without bias, without assumptions of relative truth or falsity, the anthropologist searches into origins, traces variations, compares and classifies, and relates the several families to one ordinal group. He must be what was said of Dante, ""a theologian to whom no dogma is foreign."" Unfortunately, this method, whose application to the physical sciences is unchallenged, is, when applied to beliefs, regarded as one of attack, instead of being one of explanation. But this should not deter; and if in analyzing a belief we kill a superstition, this does but show what mortality lay at its core. For error cannot survive dissection. Moreover, as John Morley puts it, ""to tamper with veracity is to tamper with the vital force of human progress."" Therefore, delivering impartial judgment, the verdict of anthropology upon the whole matter is that the claims of Christian theologians to a special and divine origin of their religion are refuted by the accordant evidence of the latest utterances of a science whose main concern is with the origin, nature, and destiny of man. The extension of the comparative method to the various products of man's intellectual and spiritual nature is the logical sequence to the adoption of that method throughout every department of the universe. Of course it starts with the assumption of differences in things, else it would be superfluous. But it equally starts with the assumption of resemblances, and in every case it has brought out the fact that the differences are superficial, and that the resemblances are fundamental. All this bears closely on Huxley's work. The impulse thereto has come largely from the evidence focussed in Man's Place in Nature, evidence of which the material of the writings of his later years is the expansion. The cultivation of intellect and character had always been a favourite theme with him, and the interest was widened when the passing of Mr. Forster's Elementary Education Act in 1870 brought the problem of popular culture to the front. The wave of enthusiasm carried a group of distinguished liberal candidates to the polls, and Huxley was elected a member of the School Board for London. Then, although in not so acute a form as now, the religious difficulty was the sole cause of any serious division, and Huxley's attitude therein puzzled a good many people because he advocated the retention of the Bible in the schools. Those who should have known him better thought that he was (to quote from one of his letters to the writer) ""a hypocrite, or simply a fool."" ""But,"" he adds, ""my meaning was that the mass of the people should not be deprived of the one great literature which is open to them, nor shut out from the perception of its place in the whole past history of civilised mankind."" He lamented, as every thoughtful person must lament, the decay of Bible reading in this generation, while, at the same time, he advocated the more strenuously its detachment from the glosses and theological inferences which do irreparable injury to a literature whose value cannot be overrated. For Huxley was well read in history, and therefore he would not trust the clergy as interpreters of the Bible. After repeating in the Prologue to his Essays on Controverted Questions what he had said about the book in his article on the School Boards in Critiques and Addresses, he adds, ""I laid stress on the necessity of placing such instruction in lay hands; in the hope and belief that it would thus gradually accommodate itself to the coming changes of opinion; that the theology and the legend would drop more and more out of sight, while the perennially interesting historical, literary, and ethical contents would come more and more into view."" Subsequent events have justified neither the hope nor the belief. Had Huxley lived to see that all the sectaries, while quarrelling as to the particular dogmas which may be deduced from the Bible, agree in refusing to use it other than as an instrument for the teaching of dogma, he would probably have come to see that the only solution in the interests of the young, is its exclusion from the schools. Never has any collection of writings, whose miscellaneous, unequal, and often disconnected character is obscured by the common title ""Bible"" which covers them, had such need for deliverance from the so-called ""believers"" in it. Its value is only to be realized in the degree that theories of its inspiration are abandoned. Then only is it possible to treat it like any other literature of the kind; to discriminate between the coarse and barbaric features which evidence the humanness of its origin, and the loftier features of its later portions which also evidence how it falls into line with other witnesses of man's gradual ethical and spiritual development. Huxley's breadth of view, his sympathy with every branch of culture, his advocacy of literary in unison with scientific training, fitted him supremely for the work of the School Board, but its demands were too severe on a man never physically strong, and he was forced to resign. However, he was thereby set free for other work, which could be only effectively done by exchanging the arena for the study. The earliest important outcome of that relief was the monograph on Hume, published in 1879, and the latest was the Romanes lecture on Evolution and Ethics, which was delivered in the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford on the 18th of May, 1893. Between the two lie a valuable series of papers dealing with the Evolution of Theology and cognate subjects. In all these we have the application of the theory of Evolution to the explanation of the origin of beliefs and of the basis of morals. To quote the saying attributed to Leibnitz, both Spencer and Huxley, and all who follow them, care for ""science only because it enables them to speak with authority in philosophy and religion."" In a letter to the writer, wherein Huxley refers to his retirement from official life, he says:-- I was so ill that I thought with Hamlet, ""the rest is silence."" But my wiry constitution has unexpectedly weathered the storm, and I have every reason to believe that with renunciation of the devil and all his works (i. e., public speaking, dining, and being dined, etc.) my faculties may be unimpaired for a good spell yet. And whether my lease is long or short, I mean to devote them to the work I began in the paper on the Evolution of Theology. That essay was first published in two sections in the Nineteenth Century, 1886, and was the sequel to the eighth chapter of his Hume. The Romanes Lecture supplemented the last chapter of that book. All these are accessible enough to render superfluous any abstract of their contents. But the tribute due to David Hume, who may well-nigh claim place among the few but fit company of Pioneers, warrants reference to his anticipation of accepted theories of the origin of belief in spiritual beings in his Natural History of Religion, published in 1757. He says: ""There is an universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like themselves, and to transfer to every object those qualities with which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately conscious.... The unknown causes which continually employ their thought, appearing always in the same aspect, are all apprehended to be of the same kind or species. Nor is it long before we ascribe to them thought, and reason, and passion, and sometimes even the limbs and figures of men, in order to bring them nearer to a resemblance with ourselves."" In his address to the Sorbonne on The Successive Advances of the Human Mind, delivered in 1750, Turgot expresses the same idea, touching, as John Morley says in his essay on that statesman, ""the root of most of the wrong thinking that has been as a manacle to science."" The foregoing, and passages of a like order, are made by Huxley the text of his elaborations of the several stages of theological evolution, the one note of all of which is the continuity of belief in supernatural intervention. But more important than the decay of that belief which is the prelude to decay of belief in deity itself as commonly defined, is the resulting transfer of the foundation of morals, in other words, of motives to conduct, from a theological to a social base. Theology is not morality; indeed, it is, too often, immorality. It is concerned with man's relations to the gods in whom he believes; while morals are concerned with man's relations to his fellows. The one looks heavenward, wondering what dues shall be paid the gods to win their smiles or ward off their frowns. In old Rome sanctitas or holiness, was, according to Cicero, ""the knowledge of the rites which had to be performed."" These done, the gods were expected to do their part. So in new Rome, when the Catholic has attended mass, his share in the contract is ended. Worship and sacrifice, as mere acts toward supernatural beings, may be consonant with any number of lapses in conduct. Morality, on the other hand, looks earthward, and is prompted to action solely by what is due from a man to his fellow-men, or from his fellow-men to him. Its foundation therefore is not in supernatural beliefs, but in social instincts. All sin is thus resolved into an anti-social act: a wrong done by man to man. This is not merely readjustment; it is revolution. For it is the rejection of theology with its appeals to human obligation to deity, and to man's hopes of future reward or fears of future punishment; and it is the acceptance of wholly secular motives as incentives to right action. Those motives, having their foundation in the physical, mental, and moral results of our deeds, rest on a stable basis. No longer interlaced with the unstable theological, they neither abide nor perish with it. And one redeeming feature of our time is that the churches are beginning to see this, and to be effected by it. John Morley caustically remarks that ""the efforts of the heterodox have taught them to be better Christians than they were a hundred years ago."" Certain extremists excepted, they are keeping dogma in the background, and are laying stress on the socialism which it is contended was at the heart of the teaching of Jesus. Wisely, if not very consistently, they are seeking alliance with the liberal movements whose aim is the ""abolition of privilege."" The liberal theologians, in the face of the varying ethical standards which mark the Old Testament and the New, no longer insist on the absoluteness of moral codes, and so fall into line with the evolutionist in his theory of their relativeness. For society in its advance from lower to higher conceptions of duty, completely reverses its ethics, looking back with horror on that which was once permitted and unquestioned. It is with this checking of ""the ape and tiger,"" and this fostering of the ""angel"" in man, that Huxley dealt in his Romanes Lecture. There was much unintelligent, and some wilful, misunderstanding of his argument, else a prominent Catholic biologist would hardly have welcomed it as a possible prelude to Huxley's submission to the Church. Yet the reasoning was clear enough, and in no wise contravened the application of Evolution to morals. Huxley showed that Evolution is both cosmical and ethical. Cosmic Evolution has resulted in the universe with its non-living and living contents, and since, dealing with the conditions which obtain on our planet, there is not sufficient elbow-room or food for all the offspring of living things, the result is a furious struggle in which the strong win and transmit their advantages to their descendants. Nature is wholly selfish; the race is to the swift, and the battle to the strong. But there are limits set to that struggle by man in the substitution, also within limits, of social progress for cosmic progress. In this Ethical Evolution selfishness is so far checked as to permit groups of human beings to live together in amity, recognising certain common rights, which restrain the self-regarding impulses. For, in the words of Marcus Aurelius, ""that which is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee"" (Med., vi, 54). Huxley aptly likens this counter-process to the action of a gardener in dealing with a piece of waste ground. He stamps out the weeds, and plants fragrant flowers and useful fruits. But he must not relax his efforts, otherwise the weeds will return, and the untended plants will be choked and perish. So in conduct. For the common weal, in which the unit shares, thus blending the selfish and the unselfish motives, men check their natural impulses. The emotions and affections which they share with the lower social animals, only in higher degree, are co-operative, and largely help the development of family, tribal, and national life. But once we let these be weakened, and society becomes a bear-garden. Force being the dominant factor in life, the struggle for existence revives in all its primitive violence, and atavism asserts its power. Therefore, although he do the best that in him lies, man can only set limits to that struggle, for the ethical process is an integral part of the cosmic powers, ""just as the 'governor' in a steam-engine is part of the mechanism of the engine."" As with society, so with its units: there is no truce in the contest. Dr. Plimmer, an eminent bacteriologist, describes to the writer the action of a kind of yeast upon a species of Daphnia, or water-flea. Metschnikoff observed that these yeast-cells, which enter with the animal's food, penetrate the intestines, and get into the tissues. They are there seized upon by the leukocytes, which gather round the invaders in larger fashion, as if seemingly endowed with consciousness, so marvellous is the strategy. If they win, the Daphnia recovers; if they lose, it dies. ""In a similar manner in ourselves certain leukocytes (phagocytes) accumulate at any point of invasion, and pick up the living bacteria,"" and in the success or failure of their attack lies the fate of man. Which things are fact as well as allegory; and time is on the side of the bacteria. For as our life is but a temporary arrest of the universal movement toward dissolution, so naught in our actions can arrest the destiny of our kind. Huxley thus puts it in the concluding sentences of his Preface--written in July, 1894, one year before his death--to the reissue of Evolution and Ethics: ""That man, as a 'political animal,' is susceptible of a vast amount of improvement, by education, by instruction, and by the application of his intelligence to the adaptation of the conditions of life to his higher needs, I entertain not the slightest doubt. But, so long as he remains liable to error, intellectual or moral; so long as he is compelled to be perpetually on guard against the cosmic forces, whose ends are not his ends, without and within himself; so long as he is haunted by inexpugnable memories and hopeless aspirations; so long as the recognition of his intellectual limitations forces him to acknowledge his incapacity to penetrate the mystery of existence; the prospect of attaining untroubled happiness, or of a state which can, even remotely, deserve the title of perfection, appears to me to be as misleading an illusion as ever was dangled before the eyes of poor humanity. And there have been many of them. That which lies before the human race is a constant struggle to maintain and improve, in opposition to the State of Nature, the State of Art of an organised polity; in which, and by which, man may develop a worthy civilisation, capable of maintaining and constantly improving itself, until the evolution of our globe shall have entered so far upon its downward course that the cosmic process resumes its sway; and, once more, the State of Nature prevails over the surface of our planet."" But only those of low ideals would seek in this impermanence of things excuse for inaction; or worse, for self-indulgence. The world will last a very long time yet, and afford scope for battle against the wrongs done by man to man. Even were it and ourselves to perish to-morrow, our duty is clear while the chance of doing it may be ours. Clifford,--dead before his prime, before the rich promise of his genius had its full fruitage,--speaking of the inevitable end of the earth ""and all the consciousness of men"" reminds us, in his essay on The First and Last Catastrophe, that we are helped in facing the fact ""by the words of Spinoza: 'The free man thinks of nothing so little as of death, and his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of life.'"" ""Our interest,"" Clifford adds, ""lies with so much of the past as may serve to guide our actions in the present, and to intensify our pious allegiance to the fathers who have gone before us and the brethren who are with us; and our interest lies with so much of the future as we may hope will be appreciably affected by our good actions now. Do I seem to say, 'Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die?' Far from it; on the contrary I say, 'Let us take hands and help, for this day we are alive together.'"" Evolution and Ethics was Huxley's last important deliverance, since the completion of his reply to Mr. Balfour's ""quaintly entitled"" Foundations of Belief was arrested by his death on the 30th of June, 1895. In looking through the Collected Essays, which represent his non-technical contributions to knowledge, there may be regret that throughout his life circumstances were against his doing any piece of long-sustained work, such as that which, for example, the affluence and patience of Darwin permitted him to do. But until Huxley's later years, and, indeed, through broken health to the end, his work outside official demands had to be done fitfully and piecemeal, or not at all. Notwithstanding this, it has the unity which is inspired by a central idea. The application of the theory of evolution all round imparts a quality of relation to subjects seemingly diverse. And this comes out clearly and strongly in the more orderly arrangement of the material in the new issue of Collected Essays. These show what an omnivorous reader he was; how well equipped in classics, theology, and general literature, in addition to subjects distinctly his own. He sympathized with every branch of culture. As contrasted with physical science, he said, ""Nothing would grieve me more than to see literary training other than a very prominent branch of education."" One corner of his library was filled with a strange company of antiquated books","It has penetrated the mists of antiquity, and traced the myth of a forfeited Paradise, of the Creation, the Deluge, and other legends, to their birthplaces in the valley of the Euphrates or the uplands of Persia; legends whose earliest inscribed records are on Accadian tablets, or in the scriptures of Zarathustra. It has in the spirit of the commended Bereans, ""searched"" those and other scriptures, finding therein legends of founders of ancient faiths cognate to those which in the course of the centuries gathered round Jesus of Nazareth; it has collated the rites and ceremonies of many a barbaric theology with those of old-world religions--Brahmanic, Buddhistic, Christian--and found only such differences between them as are referable to the higher or the lower culture.

And it is with the incarnated ideas, uninfluenced by the particular creed in connection with which it finds them, that anthropology deals. Its method is that of biology. Without bias, without assumptions of relative truth or falsity, the anthropologist searches into origins, traces variations, compares and classifies, and relates the several families to one ordinal group.

Unfortunately, this method, whose application to the physical sciences is unchallenged, is, when applied to beliefs, regarded as one of attack, instead of being one of explanation.

Clifford,--dead before his prime, before the rich promise of his genius had its full fruitage,--speaking of the inevitable end of the earth ""and all the consciousness of men"" reminds us, in his essay on The First and Last Catastrophe, that we are helped in facing the fact ""by the words of Spinoza: 'The free man thinks of nothing so little as of death, and his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of life.'"" ""Our interest,"" Clifford adds, ""lies with so much of the past as may serve to guide our actions in the present, and to intensify our pious allegiance to the fathers who have gone before us and the brethren who are with us; and our interest lies with so much of the future as we may hope will be appreciably affected by our good actions now. Do I seem to say, 'Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die?' Far from it; on the contrary I say, 'Let us take hands and help, for this day we are alive together.'"" Evolution and Ethics was Huxley's last important deliverance, since the completion of his reply to Mr. Balfour's ""quaintly entitled"" Foundations of Belief was arrested by his death on the 30th of June, 1895. In looking through the Collected Essays, which represent his non-technical contributions to knowledge, there may be regret that throughout his life circumstances were against his doing any piece of long-sustained work, such as that which, for example, the affluence and patience of Darwin permitted him to do. But until Huxley's later years, and, indeed, through broken health to the end, his work outside official demands had to be done fitfully and piecemeal, or not at all. Notwithstanding this, it has the unity which is inspired by a central idea. The application of the theory of evolution all round imparts a quality of relation to subjects seemingly diverse. And this comes out clearly and strongly in the more orderly arrangement of the material in the new issue of Collected Essays. These show what an omnivorous reader he was; how well equipped in classics, theology, and general literature, in addition to subjects distinctly his own. He sympathized with every branch of culture. As contrasted with physical science, he said, ""Nothing would grieve me more than to see literary training other than a very prominent branch of education."""
Clodd__Edward,39526_PioneersofEvolution.txt,1," evidence of the latest utterances of a science whose main concern is with the origin, nature, and destiny of man. The extension of the comparative method to the various products of man's intellectual and spiritual nature is the logical sequence to the adoption of that method throughout every department of the universe. Of course it starts with the assumption of differences in things, else it would be superfluous. But it equally starts with the assumption of resemblances, and in every case it has brought out the fact that the differences are superficial, and that the resemblances are fundamental. All this bears closely on Huxley's work. The impulse thereto has come largely from the evidence focussed in Man's Place in Nature, evidence of which the material of the writings of his later years is the expansion. The cultivation of intellect and character had always been a favourite theme with him, and the interest was widened when the passing of Mr. Forster's Elementary Education Act in 1870 brought the problem of popular culture to the front. The wave of enthusiasm carried a group of distinguished liberal candidates to the polls, and Huxley was elected a member of the School Board for London. Then, although in not so acute a form as now, the religious difficulty was the sole cause of any serious division, and Huxley's attitude therein puzzled a good many people because he advocated the retention of the Bible in the schools. Those who should have known him better thought that he was (to quote from one of his letters to the writer) ""a hypocrite, or simply a fool."" ""But,"" he adds, ""my meaning was that the mass of the people should not be deprived of the one great literature which is open to them, nor shut out from the perception of its place in the whole past history of civilised mankind."" He lamented, as every thoughtful person must lament, the decay of Bible reading in this generation, while, at the same time, he advocated the more strenuously its detachment from the glosses and theological inferences which do irreparable injury to a literature whose value cannot be overrated. For Huxley was well read in history, and therefore he would not trust the clergy as interpreters of the Bible. After repeating in the Prologue to his Essays on Controverted Questions what he had said about the book in his article on the School Boards in Critiques and Addresses, he adds, ""I laid stress on the necessity of placing such instruction in lay hands; in the hope and belief that it would thus gradually accommodate itself to the coming changes of opinion; that the theology and the legend would drop more and more out of sight, while the perennially interesting historical, literary, and ethical contents would come more and more into view."" Subsequent events have justified neither the hope nor the belief. Had Huxley lived to see that all the sectaries, while quarrelling as to the particular dogmas which may be deduced from the Bible, agree in refusing to use it other than as an instrument for the teaching of dogma, he would probably have come to see that the only solution in the interests of the young, is its exclusion from the schools. Never has any collection of writings, whose miscellaneous, unequal, and often disconnected character is obscured by the common title ""Bible"" which covers them, had such need for deliverance from the so-called ""believers"" in it. Its value is only to be realized in the degree that theories of its inspiration are abandoned. Then only is it possible to treat it like any other literature of the kind; to discriminate between the coarse and barbaric features which evidence the humanness of its origin, and the loftier features of its later portions which also evidence how it falls into line with other witnesses of man's gradual ethical and spiritual development. Huxley's breadth of view, his sympathy with every branch of culture, his advocacy of literary in unison with scientific training, fitted him supremely for the work of the School Board, but its demands were too severe on a man never physically strong, and he was forced to resign. However, he was thereby set free for other work, which could be only effectively done by exchanging the arena for the study. The earliest important outcome of that relief was the monograph on Hume, published in 1879, and the latest was the Romanes lecture on Evolution and Ethics, which was delivered in the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford on the 18th of May, 1893. Between the two lie a valuable series of papers dealing with the Evolution of Theology and cognate subjects. In all these we have the application of the theory of Evolution to the explanation of the origin of beliefs and of the basis of morals. To quote the saying attributed to Leibnitz, both Spencer and Huxley, and all who follow them, care for ""science only because it enables them to speak with authority in philosophy and religion."" In a letter to the writer, wherein Huxley refers to his retirement from official life, he says:-- I was so ill that I thought with Hamlet, ""the rest is silence."" But my wiry constitution has unexpectedly weathered the storm, and I have every reason to believe that with renunciation of the devil and all his works (i. e., public speaking, dining, and being dined, etc.) my faculties may be unimpaired for a good spell yet. And whether my lease is long or short, I mean to devote them to the work I began in the paper on the Evolution of Theology. That essay was first published in two sections in the Nineteenth Century, 1886, and was the sequel to the eighth chapter of his Hume. The Romanes Lecture supplemented the last chapter of that book. All these are accessible enough to render superfluous any abstract of their contents. But the tribute due to David Hume, who may well-nigh claim place among the few but fit company of Pioneers, warrants reference to his anticipation of accepted theories of the origin of belief in spiritual beings in his Natural History of Religion, published in 1757. He says: ""There is an universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like themselves, and to transfer to every object those qualities with which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately conscious.... The unknown causes which continually employ their thought, appearing always in the same aspect, are all apprehended to be of the same kind or species. Nor is it long before we ascribe to them thought, and reason, and passion, and sometimes even the limbs and figures of men, in order to bring them nearer to a resemblance with ourselves."" In his address to the Sorbonne on The Successive Advances of the Human Mind, delivered in 1750, Turgot expresses the same idea, touching, as John Morley says in his essay on that statesman, ""the root of most of the wrong thinking that has been as a manacle to science."" The foregoing, and passages of a like order, are made by Huxley the text of his elaborations of the several stages of theological evolution, the one note of all of which is the continuity of belief in supernatural intervention. But more important than the decay of that belief which is the prelude to decay of belief in deity itself as commonly defined, is the resulting transfer of the foundation of morals, in other words, of motives to conduct, from a theological to a social base. Theology is not morality; indeed, it is, too often, immorality. It is concerned with man's relations to the gods in whom he believes; while morals are concerned with man's relations to his fellows. The one looks heavenward, wondering what dues shall be paid the gods to win their smiles or ward off their frowns. In old Rome sanctitas or holiness, was, according to Cicero, ""the knowledge of the rites which had to be performed."" These done, the gods were expected to do their part. So in new Rome, when the Catholic has attended mass, his share in the contract is ended. Worship and sacrifice, as mere acts toward supernatural beings, may be consonant with any number of lapses in conduct. Morality, on the other hand, looks earthward, and is prompted to action solely by what is due from a man to his fellow-men, or from his fellow-men to him. Its foundation therefore is not in supernatural beliefs, but in social instincts. All sin is thus resolved into an anti-social act: a wrong done by man to man. This is not merely readjustment; it is revolution. For it is the rejection of theology with its appeals to human obligation to deity, and to man's hopes of future reward or fears of future punishment; and it is the acceptance of wholly secular motives as incentives to right action. Those motives, having their foundation in the physical, mental, and moral results of our deeds, rest on a stable basis. No longer interlaced with the unstable theological, they neither abide nor perish with it. And one redeeming feature of our time is that the churches are beginning to see this, and to be effected by it. John Morley caustically remarks that ""the efforts of the heterodox have taught them to be better Christians than they were a hundred years ago."" Certain extremists excepted, they are keeping dogma in the background, and are laying stress on the socialism which it is contended was at the heart of the teaching of Jesus. Wisely, if not very consistently, they are seeking alliance with the liberal movements whose aim is the ""abolition of privilege."" The liberal theologians, in the face of the varying ethical standards which mark the Old Testament and the New, no longer insist on the absoluteness of moral codes, and so fall into line with the evolutionist in his theory of their relativeness. For society in its advance from lower to higher conceptions of duty, completely reverses its ethics, looking back with horror on that which was once permitted and unquestioned. It is with this checking of ""the ape and tiger,"" and this fostering of the ""angel"" in man, that Huxley dealt in his Romanes Lecture. There was much unintelligent, and some wilful, misunderstanding of his argument, else a prominent Catholic biologist would hardly have welcomed it as a possible prelude to Huxley's submission to the Church. Yet the reasoning was clear enough, and in no wise contravened the application of Evolution to morals. Huxley showed that Evolution is both cosmical and ethical. Cosmic Evolution has resulted in the universe with its non-living and living contents, and since, dealing with the conditions which obtain on our planet, there is not sufficient elbow-room or food for all the offspring of living things, the result is a furious struggle in which the strong win and transmit their advantages to their descendants. Nature is wholly selfish; the race is to the swift, and the battle to the strong. But there are limits set to that struggle by man in the substitution, also within limits, of social progress for cosmic progress. In this Ethical Evolution selfishness is so far checked as to permit groups of human beings to live together in amity, recognising certain common rights, which restrain the self-regarding impulses. For, in the words of Marcus Aurelius, ""that which is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee"" (Med., vi, 54). Huxley aptly likens this counter-process to the action of a gardener in dealing with a piece of waste ground. He stamps out the weeds, and plants fragrant flowers and useful fruits. But he must not relax his efforts, otherwise the weeds will return, and the untended plants will be choked and perish. So in conduct. For the common weal, in which the unit shares, thus blending the selfish and the unselfish motives, men check their natural impulses. The emotions and affections which they share with the lower social animals, only in higher degree, are co-operative, and largely help the development of family, tribal, and national life. But once we let these be weakened, and society becomes a bear-garden. Force being the dominant factor in life, the struggle for existence revives in all its primitive violence, and atavism asserts its power. Therefore, although he do the best that in him lies, man can only set limits to that struggle, for the ethical process is an integral part of the cosmic powers, ""just as the 'governor' in a steam-engine is part of the mechanism of the engine."" As with society, so with its units: there is no truce in the contest. Dr. Plimmer, an eminent bacteriologist, describes to the writer the action of a kind of yeast upon a species of Daphnia, or water-flea. Metschnikoff observed that these yeast-cells, which enter with the animal's food, penetrate the intestines, and get into the tissues. They are there seized upon by the leukocytes, which gather round the invaders in larger fashion, as if seemingly endowed with consciousness, so marvellous is the strategy. If they win, the Daphnia recovers; if they lose, it dies. ""In a similar manner in ourselves certain leukocytes (phagocytes) accumulate at any point of invasion, and pick up the living bacteria,"" and in the success or failure of their attack lies the fate of man. Which things are fact as well as allegory; and time is on the side of the bacteria. For as our life is but a temporary arrest of the universal movement toward dissolution, so naught in our actions can arrest the destiny of our kind. Huxley thus puts it in the concluding sentences of his Preface--written in July, 1894, one year before his death--to the reissue of Evolution and Ethics: ""That man, as a 'political animal,' is susceptible of a vast amount of improvement, by education, by instruction, and by the application of his intelligence to the adaptation of the conditions of life to his higher needs, I entertain not the slightest doubt. But, so long as he remains liable to error, intellectual or moral; so long as he is compelled to be perpetually on guard against the cosmic forces, whose ends are not his ends, without and within himself; so long as he is haunted by inexpugnable memories and hopeless aspirations; so long as the recognition of his intellectual limitations forces him to acknowledge his incapacity to penetrate the mystery of existence; the prospect of attaining untroubled happiness, or of a state which can, even remotely, deserve the title of perfection, appears to me to be as misleading an illusion as ever was dangled before the eyes of poor humanity. And there have been many of them. That which lies before the human race is a constant struggle to maintain and improve, in opposition to the State of Nature, the State of Art of an organised polity; in which, and by which, man may develop a worthy civilisation, capable of maintaining and constantly improving itself, until the evolution of our globe shall have entered so far upon its downward course that the cosmic process resumes its sway; and, once more, the State of Nature prevails over the surface of our planet."" But only those of low ideals would seek in this impermanence of things excuse for inaction; or worse, for self-indulgence. The world will last a very long time yet, and afford scope for battle against the wrongs done by man to man. Even were it and ourselves to perish to-morrow, our duty is clear while the chance of doing it may be ours. Clifford,--dead before his prime, before the rich promise of his genius had its full fruitage,--speaking of the inevitable end of the earth ""and all the consciousness of men"" reminds us, in his essay on The First and Last Catastrophe, that we are helped in facing the fact ""by the words of Spinoza: 'The free man thinks of nothing so little as of death, and his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of life.'""

Do I seem to say, 'Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die?' Far from it; on the contrary I say, 'Let us take hands and help, for this day we are alive together.'"" Evolution and Ethics was Huxley's last important deliverance, since the completion of his reply to Mr. Balfour's ""quaintly entitled"" Foundations of Belief was arrested by his death on the 30th of June, 1895. In looking through the Collected Essays, which represent his non-technical contributions to knowledge, there may be regret that throughout his life circumstances were against his doing any piece of long-sustained work, such as that which, for example, the affluence and patience of Darwin permitted him to do. But until Huxley's later years, and, indeed, through broken health to the end, his work outside official demands had to be done fitfully and piecemeal, or not at all.

And this comes out clearly and strongly in the more orderly arrangement of the material in the new issue of Collected Essays.

As contrasted with physical science, he said, ""Nothing would grieve me more than to see literary training other than a very prominent branch of education."" One corner of his library was filled with a strange company of antiquated books of orthodox type; this he called ""the condemned cell."" When looking at the ""strange bedfellows"" that slept on the shelves, the writer asked Huxley what author had most influenced a style whose clearness and vigour, nevertheless, seems unborrowed; and he at once named the masculine and pellucid Leviathan of Hobbes. He had the happy faculty of rapidly assimilating what he read; of clearly grasping an opponent's standpoint; and what is a man's salvation nowadays, freedom from that curse of specialism which kills all sense of proportion, and reduces its slave to the level of the machine-hand that spends his life in making the heads of screws. He believed in ""scepticism as the highest duty, and in blind faith as the one unpardonable sin."" ""And,"" he adds, ""it cannot be otherwise, for every great advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute rejection of authority, the cherishing of the keenest scepticism, the annihilation of the spirit of blind faith; and the most ardent votary of science holds his firmest convictions, not because the men he most venerates holds them; not because their verity is testified by portents and wonders; but because his experience teaches him that whenever he chooses to bring these convictions into contact with their primary source, Nature--whenever he thinks fit to test them by appealing to experiment and to observation--Nature will confirm them. The man of science has learned to believe in justification, not by faith, but by verification."" Therefore he nursed no illusions; would not say that he knew when he did not or could not know, and bidding us follow the evidence whithersoever it leads us, remains the surest-footed guide of our time. Such leadership is his, since he has gone on ""from strength to strength."" The changes in the attitude of man toward momentous questions which new evidence and the zeit-geist have effected, have been approaches to the position taken by Huxley since he first caught the public ear. His deep religious feeling kept him in sympathetic touch with his fellows. Ever present to him was ""that consciousness of the limitation of man, that sense of an open secret which he cannot penetrate, in which lies the essence of all religion."" In one of his replies to a prominent exponent of the Comtian philosophy, that ""incongruous mixture of bad science with eviscerated papistry,"" as he calls it, Huxley protests against the idea that the teaching o","The extension of the comparative method to the various products of man's intellectual and spiritual nature is the logical sequence to the adoption of that method throughout every department of the universe. Of course it starts with the assumption of differences in things, else it would be superfluous.

Clifford,--dead before his prime, before the rich promise of his genius had its full fruitage,--speaking of the inevitable end of the earth ""and all the consciousness of men"" reminds us, in his essay on The First and Last Catastrophe, that we are helped in facing the fact ""by the words of Spinoza: 'The free man thinks of nothing so little as of death, and his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of life.'"" ""Our interest,"" Clifford adds, ""lies with so much of the past as may serve to guide our actions in the present, and to intensify our pious allegiance to the fathers who have gone before us and the brethren who are with us; and our interest lies with so much of the future as we may hope will be appreciably affected by our good actions now. Do I seem to say, 'Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die?' Far from it; on the contrary I say, 'Let us take hands and help, for this day we are alive together.'"" Evolution and Ethics was Huxley's last important deliverance, since the completion of his reply to Mr. Balfour's ""quaintly entitled"" Foundations of Belief was arrested by his death on the 30th of June, 1895. In looking through the Collected Essays, which represent his non-technical contributions to knowledge, there may be regret that throughout his life circumstances were against his doing any piece of long-sustained work, such as that which, for example, the affluence and patience of Darwin permitted him to do. But until Huxley's later years, and, indeed, through broken health to the end, his work outside official demands had to be done fitfully and piecemeal, or not at all. Notwithstanding this, it has the unity which is inspired by a central idea. The application of the theory of evolution all round imparts a quality of relation to subjects seemingly diverse. And this comes out clearly and strongly in the more orderly arrangement of the material in the new issue of Collected Essays. These show what an omnivorous reader he was; how well equipped in classics, theology, and general literature, in addition to subjects distinctly his own. He sympathized with every branch of culture. As contrasted with physical science, he said, ""Nothing would grieve me more than to see literary training other than a very prominent branch of education."" One corner of his library was filled with a strange company of antiquated books of orthodox type; this he called ""the condemned cell."" When looking at the ""strange bedfellows"" that slept on the shelves, the writer asked Huxley what author had most influenced a style whose clearness and vigour, nevertheless, seems unborrowed; and he at once named the masculine and pellucid Leviathan of Hobbes. He had the happy faculty of rapidly assimilating what he read; of clearly grasping an opponent's standpoint; and what is a man's salvation nowadays, freedom from that curse of specialism which kills all sense of proportion, and reduces its slave to the level of the machine-hand that spends his life in making the heads of screws. He believed in ""scepticism as the highest duty, and in blind faith as the one unpardonable sin."" ""And,"" he adds, ""it cannot be otherwise, for every great advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute rejection of authority, the cherishing of the keenest scepticism, the annihilation of the spirit of blind faith; and the most ardent votary of science holds his firmest convictions, not because the men he most venerates holds them; not because their verity is testified by portents and wonders; but because his experience teaches him that whenever he chooses to bring these convictions into contact with their primary source, Nature--whenever he thinks fit to test them by appealing to experiment and to observation--Nature will confirm them. The man of science has learned to believe in justification, not by faith, but by verification."" Therefore he nursed no illusions; would not say that he knew when he did not or could not know, and bidding us follow the evidence whithersoever it leads us, remains the surest-footed guide of our time. Such leadership is his, since he has gone on ""from strength to strength."" The changes in the attitude of man toward momentous questions which new evidence and the zeit-geist have effected, have been approaches to the position taken by Huxley since he first caught the public ear. His deep religious feeling kept him in sympathetic touch with his fellows. Ever present to him was ""that consciousness of the limitation of man, that sense of an open secret which he cannot penetrate, in which lies the essence of all religion."""
Seward__A__C___Albert_Charles_,62521_LinksWiththe.txt,0,"le of Wight, in the Weald district of Kent and neighbouring counties, point to the existence of a lake over a portion of the south of England and of the English Channel. The remains of a rich Wealden flora have been collected from these Wealden sediments, notably from the plant-beds of Ecclesbourne near Hastings, in which, so far as we know, flowering plants played no part or at most occupied a very subordinate position. A few fossil leaves have been described from rocks assigned to a Wealden age,--and from the older Stonesfield Slate, of Jurassic age, a single leaf is recorded,--which seem to be those of Dicotyledons; but it is certain that even in the early days of the Cretaceous period the present dominant group in the plant kingdom was in its infancy and in many regions probably unrepresented. When we glance at the geological table and consider that in all the floras from the Wealden down to the Devonian period, flowering plants played no part, we are able to appreciate the fact of their rapid development, referred to in a previous chapter, when once this highest type had become established. The rocks comprised in the Jurassic system extend from East Yorkshire to the coast of Dorsetshire; they consist of a succession of limestones, clays, sandstones, and a few thin beds of impure coal. Sediments of this age also occur, though to a much less extent, on the north-east coast of Scotland and in a few places in the Inner Hebrides. Many of the Jurassic strata contain only marine shells, and corals are occasionally abundant, though in the lower members of the system in the cliffs near Lyme Regis and at Whitby fossil plants are fairly common. It is, however, from the middle Jurassic beds, in the cliffs between Whitby and Scarborough, and in some inland quarries in East Yorkshire, that we have obtained the richest Jurassic flora. Rivers from a northern land laden with sediment and carrying drift-wood, leaves and other plant fragments, deposited their burden in an estuary which occupied the eastern edge of Yorkshire. Sedimentary rocks laid down towards the close of the Jurassic period in the island of Portland in the south and on the Sutherland coast in the north have furnished valuable records of plant-life. The passage from the Jurassic to the underlying Triassic system is formed by some shales and limestones in South Wales containing remains of fish and other marine organisms. These so-called Rhaetic beds are poorly represented in the British area, but on the continent of Europe and in other regions the sediments of this age bulk much more largely and have yielded a rich collection of plants. The rocks of the upper division of the Triassic system, as seen in the Midlands, point to the prevalence of desert conditions; and in the grooved sand-polished surfaces of granite in Charnwood forest we have a glimpse of a Triassic landscape. The salt-bearing strata of this period in Cheshire and Worcestershire suggest conditions paralleled at the present day in the Caspian and Dead-Sea regions. The vegetation of Britain, and indeed of the world as a whole, seems to have undergone but little change during the enormous lapse of time represented by the sediments comprised between the Wealden and Triassic periods. The Lower Triassic flora affords evidence of a change in the facies of the vegetation and prepares us for the still greater differences revealed by a study of the Permian and Carboniferous floras. To the student of evolution these Palaeozoic floras are of special interest on account of the facts they have contributed in regard to the descent and inter-relationship of different branches of the vegetable kingdom. It is by a patient study of the waifs and strays of the vegetation of successive phases of the world's history preserved in sedimentary strata, that it has been possible to follow the history of many existing plants and to establish links between the present and the past. CHAPTER IV PRESERVATION OF PLANTS AS FOSSILS 'Some whim of Nature locked them fast in stone for us afterthoughts of Creation.' Lowell. The failure of the earlier naturalists to grasp the true significance of fossils or even to appreciate their nature is an extraordinary fact when we consider the pioneer work which they accomplished in biological and geological science. The following extract from the writings of so enlightened a man as John Ray serves to illustrate an almost incredible disinclination to admit what seems to us the obvious. He wrote:--'Yet I must not dissemble that there is a Phenomenon in Nature, which doth somewhat puzzle us to reconcile with the prudence observable in all its work, and seems strongly to prove, that Nature doth sometimes ludere, and delineates figures, for no other end, but for the ornament of some stone, and to entertain or gratify our curiosity, and exercise our wits. This is, those elegant impressions of leaves and plants upon cole-slate, the knowledge of which, I must confess myself to leave to my learned and ingenious friend Mr Edward Lhwyd of Oxford.... He told me that Mr Woodward, a Londoner, shewed him very good draughts of the common female fern, naturally formed in cole.... But these figures are more diligently to be observed and considered... Dr Woodward will have them to be the impressions of the leaves of plants which were there lodged at the time of the Deluge'(31). The Mr Woodward alluded to by Ray thus expressed his views on fossils in an Essay towards the Natural History of the Earth:--'The whole terrestrial globe was taken all to pieces and dissolved at the Deluge, the particles of stone, marble, and all solid fossils dissevered, taken up into the water, and then sustained together with sea shells and other animal and vegetable bodies; the present earth consists and was formed out of that promiscuous mass of sand, earth, shells, and the rest falling down again, and subsiding from the water'(32). In the later part of the seventeenth-century Steno, a Dane by birth and Professor of Anatomy at Padua, by his recognition of the identity of the teeth in a shark's head, which he had dissected, with some fossils from Malta known as Glossopetrae, established the true nature of fossils. He also recognised a certain orderly sequence in fossiliferous strata, and in the opinion of Professor Sollas he is entitled to be considered the 'Father and Founder' of Geology(33). It was by slow degrees that the early observers freed themselves from the obsession that the remains of animals and plants in the earth's crust bear witness to a Universal Deluge and are all identical with existing species. The possibility that some of the fossil plants in English strata might be more clearly related to forms now met with in warmer regions was gradually realised. The publication of the Origin of Species stimulated palaeontological research, and botanists as well as zoologists turned to the investigation of extinct genera in search of proofs of the doctrine of evolution. The common occurrence of petrified wood in rocks of different ages is well known. Fossil stems are occasionally found in their natural position of growth, the structural details being rendered permanent by the deposition of siliceous or calcareous material from water drawn by capillarity into the dead but still sound tissues. Petrified wood from Upper Jurassic beds is abundant in the Island of Purbeck; an unusually long piece of stem may be seen in the small town of Portland fixed to the wall of a house. Some of these stems have been referred by an American author to the Araucarian family of Conifers, but the structure is as a rule hardly well enough preserved to afford satisfactory evidence for identification. In his Testimony of the Rocks, Hugh Miller speaks of fossil wood from the upper beds of the Jurassic system in sufficient abundance on the beach at Helmsdale in Sutherlandshire to be collected in cart-loads; it is still easy to pick up good specimens on the shingle beach a short distance north of Helmsdale, and a recent microscopical examination showed that some specimens are pieces of an Araucarian tree. Impressive examples of petrified trees on a large scale are to be seen in the United States, in Arizona and the Yellowstone Park. (Frontispiece.) In the northern part of Arizona the country for over an area of 10 square miles is covered with tree trunks, some reaching 200 feet in length and a diameter of 10 feet. The nature of the mineralising substance has given rise to the name Chalcedony Park for this Triassic forest(34). A striking example of one of the Arizona trees is exhibited in the British Museum and in a neighbouring case is a splendid petrified stem, 9 ft. in height, of a conifer discovered in Tertiary lavas in Tasmania(35). [Illustration: Fig. 6. Section of the north face of Amethyst Mountain, Yellowstone Park, including upwards of 2000 ft. of strata. The steepness of the slope is exaggerated. (After W. H. Holmes.)] Figure 6 illustrates the preservation of a series of forests of Tertiary age in the mass of volcanic sediments, 2000 feet in thickness, known as Amethyst mountain, in the Yellowstone Park district. By the weathering away of the surrounding volcanic material the tall stems of the trees are exposed in places on the mountain sides like the 'columns of a ruined temple.' The height of the river at the foot of the cliff is 6700 ft. above sea-level and the mountain rises to a height of 9400 ft. above the sea. In the lower part of the section the volcanic strata are seen to rest on a foundation of older rocks A, and these in turn were laid down on the eroded surface of a still more ancient foundation, B(36). The section as a whole affords a striking demonstration of the magnitude of earth-movements since the last of these forests was buried below the surface of a sea in which the volcanic material was deposited. The account of the Yellowstone Park section recalls Darwin's description in the Naturalist's Voyage(37) of snow-white columns projecting from a bare slope, at an altitude of 7000 ft. in the Cordillera. The abundance of drift-wood on the coasts of some countries at the present day helps us to picture the conditions under which the remains of former forests have been preserved. In his Letters from High Latitudes, Lord Dufferin gives the following description of drift-wood on the shores of Spitzbergen:--'A little to the northward, I observed, lying on the sea-shore innumerable logs of drift-wood. This wood is floated all the way from America by the Gulf Stream, and as I walked from one huge bole to another, I could not help wondering in what primeval forest each had grown, what chance had originally cast them on the waters, and piloted them to this desert shore'(38). A photograph reproduced in Amundsen's book on The North West Passage shows the beach on the Alaskan coast strewn with drifted timber(39). For the accompanying photograph (Fig. 7) of the flood-plain of the Colorado River(40), I am indebted to Professor MacDougal of the Desert Research Laboratory at Tucson, Arizona, who in a recent letter writes, 'During times of high-water a thin sheet of flood covers the flat for many miles and bears drift-wood so thickly that it is difficult to push a boat through it.' The drift-wood consists of poplar, willow, pine, and juniper, 'the last two have been brought from the upper river, from as far away as a thousand miles.' A picture such as this affords an admirable example of the wealth of material available for preservation in a fossil state. It is only in the minority of cases that the accidents of preservation of fragments of ancient floras have given us the means of investigating the internal structure of the plant organs. It is far more frequently the case that fossil plants are represented only by a carbonised film on the surface of a piece of shale or other rock: the actual substance of the plant has been converted into a thin layer of coal, and though the venation and other surface-features may be clearly revealed, the internal tissues have been destroyed. If a lump of clay containing a piece of fern frond is heated, the result is an impression of the leaf on the hardened matrix and a coaly substance in place of the plant substance. It is occasionally possible by detaching a piece of the black film from a fossil, and heating it with nitric acid and chlorate of potash and then dipping it in ammonia, to obtain a transparent preparation suitable for microscopical examination of the cell-outlines of the superficial layer of the leaf or other plant-fragment. This method of examination, used by several students of fossil plants and with conspicuous success by Professor Nathorst of Stockholm, often affords valuable aids to identification. [Illustration: Fig. 7. Flood-plain of the delta of Rio Colorado. The hills in the background are 25 miles distant. (From a photograph by Prof. MacDougal.)] Pieces of plants embedded in sandy sediment, if not preserved by petrifaction, that is by the introduction into the tissues of some siliceous or calcareous solution, gradually decay and their fragmentary remains may be washed away by percolating water, leaving a hollow mould in the gradually hardening sediment, which is afterwards filled with sand or other material. The plant itself is destroyed, but a cast is taken which in the case of fine-grained sediments reproduces the form and surface-pattern of the original specimen. The incrustation of plants by the falsely named petrifying springs of Knaresborough and other places illustrate another method of fossilisation. [Illustration: Fig. 8. Flower of Cinnamomum prototypum Conw. preserved in amber.  10. (After Conwentz.)] Plants which owe their preservation to amber occur both as incrustations and petrifactions. This fossil resin occurs in Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Jurassic rocks; the amber found in abundance on the Baltic coast near Danzig and occasionally picked up on the beach in Norfolk and Suffolk comes from beds of Tertiary age. Pieces of Pine-wood have been described from the Baltic beds in which the tissues are perfectly preserved as the result of the conversion into amber of the resinous secretion which permeates their cells: in this case the amber is a petrifying agent. More frequently the preservation is due to incrustation; as resin trickled down the stems of the Tertiary pines from an open wound, flowers and leaves, blown by the wind on to the sticky surface, were eventually sealed up in a translucent case of amber. Though the actual substance may have gone, the mould which remains exhibits in wonderful perfection each separate organ of a flower or the delicate hair-clusters on the surface of a leaf. The flower represented in Fig. 8, a species of Cinnamon, is one of several specimens described by the authors of a monograph of Tertiary plants in the Baltic amber(41). The fragments of plants preserved in nodules of calcareous rock occasionally met with in some of the Lancashire and Yorkshire coal-seams are perhaps the most striking examples of the possibilities of petrifaction. By cutting sections of these nodules and grinding them to a transparent thinness, the most delicate tissues of Carboniferous plants are rendered accessible to investigation under the high power of a microscope. As our attention is absorbed by the examination of the details of cell-structure it is easy to forget that the section has not been cut from a living plant, but from the twig of a tree which grew in the forests of the Coal age. The preservation is such as to enable us not only to describe the anatomy of these extinct types of vegetation, but, by the application of the knowledge of the relation between the structure of the plant-machine and its functions gained by a study of living species, it is possible in some degree to picture the plants of the Coal period as living organisms and to see in the structural framework a reflection of external environment. The recognition in the general architectural plan of the Palaeozoic plants, as in many of the finer anatomical features, of the closest resemblance to plants of the modern world produces an almost overwhelming sense of continuity between the past and the present. The plants of the Palaeozoic period, though often differing considerably from those of the same class in the floras of to-day, exhibit a remarkably high type of organisation. Some of the most abundant trees in the forest of the Coal age are decidedly superior in the complexity of their structure, as also in size, to modern survivals of the same stock. On the other hand, it must be remembered that Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons which now occupy the highest place in the hierarchy of plants have left no sign of their existence in any of the Palaeozoic strata. The greater size of some of the Palaeozoic plants, and in some respects the more advanced stage of evolution which they represent as compared with their nearest relatives of the present era, must be considered in relation to their more important and relatively higher position in the plant-world than that which is now held by their diminutive descendants. It is, however, impossible to get away from the conclusion that the oldest Palaeozoic flora of which we have an intimate knowledge must be the product of development of an age which is represented by a chapter in the history of the plant kingdom at least as far removed from the beginning as it is separated from the chapter now being written. Examples might be quoted in illustration of the risks attending the determination of fossils by means of external features alone, but it may suffice to mention the case of a specimen originally described as a fragment of a Cretaceous Dinosaur under the name Aachenosaurus multidens. By the examination of thin sections this supposed bone was shown to be a piece of Dicotyledonous wood(42). The methods of preservation of plants as fossils are numerous and varied and the few examples selected give but an incomplete idea of the subject: for a fuller treatment of fossilisation the reader is referred to more technical treatises (48 vol. I.). The employment of fossil plants as 'Thermometers of the ages' is a branch of Palaeobotany to which a passing allusion may be permitted though it is only indirectly connected with the main question. As one of the most interesting examples of changed climatic conditions revealed by a study of fossil plants, reference may be made to the wealth of material collected within the Arctic circle. The problems suggested by the discovery of plants in rocks of various ages in North Siberia, Spitzbergen, Franz Josef Land, Bear Island, Greenland, and in many other localities in the far north are too difficult and far-reaching to be discussed in these pages. In the Cretaceous and Tertiary strata of the west coast of Greenland and Disco Island from 69 to 72 north latitude, to refer only to one case, a great number of plants have been obtained by several of the earlier Arctic explorers and more recently by members of one of the Peary Expeditions. At the present day on the fringe of land on the western edge of Greenland which is not permanently covered with ice, a considerable number of herbaceous plants are able to exist and to produce seed during their concentrated period of development; while trees are represented only by a few low-growing shrubs such as the dwarf Juniper. In places accessible to investigation beyond the ice-covered hills of northern Greenland the rocks have been shown to consist of Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments containing fossil plants associated with seams of coal. From these beds numerous Dicotyledons have been obtained, some of them almost identical with living species characteristic of sub-tropical or tropical countries. In the lowest of the Cretaceous series no Dicotyledons have been found, but flowering plants are abundant in the higher Cretaceous rocks. Allowing for the fact that closely allied species are often able to","The remains of a rich Wealden flora have been collected from these Wealden sediments, notably from the plant-beds of Ecclesbourne near Hastings, in which, so far as we know, flowering plants played no part or at most occupied a very subordinate position. A few fossil leaves have been described from rocks assigned to a Wealden age,--and from the older Stonesfield Slate, of Jurassic age, a single leaf is recorded,--which seem to be those of Dicotyledons; but it is certain that even in the early days of the Cretaceous period the present dominant group in the plant kingdom was in its infancy and in many regions probably unrepresented.

This fossil resin occurs in Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Jurassic rocks; the amber found in abundance on the Baltic coast near Danzig and occasionally picked up on the beach in Norfolk and Suffolk comes from beds of Tertiary age. Pieces of Pine-wood have been described from the Baltic beds in which the tissues are perfectly preserved as the result of the conversion into amber of the resinous secretion which permeates their cells: in this case the amber is a petrifying agent. More frequently the preservation is due to incrustation; as resin trickled down the stems of the Tertiary pines from an open wound, flowers and leaves, blown by the wind on to the sticky surface, were eventually sealed up in a translucent case of amber. Though the actual substance may have gone, the mould which remains exhibits in wonderful perfection each separate organ of a flower or the delicate hair-clusters on the surface of a leaf. The flower represented in Fig. 8, a species of Cinnamon, is one of several specimens described by the authors of a monograph of Tertiary plants in the Baltic amber(41). The fragments of plants preserved in nodules of calcareous rock occasionally met with in some of the Lancashire and Yorkshire coal-seams are perhaps the most striking examples of the possibilities of petrifaction. By cutting sections of these nodules and grinding them to a transparent thinness, the most delicate tissues of Carboniferous plants are rendered accessible to investigation under the high power of a microscope. As our attention is absorbed by the examination of the details of cell-structure it is easy to forget that the section has not been cut from a living plant, but from the twig of a tree which grew in the forests of the Coal age. The preservation is such as to enable us not only to describe the anatomy of these extinct types of vegetation, but, by the application of the knowledge of the relation between the structure of the plant-machine and its functions gained by a study of living species, it is possible in some degree to picture the plants of the Coal period as living organisms and to see in the structural framework a reflection of external environment. The recognition in the general architectural plan of the Palaeozoic plants, as in many of the finer anatomical features, of the closest resemblance to plants of the modern world produces an almost overwhelming sense of continuity between the past and the present. The plants of the Palaeozoic period, though often differing considerably from those of the same class in the floras of to-day, exhibit a remarkably high type of organisation. Some of the most abundant trees in the forest of the Coal age are decidedly superior in the complexity of their structure, as also in size, to modern survivals of the same stock. On the other hand, it must be remembered that Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons which now occupy the highest place in the hierarchy of plants have left no sign of their existence in any of the Palaeozoic strata. The greater size of some of the Palaeozoic plants, and in some respects the more advanced stage of evolution which they represent as compared with their nearest relatives of the present era, must be considered in relation to their more important and relatively higher position in the plant-world than that which is now held by their diminutive descendants. It is, however, impossible to get away from the conclusion that the oldest Palaeozoic flora of which we have an intimate knowledge must be the product of development of an age which is represented by a chapter in the history of the plant kingdom at least as far removed from the beginning as it is separated from the chapter now being written. Examples might be quoted in illustration of the risks attending the determination of fossils by means of external features alone, but it may suffice to mention the case of a specimen originally described as a fragment of a Cretaceous Dinosaur under the name Aachenosaurus multidens. By the examination of thin sections this supposed bone was shown to be a piece of Dicotyledonous wood(42). The methods of preservation of plants as fossils are numerous and varied and the few examples selected give but an incomplete idea of the subject: for a fuller treatment of fossilisation the reader is referred to more technical treatises (48 vol. I.). The employment of fossil plants as 'Thermometers of the ages' is a branch of Palaeobotany to which a passing allusion may be permitted though it is only indirectly connected with the main question. As one of the most interesting examples of changed climatic conditions revealed by a study of fossil plants, reference may be made to the wealth of material collected within the Arctic circle. The problems suggested by the discovery of plants in rocks of various ages in North Siberia, Spitzbergen, Franz Josef Land, Bear Island, Greenland, and in many other localities in the far north are too difficult and far-reaching to be discussed in these pages. In the Cretaceous and Tertiary strata of the west coast of Greenland and Disco Island from 69 to 72 north latitude, to refer only to one case, a great number of plants have been obtained by several of the earlier Arctic explorers and more recently by members of one of the Peary Expeditions. At the present day on the fringe of land on the western edge of Greenland which is not permanently covered with ice, a considerable number of herbaceous plants are able to exist and to produce seed during their concentrated period of development; while trees are represented only by a few low-growing shrubs such as the dwarf Juniper. In places accessible to investigation beyond the ice-covered hills of northern Greenland the rocks have been shown to consist of Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments containing fossil plants associated with seams of coal. From these beds numerous Dicotyledons have been obtained, some of them almost identical with living species characteristic of sub-tropical or tropical countries. In the lowest of the Cretaceous series no Dicotyledons have been found, but flowering plants are abundant in the higher Cretaceous rocks."

In this life-cycle the seed plays no part. [2] The life-history of a Fern is clearly described by Prof. Bower in a recent volume in this series. It is noteworthy that the absence of any indication of spore-capsules and spores, in the case of some of the supposed fern leaves from the Coal-measures, caused some suspicion in the mind of an Austrian Palaeobotanist as to the right of such specimens to be classed among the ferns. This opinion, based in the first place on negative evidence and but little regarded by other authors, has in recent years been proved correct. In 1904 a paper was read before the Royal Society by Professor Oliver and Dr Scott(43) in which evidence was brought forward pointing to the conclusion that one of these generalised plants bore true seeds. Subsequently Dr Kidston published an account of some specimens of another of these Palaeozoic plants in which was actually shown an organic connexion between undoubted seeds and pieces of a fern-like frond(44). Without entering into further details, these and similar discoveries may be summarised as follows:--Many of the supposed Fern-fronds of Palaeozoic age, particularly those characteristic of the Coal-measures, are the leaves of plants which in their anatomical characters combined features now shared by true Ferns and by the Cycads. The reproductive organs of these Palaeozoic genera differed widely from those of existing ferns; the male organs, while not unlike the spore-capsules and spores of certain ferns, recall the male organs of living Conifers and Cycads, and the female organs were represented by seeds of a highly complex form. These seed-bearing plants have been called Pteridosperms, a name which expresses the combination of fern-like features with one of the distinguishing attributes of the higher plants, namely the possession of seeds. The ancestors of Pteridosperms are as yet unknown; it is, however, reasonable to assume that there existed in some pre-Carboniferous epoch a group of simple plants from which both Ferns and Pteridosperms were derived. In the forests of the Coal age true Ferns probably occupied a subordinate position in relation to the Pteridosperms. The question of the relationship between different families of recent ferns and the older known fossil members of the group is beyond the scope of this book. Evidence has been discovered in recent years which warrants the statement that, although none of those Carboniferous ferns were generically identical with existing forms, they very clearly foreshadowed some of those structural features which characterise more than one family of present-day Ferns. The records of the older Mesozoic formations afford abundant evidence of the existence of certain types of Ferns showing a very close resemblance to recent species. [Illustration: Fig. 9. Osmunda regalis Linn. Fertile frond, (2 5 nat. size.)] An enquiry into the geographical distribution of living Ferns reveals facts of special interest in connexion with the relative antiquity of different genera and families. The wide distribution of the Bracken fern has already been referred to: it is abundant in Tasmania; its vigour in the island is well illustrated by Mr Geoffrey Smith's statement that constant attention is necessary to keep it from invading newly opened country(45). On Mount Ophir in the Malay Peninsula the cosmopolitan bracken occurs in association with the two genera Matonia and Dipteris, ferns which are among the most striking examples of links with a remote past and have a restricted geographical range. With Osmunda regalis, the Royal Fern, the Bracken is conspicuous in the marsh vegetation of the Bermudas; it flourishes on the Atlas Mountains, in the Canary Islands, in Abyssinia, on Mt Kenia, in British East Africa, in the Himalayas, and is in fact generally distributed in the tropics in both the north and south temperate zones. The Royal Fern (Fig. 9) is another British species with a wide distribution; it occurs in Northern Asia and in North America; it is common in the Siberian forests and lives in several tropical countries, extending to Southern India and Cape Colony, and in South America it is represented by a closely allied species. Though at the present day Osmunda regalis is one of the rare English Ferns, its occurrence in the submerged forest-beds round our coasts and in pre-Glacial beds points to its former abundance in the British area generally. The Royal Fern is a member of a family now represented by two genera, Osmunda and Todea. With the exception of Todea barbara, with its large spreading fronds and a short root-covered stem, which occurs in Australia and Cape Colony, all the species of this genus are filmy ferns with semitransparent fronds adapted to a moisture-laden atmosphere. The maximum development of the genus is in New Zealand. Todea barbara affords an instance of discontinuous distribution; it was no doubt once widely spread in circumpolar regions and now survives only in South Africa and in Australia. There are satisfactory reasons for regarding the Bracken Fern, with its world-wide range in present-day floras, as a comparatively modern species now in full vigour. Its anatomical and other features are consistent with the view that it is a late product of evolution, and as yet no indication has been given by the records of the rocks of an ancient lineage. The Osmunda family, on the other hand, is undoubtedly an extremely old branch of the fern group. A comparison of the Royal Fern with the Bracken shows that their stems are constructed on very different plans, and we have good reasons for speaking of the structural peculiarities of the former as those of a more primitive type. Moreover, the discontinuous geographical range of some members of the Osmunda family is in itself an indication of antiquity. There is another point which may have a bearing in this question of antiquity, namely the fact that the spores of Osmunda are green and do not possess the powers of indurance inherent in the spores of the majority of ferns which are not green. It has recently been contended by Professor Campbell of Stanford University that the delicate green spores of the Liverworts, plants closely allied to the Mosses, constitute an argument in favour of the antiquity of these plants(46). Certain Liverworts are cosmopolitan in their range, e.g. the genera Riccia and Marchantia. If certain genera are widely distributed, notwithstanding the fact that their reproductive cells, by which dispersal is effected, are ill-adapted to withstand unfavourable conditions or to endure prolonged desiccation, it would seem reasonable to conclude that their emigration has been accomplished slowly and with difficulty. Ferns such as Osmunda, with green and short-lived spores, would thus be handicapped in competition with other genera provided with more efficient means of dispersal and better equipped for the vicissitudes of travel. The inferences as to antiquity deduced from a study of the existing species of Osmunda and Todea receive striking confirmation from the testimony of fossils. Some of the oldest known Palaeozoic ferns, though differing too widely from the existing Osmundas and Todeas to be included in the same family, afford distinct glimmerings of Osmundaceous characters, which at a later period became individualised in the direct ancestors of the modern forms. Our knowledge of the past history of the Osmunda family has recently been considerably extended and placed on a firmer basis by the researches of Dr Kidston and Professor Gwynne-Vaughan. These authors have recognised in some exceptionally well-preserved fern-stems from Permian rocks in Russia, anatomical features which point unmistakably to close relationship with the recent members of the family(47)(48). Passing higher up the geological series, fertile fern fronds with spore-capsules and spores practically identical with those of Osmunda have been found in the Jurassic plant-beds of Yorkshire and in rocks of approximately the same age in many parts of the world. From Jurassic strata in New Zealand a petrified fern-stem has been described (Osmundites Dunlopi), almost identical in structure with the surviving species. Cretaceous and Tertiary examples of similar ferns might be quoted; but enough has been said to establish the claim of the Royal Fern and other members of the Osmunda-family to an ancestry which possibly extends even farther back than that of any other existing family of Ferns. [Illustration: Fig. 10. Gleichenia dicarpa Br. (1 2 nat. size.)] A brief reference may be made to another fern now represented by several species widely disseminated in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The genus Gleichenia occurs abundantly in the warmer regions of both the Old and New World. The fronds may usually be recognised by their habit of growth (Fig. 10); in several species the main axis is repeatedly forked and a small bud between the divergent branches of the forks forms a characteristic feature. The leaflets are either long and narrow like the teeth of a comb or short and bluntly rounded. Moreover the anatomy of the creeping stem affords a ready means of identification. We have satisfactory evidence of the occurrence of Gleichenia in European floras during both the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Numerous fragments of plants were obtained some years ago, not far from Brussels, from the Wealden strata in which the famous skeletons of Iguanodon were discovered. Visitors to the Natural History Museum in Brussels are no doubt familiar with the skeletons of this enormous herbivorous animal: in the same gallery are exhibited the remains of the fossil plants from the Iguanodon beds. Some of these fragments are pieces of fern fronds identical in form with those of existing Gleichenias. The microscopical examination of some exceptionally well preserved fragments of Wealden stems discovered by Prof. Bommer of Brussels enabled him to recognise the Gleichenia type of structure and thus to confirm the inconclusive evidence furnished by fragmentary leaves. The most interesting records in regard to the former occurrence of Gleichenia in Northern Europe we owe to the late Oswald Heer of Zurich, who has described many examples of Gleichenia fronds from rocks of Lower Cretaceous age in Disco Island on the west coast of Greenland in latitude 70 N. The same type of fern is recorded also from upper Jurassic beds in the north-east of Scotland, in the Wealden rocks of Sussex, as well as from other European localities. It is clear that the Gleichenia-family, no longer represented in north temperate floras, was in the Jurassic period, and especially in the early days of the Cretaceous period, widely spread in Europe, extending well within the Arctic circle. It may be that the original home of Gleichenia was in the far North at a time when climatic conditions were very different from those which now prevail. Gleichenia, like many other northern plants, retreated to more southern regions where, in the warmer countries of the world, many species still flourish widely separated in space and time from the place of their birth. The ferns so far mentioned have a more or less extended distribution at the present day. In the case of Pteridium aquilinum, the cosmopolitan Bracken Fern, wide range would seem to be correlated with comparatively recent origin; on the other hand, the facts of palaeobotany show that the wide distribution of Osmunda, a type of fern which differs in many important respects from members of the family (Polypodiaceae) to which the Bracken belongs, is not inconsistent with an exceptionally ancient family-history. There are, however, certain genera of ferns which afford remarkable examples of restricted geographical distribution associated with great antiquity. The island of Juan Fernandez, 420 miles off the coast of Chili, the home for four years of Alexander Selkirk (to whose adventures we owe Defoe's creation of Robinson Crusoe), is interesting also from a botanical point of view. The vegetation of this oceanic island, 20 square miles in area with basaltic cliffs rising to a height of 3000 ft. above the sea, includes more than 40 species of ferns, eight of which occur nowhere else. One of these endemic ferns is Thyrsopteris elegans, the only representative of the genus; it is readily distinguished by its large and graceful fertile fronds, examples of which may occasionally be seen on a plant of this species in the Royal Gardens at Kew: the sporangia are produced in circular cups which replace the ordinary leaflets on the lower branches of the frond and hang from the short axis like miniature clusters of grapes. It is noteworthy that among the fragmentary remains of the fern vegetation of the Jurassic flora in England and in other parts of Europe specimens occur with fertile segments practically identical with those of the Juan Fernandez species. Students of fossil plants are occasionally led away by the temptation to identify imperfect specimens with rare existing species to which they exhibit a superficial resemblance, and this is well illustrated by the frequent use of the generic name Thyrsopteris for Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous ferns which are too imperfect to be determined with any degree of certainty We have, however, satisfactory grounds for the assertion that the Juan Fernandez fern affords a striking confirmation of the truth of Darwin's dictum that 'Rarity, as geology tells us, is the precursor to extinction.' In this remote oceanic island, for reasons which we cannot explain, there lingers an isolated type which belongs to another age. The following passage, which forms a fitting introduction to an account of two other genera of ancient ferns, is taken from a description of an ascent of Mount Ophir in the Malay Peninsula by Dr A. R. Wallace in his well-known book on the Malay Archipelago:--'After passing a little tangled jungle and swampy thickets, we emerged into a fine lofty forest.... We ascended steadily up a moderate slope for several miles, having a deep ravine on the left. We then had a level plateau or shoulder to cross, after which the ascent was steeper and the forest denser till we came out upon the Padang-Batu, or stone-field.... We found it to be a steep slope of even rock, extending along the mountain side farther than we could see. Parts of it were quite bare, but where it was cracked and fissured there grew a most luxuriant vegetation, among which the pitcher plants were the most remarkable.... A few coniferae of the genus Dacrydium here first appeared, and in the thickets, just above the rocky surface, we walked through groves of those splendid ferns, Dipteris Horsfieldii and Matonia pectinata, which bear large spreading fronds on slender stems, 6 or 8 feet high'(49). [Illustration: Fig. 11. Matonia pectinata. A group of plants in a wood on Gunong Tundok, Mount Ophir. (Photograph by Mr A. G. Tansley.)] The two genera Matonia and Dipteris afford exceptionally striking examples of survivals from the past. Matonia is represented by two species, Matonia pectinata (Fig. 11), which grows abundantly on the upper slopes of Padang-Batu in dense thickets on the rock faces where, as Mr Tansley states, its associates are a species of Gleichenia, Dipteris, and a little Pteridium aquilinum (Bracken Fern). Matonia pectinata occurs also on Bornean mountains at an altitude of over 3000 ft. and descends to the coast on some of the Malay islands. The other species of the genus, Matonia sarmentosa, has so far been found in one locality only, Niak, Sarawak, where it was discovered by Mr Charles Hose. Matonia pectinata has a creeping stem covered with a thick felt of brown hairs bearing tall fan-shaped fronds divided into numerous comb-like branches thickly set with narrow linear leaflets on which circular clusters of spore-capsules are sparsely scattered. In some respects Matonia is unlike other ferns; the fronds constitute a striking feature, and the anatomy of the stem is still more distinctive. In the form, development, and arrangement of the sporangia (spore-capsules)--organs which from the constancy of their characters have long been recognised as the most useful basis for classification--Matonia exhibits distinctive features. In order to emphasise the isolated position of the genus it has recently been placed in a separate family, the Matonineae, of which it is the sole living representative. The restricted geographical range of Matonia, considered in connexion with the clearly marked peculiarities in structure and form, leads us to expect other evidence in support of the natural inference that the genus is a survivor of a once more vigorous and widely spread family. If Matonia were a recently evolved type which has not spread far from its original home, we should expect it to conform more closely than it does to other ferns in the Malay region. Even assuming for the sake of argument that variation may occur per saltum, and new forms may be produced differing in more than the finer shades of small variation from their parents, the peculiar features of Matonia are too pronounced and its individual characteristics too obvious to warrant the assumption of recent production. It is, however, from the testimony of the rocks that we obtain confirmation of the opinion that these Malayan species are plants on the verge of extinction. In shales of Jurassic age exposed on the Yorkshire coast at Gristhorpe Bay and in iron-stained rocks of the same age between Whitby and Scarborough, well preserved leaves have been found agreeing in the shape of the frond, as also in the form of the leaflets and of the groups of sporangia which they bare, with those of Matonia pectinata. The exposure by a stroke of the hammer, on the fractured surface of a rock picked up on the beach at Hayburn Wyke (a few miles south of Whitby), of a piece of fern frond which is unmistakably closely allied to the species described by Wallace on Mount Ophir, establishes a link between the Jurassic and the present era and presents a fascinating problem in geographical distribution. These fossil Matonias are known to students of ancient plants as species of the genus Matonidium, a name adopted by a German botanist for specimens apparently identical with those from the Yorkshire coast discovered in slightly younger rocks (Wealden) in North Germany. The same type has been found also in sediments of Wealden age on the Sussex coast. Other leaf-impressions agreeing closely with those of Matonidium have been obtained from the Yorkshire Jurassic rocks and these are assigned to another genus Laccopteris, an extinct member of the family Matonineae. It is not merely in the habit of the fronds and in the shape and venation of the leaflets that these fossil ferns resemble the existing species, but the more important features exhibited by the spore-capsules supply additional evidence. It has already been pointed out that the stems of Matonia are characterised by a type of structure unknown in an identical form in any other recent fern. A few years ago Prof. Bommer discovered fragments of leaves and stems in Wealden beds a few miles from Brussels sufficiently well preserved to reveal the details of internal organisation. Some of these fossils were found to possess structural features identical with those of the Malayan species of Matonia. A full account of the fossil representatives of the Matonia family would be out of place in a general essay on Links with the Past, but brief reference may be made to some of the data which throw light on the geological history of the family. In strata classed by geologists as Rhaetic, a phase of earth-history between the Triassic and Jurassic eras (see p. 42), species of Laccopteris and allied forms have been described from several other countries; from Jurassic and Wealden strata ","In this life-cycle the seed plays no part. [2] The life-history of a Fern is clearly described by Prof. Bower in a recent volume in this series. It is noteworthy that the absence of any indication of spore-capsules and spores, in the case of some of the supposed fern leaves from the Coal-measures, caused some suspicion in the mind of an Austrian Palaeobotanist as to the right of such specimens to be classed among the ferns.

It is noteworthy that among the fragmentary remains of the fern vegetation of the Jurassic flora in England and in other parts of Europe specimens occur with fertile segments practically identical with those of the Juan Fernandez species. Students of fossil plants are occasionally led away by the temptation to identify imperfect specimens with rare existing species to which they exhibit a superficial resemblance, and this is well illustrated by the frequent use of the generic name Thyrsopteris for Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous ferns which are too imperfect to be determined with any degree of certainty We have, however, satisfactory grounds for the assertion that the Juan Fernandez fern affords a striking confirmation of the truth of Darwin's dictum that 'Rarity, as geology tells us, is the precursor to extinction.' In this remote oceanic island, for reasons which we cannot explain, there lingers an isolated type which belongs to another age. The following passage, which forms a fitting introduction to an account of two other genera of ancient ferns, is taken from a description of an ascent of Mount Ophir in the Malay Peninsula by Dr A. R. Wallace in his well-known book on the Malay Archipelago:--'After passing a little tangled jungle and swampy thickets, we emerged into a fine lofty forest.... We ascended steadily up a moderate slope for several miles, having a deep ravine on the left. We then had a level plateau or shoulder to cross, after which the ascent was steeper and the forest denser till we came out upon the Padang-Batu, or stone-field.... We found it to be a steep slope of even rock, extending along the mountain side farther than we could see. Parts of it were quite bare, but where it was cracked and fissured there grew a most luxuriant vegetation, among which the pitcher plants were the most remarkable.... A few coniferae of the genus Dacrydium here first appeared, and in the thickets, just above the rocky surface, we walked through groves of those splendid ferns, Dipteris Horsfieldii and Matonia pectinata, which bear large spreading fronds on slender stems, 6 or 8 feet high'(49). [Illustration: Fig. 11. Matonia pectinata. A group of plants in a wood on Gunong Tundok, Mount Ophir. (Photograph by Mr A. G. Tansley.)] The two genera Matonia and Dipteris afford exceptionally striking examples of survivals from the past. Matonia is represented by two species, Matonia pectinata (Fig. 11), which grows abundantly on the upper slopes of Padang-Batu in dense thickets on the rock faces where, as Mr Tansley states, its associates are a species of Gleichenia, Dipteris, and a little Pteridium aquilinum (Bracken Fern). Matonia pectinata occurs also on Bornean mountains at an altitude of over 3000 ft. and descends to the coast on some of the Malay islands. The other species of the genus, Matonia sarmentosa, has so far been found in one locality only, Niak, Sarawak, where it was discovered by Mr Charles Hose. Matonia pectinata has a creeping stem covered with a thick felt of brown hairs bearing tall fan-shaped fronds divided into numerous comb-like branches thickly set with narrow linear leaflets on which circular clusters of spore-capsules are sparsely scattered. In some respects Matonia is unlike other ferns; the fronds constitute a striking feature, and the anatomy of the stem is still more distinctive. In the form, development, and arrangement of the sporangia (spore-capsules)--organs which from the constancy of their characters have long been recognised as the most useful basis for classification--Matonia exhibits distinctive features. In order to emphasise the isolated position of the genus it has recently been placed in a separate family, the Matonineae, of which it is the sole living representative. The restricted geographical range of Matonia, considered in connexion with the clearly marked peculiarities in structure and form, leads us to expect other evidence in support of the natural inference that the genus is a survivor of a once more vigorous and widely spread family. If Matonia were a recently evolved type which has not spread far from its original home, we should expect it to conform more closely than it does to other ferns in the Malay region. Even assuming for the sake of argument that variation may occur per saltum, and new forms may be produced differing in more than the finer shades of small variation from their parents, the peculiar features of Matonia are too pronounced and its individual characteristics too obvious to warrant the assumption of recent production. It is, however, from the testimony of the rocks that we obtain confirmation of the opinion that these Malayan species are plants on the verge of extinction. In shales of Jurassic age exposed on the Yorkshire coast at Gristhorpe Bay and in iron-stained rocks of the same age between Whitby and Scarborough, well preserved leaves have been found agreeing in the shape of the frond, as also in the form of the leaflets and of the groups of sporangia which they bare, with those of Matonia pectinata. The exposure by a stroke of the hammer, on the fractured surface of a rock picked up on the beach at Hayburn Wyke (a few miles south of Whitby), of a piece of fern frond which is unmistakably closely allied to the species described by Wallace on Mount Ophir, establishes a link between the Jurassic and the present era and presents a fascinating problem in geographical distribution. These fossil Matonias are known to students of ancient plants as species of the genus Matonidium, a name adopted by a German botanist for specimens apparently identical with those from the Yorkshire coast discovered in slightly younger rocks (Wealden) in North Germany. The same type has been found also in sediments of Wealden age on the Sussex coast. Other leaf-impressions agreeing closely with those of Matonidium have been obtained from the Yorkshire Jurassic rocks and these are assigned to another genus Laccopteris, an extinct member of the family Matonineae. It is not merely in the habit of the fronds and in the shape and venation of the leaflets that these fossil ferns resemble the existing species, but the more important features exhibited by the spore-capsules supply additional evidence. It has already been pointed out that the stems of Matonia are characterised by a type of structure unknown in an identical form in any other recent fern. A few years ago Prof. Bommer discovered fragments of leaves and stems in Wealden beds a few miles from Brussels sufficiently well preserved to reveal the details of internal organisation. Some of these fossils were found to possess structural features identical with those of the Malayan species of Matonia. A full account of the fossil representatives of the Matonia family would be out of place in a general essay on Links with the Past, but brief reference may be made to some of the data which throw light on the geological history of the family."

It is, however, from the records of Jurassic rocks that we obtain the most satisfactory information as to the great antiquity and the very wide geographical range of the ancestors of the recent genus. The plant-beds of the Yorkshire coast afford clear evidence of the occurrence of Araucarian trees in the woodlands of the Jurassic period. Petrified wood has been found at Whitby, associated with jet, showing the minute structural characteristics of the surviving species of Araucarieae, and it is not improbable that some at least of the Whitby jet has been formed from the wood of Araucarian plants. The carbonised remains of leafy shoots preserved in the Jurassic shales near Scarborough and on other parts of the Yorkshire coast include twigs hardly distinguishable from those of Araucaria excelsa, though the resemblance of external form alone, especially in the case of foliage shoots, does not amount to proof of generic identity. We have, however, the much more trustworthy evidence of cones and seed-bearing scales in which the characteristic features of living species are clearly shown. Seed-bearing scales almost identical with those of Araucaria excelsa and other recent species have long been known from the Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire. From other parts of England where samples of Jurassic floras are preserved, as at Stonesfield in Oxfordshire, in Northamptonshire and elsewhere, equally striking examples of undoubted Araucarias have been found. Fig. 18 represents part of a large cone described in 1866 by Mr Carruthers from Jurassic rocks at Bruton in Somersetshire: this specimen, now in the British Museum, consists of one side of a spherical cone about 5 inches long and 5 inches broad; in size, as in the form of the seed-scales, it shows a striking likeness to the cones of the Australian species Araucaria Bidwillii, the Bunya Bunya of Queensland. Other equally convincing examples of Jurassic Araucarian cones and seeds may be seen in the museums of York and Northampton. On the north-east coast of Sutherland there is a narrow strip of Jurassic beds forming a low platform between the granitic and Old Red Sandstone hills and the sea. From these rocks Hugh Miller described several fossil plants in his Testimony of the Rocks, and an examination of a large collection obtained from this district by the late Dr Marcus Gunn shows that Miller was justified in speaking of Araucaria as a member of this northern flora. [Illustration: Fig. 18. Araucarites sphaerocarpus Carr. From Jurassic rocks at Bruton, Somersetshire. (British Museum, 2 3 nat. size.)] There is abundant evidence pointing to the existence in Britain during the Jurassic period, and in the early days of the Cretaceous epoch, of Araucarian trees which differed but slightly from the modern species confined to the southern hemisphere. In several localities in France, Germany, and other parts of the continent, Araucarian fossils have been recognised in Jurassic rocks. It is almost certain that some foliage shoots and imperfectly preserved cones described by Dr Nathorst from Upper Jurassic rocks in Spitzbergen were borne by a species of Araucaria. Cone-scales very similar to those from Yorkshire have been discovered in Wealden beds in Cape Colony, and Araucarian wood of Jurassic and Cretaceous age has been found in Madagascar. From Jurassic strata in India and Victoria (Australia), as well as from Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks in Virginia and elsewhere in the eastern United States, well preserved Araucarian fossils are recorded. In a collection of Jurassic plants, obtained a few years ago by the members of a Swedish Antarctic Expedition in Graham's Land, Dr Nathorst has recognised some cone-scales of Araucaria, which demonstrate a former extension of the family beyond the southern limits of South America. It is interesting to find that when we ascend higher in the geological series and pass beyond the Wealden strata to the Middle and Upper sub-divisions of the Cretaceous period, evidence of the wide geographical distribution of the Araucarieae is still abundant. Araucarian wood has been obtained in rocks classed as Upper Cretaceous in Egypt, in East Africa, in Dakota, and elsewhere. In the sedimentary rocks of the Tertiary period undoubted examples of Araucaria are less common, though there can be no doubt that the genus was much more widely spread then than it is at the present day. The well-known Tertiary plant-beds of Bournemouth have afforded specimens of foliage shoots which have been described as a species of Araucaria, though in the absence of well-preserved cones or petrified wood we must admit that the data are inconclusive. It is, however, legitimate to regard the striking similarity of the Bournemouth twigs to those of Araucaria excelsa and A. Cookii as constituting a fairly strong case in favour of the persistence of Araucaria in Western Europe up to the earlier stage of the Tertiary period. Araucarian wood of Tertiary age is recorded from India, while branches with broad leaves like those of Araucaria imbricata have been found in Seymour Island and the Magellan Straits, and specimens of Tertiary wood are described from Patagonia. At the other end of the world. Tertiary rocks on the west coast of Greenland have yielded fragments which may be referred with some hesitation to the genus Araucaria. A few words must be added in regard to the recent discovery by Professor Jeffrey and Dr Hollick of some very interesting Cretaceous specimens in New Jersey of well-preserved cone-scales and foliage shoots of extinct plants closely related to the existing species of Agathis(51). The American fossils are particularly valuable because their preservation admits of microscopical examination of the tissues. In Cretaceous rocks of Staten Island and in other localities on the eastern border of the northern United States, kite-shaped seed-bearing scales almost identical in form with those of recent species of Agathis are fairly common fossils. Similar specimens have long been known from Tertiary rocks in western Greenland. In the case of some of the American examples each scale bore three seeds instead of a single seed in living species: on account of this difference Prof. Jeffrey and Dr Hollick have adopted a distinct generic name, Protodammara. The foregoing sketch is necessarily far from complete, but it may serve as an illustration of the light which is thrown on the past history of recent plants by the investigation of the relics of ancient floras. The family Araucarieae now represented by a small number of species which, with the exception of the Andian and Brazilian Araucarias, are restricted to a small region in the southern hemisphere, was one of the most widely spread sections of the seed-bearing plants during the Mesozoic era. Ancestors of Araucaria must have been common trees in the European vegetation in Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous periods, and even as late as the Tertiary period there is evidence that representatives of the family still lingered in the north. One conclusion which seems almost unavoidable is that the species of Araucaria and Agathis that survive, in some cases only in one or two small islands in the South Pacific, have in the course of successive ages wandered from the other end of the world. Their migrations can be partially traced by the fragments embedded in Jurassic and later sediments, but we can only speculate as to the causes which have contributed to the changes in the fortunes of the family; how much influence may have been exerted by changes in physical conditions in the environment, and to what extent the production of more successful types may have been the dominant cause of the decline, it is impossible to say. One thing at least is certain, that few existing plants are better entitled to veneration as survivals from the past than are the living species of Araucaria. CHAPTER VIII THE MAIDEN HAIR TREE '...the trees That whisper round a temple become soon Dear as the temple's self.' Keats. The Maiden Hair tree of China and Japan, which was introduced into Europe early in the eighteenth century, has now become fairly well known. Though hardy in England, it requires warmer summers for full development and regular flowering. To botanists this Eastern tree is of peculiar interest, partly because of the isolated position it occupies in the plant-kingdom and partly by reason of its great antiquity. There is probably no other existing tree which has so strong a claim to be styled a 'living fossil,' to use a term applied by Darwin to survivals from the past. In 1712 the traveller Kaempfer proposed for this plant the generic name Ginkgo, and Linnaeus adopted this designation, adding the specific name biloba to denote the bisection of the wedge-shaped lamina of the leaf into two divergent segments. In 1777 the English botanist Sir J. E. Smith expressed his disapproval of what he called the uncouth name Ginkgo by substituting for Ginkgo biloba the title Salisburia adiantifolia, but as it is customary to retain names adopted or proposed by Linnaeus, the founder of the binominal system of nomenclature, the correct botanical designation of the maiden hair tree is Ginkgo biloba. Mere personal preference such as that of Sir J. E. Smith for Salisburia is not an adequate reason for rejecting an older name. [Illustration: Fig. 19. Ginkgo biloba Linn. (Slightly reduced.)] In its pyramidal habit Ginkgo agrees generally with the larch and other Conifers. Like the larch and cedar it possesses two kinds of foliage shoots, the more rapidly growing long shoots with scattered leaves and the much shorter dwarf-shoots which elongate slightly each year and bear several leaves crowded round their apex. The leaves (Fig. 19), which are shed each year, are similar in the cuneate form of the lamina and in the fan-like distribution of the forked veins, to the large leaflets of some species of maiden hair ferns: the thin lamina carried by a slender leaf-stalk is usually about 3 inches across, though in exceptional cases it may reach a breadth of 8 inches. The lamina is usually divided by a deep =V=-shaped sinus into two equal halves; it may be entire with an irregularly crenulate margin, or, on seedlings and vigorous long shoots, the lamina may be cut into several wedge-shaped segments. The male and female flowers are borne on separate trees; the male consists of a central axis giving off slender branches, each of which ends in a small terminal knot and two elliptical capsules in which the pollen is produced. The female flowers have a stouter axis which normally produces two seeds at the apex. The seed is encased in a green fleshy substance and, as in the fruit of a cherry or plum, the kernel is protected by a hard woody shell. In the form of the leaves and in the structure of the flowers Ginkgo presents features which clearly distinguish it from the Conifers, the class in which, until recently, it was included. In 1896 the Japanese botanist Hirase made the important discovery that the male reproductive cells of Ginkgo are large motile bodies provided with a spirally coiled band of minute cilia--delicate hairs which by their rapid lashing-movement propel the cell through water. In all Flowering Plants and in Conifers the male reproductive cells have no independent means of locomotion; they are carried to the female cell by the formation of a slender tube--the pollen-tube--produced by the pollen-grain. In the Ferns, Lycopods and Horsetails--in fact in all members of the Pteridophyta--as also in the Mosses and Liverworts as well as in many of the still lower plants, the male cells swim to the egg by the lashing of cilia like those on the male cells of Ginkgo. This difference in regard to the nature of the male cells was considered to be a fundamental distinction between the higher seed-bearing plants and all other groups of the vegetable kingdom. It was, therefore, with no ordinary interest that Hirase's discovery was received, as it broke down a distinction between the two great divisions of the plant-world which had been generally accepted as fundamental; though it is only fair to say that the German botanist Hofmeister, a man of exceptional originality and power of grasping the essential, foresaw the possibility that this arbitrary barrier would eventually be removed. The Ferns and other plants in which the male cells are motile, represent earlier stages in the progress of plant development, when the presence of water was essential for the act of fertilisation, a relic of earlier days when the whole plant-body was fitted for a life in water. As higher types were produced, the plant-machinery became less dependent on an aqueous habitat, and the loss of organs of locomotion in the male cells is an instance of the kind of change accompanying the gradual adaptation to life on land. The idea of the gradual emancipation of plants from a watery environment is expressed in a somewhat extreme form by the author of a book entitled The Lessons of Evolution(52), who states that the ocean is the mother of plant-life and that plants formed the army which conquered the land. In Ginkgo we have a type which, though similar in most respects to the Conifers, possesses in its motile reproductive cells a persistent inheritance from the past. The recognition of this special feature afforded a sound reason, especially when other peculiarities are considered, for removing Ginkgo from the Conifers and instituting a new class-name, Ginkgoales. Ginkgo is a generalised type, linked by different characters both with living members of the two classes of naked-seeded plants and with certain existing Palaeozoic genera. It is a survivor of a race which has narrowly escaped extinction; the last of a long line that has outlived its family and offers by its persistence an impressive instance of the past in the present. Though Mrs Bishop in her Untrodden Paths in Japan speaks of forests of Maiden Hair trees apparently in a wild state, it is generally believed that they were cultivated specimens. Mr Henry who has an exceptionally wide knowledge of Chinese vegetation tells us that 'all scientific travellers in Japan and the leading Japanese botanists and foresters deny its being indigenous in any part of Japan; and botanical collectors have not observed it truly wild in China.' Moreover, Mr E. H. Wilson, after traversing the whole of the district where Ginkgo was supposed to occur in a wild state, says that he found only cultivated trees. There is no reason to doubt that China is the last stronghold of this ancient type which in an earlier period of the earth's history overspread the world. A brief summary of the past history of Ginkgo and of the Ginkgoales supplies overwhelming testimony to the tenacity of life with which the Maiden Hair tree has persisted through the ages. It was pointed out in the account of the past history of Araucaria that the records obtained from Palaeozoic rocks, while affording evidence of the existence of Carboniferous and Permian genera undoubtedly allied to the living species, do not enable us to speak with certainty as to the precise degree of affinity. Similarly, Palaeozoic leaves have been described as representatives of the class of which Ginkgo is the sole survivor, but the evidence on which this relationship is assumed is by no means conclusive. The generic name Psygmophyllum has been applied to some impressions of Ginkgo-like leaves discovered in the Upper Devonian rocks of Bear Island, a small remnant of land in the Arctic circle, which has furnished valuable information as to the composition of one of the oldest floras of which satisfactory remains have been found. Other examples of these lobed, wedge-shaped leaves are recorded from Carboniferous rocks in Germany, France, and elsewhere; from Permian strata in the east of Russia and from Palaeozoic beds in Cape Colony and Kashmir. A relationship between Psygmophyllum and Ginkgo is, however, by no means established and rests solely on a resemblance in the form of the leaves. The close correspondence in form and venation between some leaves from Permian rocks in the Ural mountains and from Lower Permian beds in France, and those of the recent species, is considered by some authors sufficiently striking to justify the reference of these fossils to the genus Ginkgo. Similar leaves of Permian age, which may also be related to the existing species, have been described under the name Ginkgophyllum. Other specimens of Palaeozoic age from North America and elsewhere have been assigned to the Ginkgoales; but in none of these cases, despite the resemblance in leaf-form, is there sufficiently convincing evidence of close relationship to warrant a definite assertion that the plants in question were members of the group of which Ginkgo alone remains. It is, however, an undoubted fact that the Maiden Hair tree is connected by a long line of ancestors with the earliest phase of the Mesozoic era. From many parts of the world large collections of fossil plants have been obtained from strata referred to the Rhaetic period, or to the upper division of the Triassic system. A comparison of floras from these geological horizons in different parts of the world points to a vegetation extending from Australia, Cape Colony, and South America, to Tonkin, the south of Sweden and North America, which was characterised by a greater uniformity than is shown by widely separated floras at the present day. One of the commonest genera in Rhaetic floras is that known as Baiera; this name is applied to wedge-shaped leaves with a slender stalk similar in shape and venation to those of Ginkgo, but differing in the greater number and smaller breadth of the segments. Between the deeply dissected leaf of a typical Baiera with its narrow linear lobes and the entire or broadly lobed leaf of a Ginkgo there are many connecting links, and to some specimens either name might be applied with equal fitness. Examples of Baiera leaves, in some cases associated with fragments of reproductive organs, are recorded from Rhaetic rocks of France, the south of Sweden, Tonkin, Chili, the Argentine, North America, South Africa, and from other regions. There is abundant evidence pointing to the almost world-wide distribution of the Ginkgoales, as represented more especially by Baiera, in the older Mesozoic floras. In the later Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire true Ginkgo leaves as well as those of the Baiera type are fairly common; with the leaves have been found pieces of male and female flowers. Ginkgo and Baiera have been described from Jurassic rocks of Germany, France, Russia, Bornholm, and elsewhere in Europe; they occur abundantly in Middle Jurassic rocks in northern Siberia, and are represented in the Jurassic floras of Franz Josef Land, the East Coast of Greenland, and Spitzbergen (Fig. 20). The abundance of Ginkgo and Baiera leaves associated with male flowers and seeds discovered in Jurassic rocks, approximately of the same geological age as those on the Yorkshire coast, in East Siberia and in the Amur district, has led to the suggestion that this region may have been a centre where the Ginkgoales reached their maximum development in the Mesozoic period.

In 1896 the Japanese botanist Hirase made the important discovery that the male reproductive cells of Ginkgo are large motile bodies provided with a spirally coiled band of minute cilia--delicate hairs which by their rapid lashing-movement propel the cell through water. In all Flowering Plants and in Conifers the male reproductive cells have no independent means of locomotion; they are carried to the female cell by the formation of a slender tube--the pollen-tube--produced by the pollen-grain. In the Ferns, Lycopods and Horsetails--in fact in all members of the Pteridophyta--as also in the Mosses and Liverworts as well as in many of the still lower plants, the male cells swim to the egg by the lashing of cilia like those on the male cells of Ginkgo. This difference in regard to the nature of the male cells was considered to be a fundamental distinction between the higher seed-bearing plants and all other groups of the vegetable kingdom. It was, therefore, with no ordinary interest that Hirase's discovery was received, as it broke down a distinction between the two great divisions of the plant-world which had been generally accepted as fundamental; though it is only fair to say that the German botanist Hofmeister, a man of exceptional originality and power of grasping the essential, foresaw the possibility that this arbitrary barrier would eventually be removed. The Ferns and other plants in which the male cells are motile, represent earlier stages in the progress of plant development, when the presence of water was essential for the act of fertilisation, a relic of earlier days when the whole plant-body was fitted for a life in water. As higher types were produced, the plant-machinery became less dependent on an aqueous habitat, and the loss of organs of locomotion in the male cells is an instance of the kind of change accompanying the gradual adaptation to life on land. The idea of the gradual emancipation of plants from a watery environment is expressed in a somewhat extreme form by the author of a book entitled The Lessons of Evolution(52), who states that the ocean is the mother of plant-life and that plants formed the army which conquered the land. In Ginkgo we have a type which, though similar in most respects to the Conifers, possesses in its motile reproductive cells a persistent inheritance from the past. The recognition of this special feature afforded a sound reason, especially when other peculiarities are considered, for removing Ginkgo from the Conifers and instituting a new class-name, Ginkgoales. Ginkgo is a generalised type, linked by different characters both with living members of the two classes of naked-seeded plants and with certain existing Palaeozoic genera. It is a survivor of a race which has narrowly escaped extinction; the last of a long line that has outlived its family and offers by its persistence an impressive instance of the past in the present. Though Mrs Bishop in her Untrodden Paths in Japan speaks of forests of Maiden Hair trees apparently in a wild state, it is generally believed that they were cultivated specimens. Mr Henry who has an exceptionally wide knowledge of Chinese vegetation tells us that 'all scientific travellers in Japan and the leading Japanese botanists and foresters deny its being indigenous in any part of Japan; and botanical collectors have not observed it truly wild in China.' Moreover, Mr E. H. Wilson, after traversing the whole of the district where Ginkgo was supposed to occur in a wild state, says that he found only cultivated trees. There is no reason to doubt that China is the last stronghold of this ancient type which in an earlier period of the earth's history overspread the world. A brief summary of the past history of Ginkgo and of the Ginkgoales supplies overwhelming testimony to the tenacity of life with which the Maiden Hair tree has persisted through the ages. It was pointed out in the account of the past history of Araucaria that the records obtained from Palaeozoic rocks, while affording evidence of the existence of Carboniferous and Permian genera undoubtedly allied to the living species, do not enable us to speak with certainty as to the precise degree of affinity. Similarly, Palaeozoic leaves have been described as representatives of the class of which Ginkgo is the sole survivor, but the evidence on which this relationship is assumed is by no means conclusive. The generic name Psygmophyllum has been applied to some impressions of Ginkgo-like leaves discovered in the Upper Devonian rocks of Bear Island, a small remnant of land in the Arctic circle, which has furnished valuable information as to the composition of one of the oldest floras of which satisfactory remains have been found. Other examples of these lobed, wedge-shaped leaves are recorded from Carboniferous rocks in Germany, France, and elsewhere; from Permian strata in the east of Russia and from Palaeozoic beds in Cape Colony and Kashmir. A relationship between Psygmophyllum and Ginkgo is, however, by no means established and rests solely on a resemblance in the form of the leaves. The close correspondence in form and venation between some leaves from Permian rocks in the Ural mountains and from Lower Permian beds in France, and those of the recent species, is considered by some authors sufficiently striking to justify the reference of these fossils to the genus Ginkgo. Similar leaves of Permian age, which may also be related to the existing species, have been described under the name Ginkgophyllum. Other specimens of Palaeozoic age from North America and elsewhere have been assigned to the Ginkgoales; but in none of these cases, despite the resemblance in leaf-form, is there sufficiently convincing evidence of close relationship to warrant a definite assertion that the plants in question were members of the group of which Ginkgo alone remains. It is, however, an undoubted fact that the Maiden Hair tree is connected by a long line of ancestors with the earliest phase of the Mesozoic era. From many parts of the world large collections of fossil plants have been obtained from strata referred to the Rhaetic period, or to the upper division of the Triassic system. A comparison of floras from these geological horizons in different parts of the world points to a vegetation extending from Australia, Cape Colony, and South America, to Tonkin, the south of Sweden and North America, which was characterised by a greater uniformity than is shown by widely separated floras at the present day. One of the commonest genera in Rhaetic floras is that known as Baiera; this name is applied to wedge-shaped leaves with a slender stalk similar in shape and venation to those of Ginkgo, but differing in the greater number and smaller breadth of the segments. Between the deeply dissected leaf of a typical Baiera with its narrow linear lobes and the entire or broadly lobed leaf of a Ginkgo there are many connecting links, and to some specimens either name might be applied with equal fitness. Examples of Baiera leaves, in some cases associated with fragments of reproductive organs, are recorded from Rhaetic rocks of France, the south of Sweden, Tonkin, Chili, the Argentine, North America, South Africa, and from other regions. There is abundant evidence pointing to the almost world-wide distribution of the Ginkgoales, as represented more especially by Baiera, in the older Mesozoic floras. In the later Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire true Ginkgo leaves as well as those of the Baiera type are fairly common; with the leaves have been found pieces of male and female flowers. Ginkgo and Baiera have been described from Jurassic rocks of Germany, France, Russia, Bornholm, and elsewhere in Europe; they occur abundantly in Middle Jurassic rocks in northern Siberia, and are represented in the Jurassic floras of Franz Josef Land, the East Coast of Greenland, and Spitzbergen (Fig. 20). The abundance of Ginkgo and Baiera leaves associated with male flowers and seeds discovered in Jurassic rocks, approximately of the same geological age as those on the Yorkshire coast, in East Siberia and in the Amur district, has led to the suggestion that this region may have been a centre where the Ginkgoales reached their maximum development in the Mesozoic period.

Seward__A__C___Albert_Charles_,62521_LinksWiththe.txt,3,"h more trustworthy evidence of cones and seed-bearing scales in which the characteristic features of living species are clearly shown. Seed-bearing scales almost identical with those of Araucaria excelsa and other recent species have long been known from the Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire. From other parts of England where samples of Jurassic floras are preserved, as at Stonesfield in Oxfordshire, in Northamptonshire and elsewhere, equally striking examples of undoubted Araucarias have been found. Fig. 18 represents part of a large cone described in 1866 by Mr Carruthers from Jurassic rocks at Bruton in Somersetshire: this specimen, now in the British Museum, consists of one side of a spherical cone about 5 inches long and 5 inches broad; in size, as in the form of the seed-scales, it shows a striking likeness to the cones of the Australian species Araucaria Bidwillii, the Bunya Bunya of Queensland. Other equally convincing examples of Jurassic Araucarian cones and seeds may be seen in the museums of York and Northampton. On the north-east coast of Sutherland there is a narrow strip of Jurassic beds forming a low platform between the granitic and Old Red Sandstone hills and the sea. From these rocks Hugh Miller described several fossil plants in his Testimony of the Rocks, and an examination of a large collection obtained from this district by the late Dr Marcus Gunn shows that Miller was justified in speaking of Araucaria as a member of this northern flora. [Illustration: Fig. 18. Araucarites sphaerocarpus Carr. From Jurassic rocks at Bruton, Somersetshire. (British Museum, 2 3 nat. size.)] There is abundant evidence pointing to the existence in Britain during the Jurassic period, and in the early days of the Cretaceous epoch, of Araucarian trees which differed but slightly from the modern species confined to the southern hemisphere. In several localities in France, Germany, and other parts of the continent, Araucarian fossils have been recognised in Jurassic rocks. It is almost certain that some foliage shoots and imperfectly preserved cones described by Dr Nathorst from Upper Jurassic rocks in Spitzbergen were borne by a species of Araucaria. Cone-scales very similar to those from Yorkshire have been discovered in Wealden beds in Cape Colony, and Araucarian wood of Jurassic and Cretaceous age has been found in Madagascar. From Jurassic strata in India and Victoria (Australia), as well as from Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks in Virginia and elsewhere in the eastern United States, well preserved Araucarian fossils are recorded. In a collection of Jurassic plants, obtained a few years ago by the members of a Swedish Antarctic Expedition in Graham's Land, Dr Nathorst has recognised some cone-scales of Araucaria, which demonstrate a former extension of the family beyond the southern limits of South America. It is interesting to find that when we ascend higher in the geological series and pass beyond the Wealden strata to the Middle and Upper sub-divisions of the Cretaceous period, evidence of the wide geographical distribution of the Araucarieae is still abundant. Araucarian wood has been obtained in rocks classed as Upper Cretaceous in Egypt, in East Africa, in Dakota, and elsewhere. In the sedimentary rocks of the Tertiary period undoubted examples of Araucaria are less common, though there can be no doubt that the genus was much more widely spread then than it is at the present day. The well-known Tertiary plant-beds of Bournemouth have afforded specimens of foliage shoots which have been described as a species of Araucaria, though in the absence of well-preserved cones or petrified wood we must admit that the data are inconclusive. It is, however, legitimate to regard the striking similarity of the Bournemouth twigs to those of Araucaria excelsa and A. Cookii as constituting a fairly strong case in favour of the persistence of Araucaria in Western Europe up to the earlier stage of the Tertiary period. Araucarian wood of Tertiary age is recorded from India, while branches with broad leaves like those of Araucaria imbricata have been found in Seymour Island and the Magellan Straits, and specimens of Tertiary wood are described from Patagonia. At the other end of the world. Tertiary rocks on the west coast of Greenland have yielded fragments which may be referred with some hesitation to the genus Araucaria. A few words must be added in regard to the recent discovery by Professor Jeffrey and Dr Hollick of some very interesting Cretaceous specimens in New Jersey of well-preserved cone-scales and foliage shoots of extinct plants closely related to the existing species of Agathis(51). The American fossils are particularly valuable because their preservation admits of microscopical examination of the tissues. In Cretaceous rocks of Staten Island and in other localities on the eastern border of the northern United States, kite-shaped seed-bearing scales almost identical in form with those of recent species of Agathis are fairly common fossils. Similar specimens have long been known from Tertiary rocks in western Greenland. In the case of some of the American examples each scale bore three seeds instead of a single seed in living species: on account of this difference Prof. Jeffrey and Dr Hollick have adopted a distinct generic name, Protodammara. The foregoing sketch is necessarily far from complete, but it may serve as an illustration of the light which is thrown on the past history of recent plants by the investigation of the relics of ancient floras. The family Araucarieae now represented by a small number of species which, with the exception of the Andian and Brazilian Araucarias, are restricted to a small region in the southern hemisphere, was one of the most widely spread sections of the seed-bearing plants during the Mesozoic era. Ancestors of Araucaria must have been common trees in the European vegetation in Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous periods, and even as late as the Tertiary period there is evidence that representatives of the family still lingered in the north. One conclusion which seems almost unavoidable is that the species of Araucaria and Agathis that survive, in some cases only in one or two small islands in the South Pacific, have in the course of successive ages wandered from the other end of the world. Their migrations can be partially traced by the fragments embedded in Jurassic and later sediments, but we can only speculate as to the causes which have contributed to the changes in the fortunes of the family; how much influence may have been exerted by changes in physical conditions in the environment, and to what extent the production of more successful types may have been the dominant cause of the decline, it is impossible to say. One thing at least is certain, that few existing plants are better entitled to veneration as survivals from the past than are the living species of Araucaria. CHAPTER VIII THE MAIDEN HAIR TREE '...the trees That whisper round a temple become soon Dear as the temple's self.' Keats. The Maiden Hair tree of China and Japan, which was introduced into Europe early in the eighteenth century, has now become fairly well known. Though hardy in England, it requires warmer summers for full development and regular flowering. To botanists this Eastern tree is of peculiar interest, partly because of the isolated position it occupies in the plant-kingdom and partly by reason of its great antiquity. There is probably no other existing tree which has so strong a claim to be styled a 'living fossil,' to use a term applied by Darwin to survivals from the past. In 1712 the traveller Kaempfer proposed for this plant the generic name Ginkgo, and Linnaeus adopted this designation, adding the specific name biloba to denote the bisection of the wedge-shaped lamina of the leaf into two divergent segments. In 1777 the English botanist Sir J. E. Smith expressed his disapproval of what he called the uncouth name Ginkgo by substituting for Ginkgo biloba the title Salisburia adiantifolia, but as it is customary to retain names adopted or proposed by Linnaeus, the founder of the binominal system of nomenclature, the correct botanical designation of the maiden hair tree is Ginkgo biloba. Mere personal preference such as that of Sir J. E. Smith for Salisburia is not an adequate reason for rejecting an older name. [Illustration: Fig. 19. Ginkgo biloba Linn. (Slightly reduced.)] In its pyramidal habit Ginkgo agrees generally with the larch and other Conifers. Like the larch and cedar it possesses two kinds of foliage shoots, the more rapidly growing long shoots with scattered leaves and the much shorter dwarf-shoots which elongate slightly each year and bear several leaves crowded round their apex. The leaves (Fig. 19), which are shed each year, are similar in the cuneate form of the lamina and in the fan-like distribution of the forked veins, to the large leaflets of some species of maiden hair ferns: the thin lamina carried by a slender leaf-stalk is usually about 3 inches across, though in exceptional cases it may reach a breadth of 8 inches. The lamina is usually divided by a deep =V=-shaped sinus into two equal halves; it may be entire with an irregularly crenulate margin, or, on seedlings and vigorous long shoots, the lamina may be cut into several wedge-shaped segments. The male and female flowers are borne on separate trees; the male consists of a central axis giving off slender branches, each of which ends in a small terminal knot and two elliptical capsules in which the pollen is produced. The female flowers have a stouter axis which normally produces two seeds at the apex. The seed is encased in a green fleshy substance and, as in the fruit of a cherry or plum, the kernel is protected by a hard woody shell. In the form of the leaves and in the structure of the flowers Ginkgo presents features which clearly distinguish it from the Conifers, the class in which, until recently, it was included.

There is, however, good reason to believe that this widespread group was represented by several genera in the older Mesozoic floras. The occurrence of the Ginkgoales in Jurassic rocks in King Charles Land and in the New Siberian Islands (lat. 78 and 75 N.), in Central China, Japan, Turkestan, California, Oregon, South Africa, Australia, and Graham's Land demonstrates the cosmopolitan nature of the group. During the later part of the Jurassic period and in the Wealden floras both Baiera and Ginkgo were abundant; leaves are recorded from Jurassic strata in the north-east of Scotland, from Lower Cretaceous or Wealden rocks in North Germany, Portugal, Vancouver Island, Wyoming, and Greenland. During the Tertiary period, or probably in the earlier days of that era. Ginkgo flourished in North America, in Alaska and in the Mackenzie River district, Greenland, Saghalien Island, and in several European regions. In Chapter III reference was made to the vol","Seed-bearing scales almost identical with those of Araucaria excelsa and other recent species have long been known from the Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire.

The male and female flowers are borne on separate trees; the male consists of a central axis giving off slender branches, each of which ends in a small terminal knot and two elliptical capsules in which the pollen is produced. The female flowers have a stouter axis which normally produces two seeds at the apex. The seed is encased in a green fleshy substance and, as in the fruit of a cherry or plum, the kernel is protected by a hard woody shell. In the form of the leaves and in the structure of the flowers Ginkgo presents features which clearly distinguish it from the Conifers, the class in which, until recently, it was included. In 1896 the Japanese botanist Hirase made the important discovery that the male reproductive cells of Ginkgo are large motile bodies provided with a spirally coiled band of minute cilia--delicate hairs which by their rapid lashing-movement propel the cell through water. In all Flowering Plants and in Conifers the male reproductive cells have no independent means of locomotion; they are carried to the female cell by the formation of a slender tube--the pollen-tube--produced by the pollen-grain. In the Ferns, Lycopods and Horsetails--in fact in all members of the Pteridophyta--as also in the Mosses and Liverworts as well as in many of the still lower plants, the male cells swim to the egg by the lashing of cilia like those on the male cells of Ginkgo. This difference in regard to the nature of the male cells was considered to be a fundamental distinction between the higher seed-bearing plants and all other groups of the vegetable kingdom. It was, therefore, with no ordinary interest that Hirase's discovery was received, as it broke down a distinction between the two great divisions of the plant-world which had been generally accepted as fundamental; though it is only fair to say that the German botanist Hofmeister, a man of exceptional originality and power of grasping the essential, foresaw the possibility that this arbitrary barrier would eventually be removed. The Ferns and other plants in which the male cells are motile, represent earlier stages in the progress of plant development, when the presence of water was essential for the act of fertilisation, a relic of earlier days when the whole plant-body was fitted for a life in water. As higher types were produced, the plant-machinery became less dependent on an aqueous habitat, and the loss of organs of locomotion in the male cells is an instance of the kind of change accompanying the gradual adaptation to life on land. The idea of the gradual emancipation of plants from a watery environment is expressed in a somewhat extreme form by the author of a book entitled The Lessons of Evolution(52), who states that the ocean is the mother of plant-life and that plants formed the army which conquered the land. In Ginkgo we have a type which, though similar in most respects to the Conifers, possesses in its motile reproductive cells a persistent inheritance from the past. The recognition of this special feature afforded a sound reason, especially when other peculiarities are considered, for removing Ginkgo from the Conifers and instituting a new class-name, Ginkgoales. Ginkgo is a generalised type, linked by different characters both with living members of the two classes of naked-seeded plants and with certain existing Palaeozoic genera. It is a survivor of a race which has narrowly escaped extinction; the last of a long line that has outlived its family and offers by its persistence an impressive instance of the past in the present. Though Mrs Bishop in her Untrodden Paths in Japan speaks of forests of Maiden Hair trees apparently in a wild state, it is generally believed that they were cultivated specimens. Mr Henry who has an exceptionally wide knowledge of Chinese vegetation tells us that 'all scientific travellers in Japan and the leading Japanese botanists and foresters deny its being indigenous in any part of Japan; and botanical collectors have not observed it truly wild in China.' Moreover, Mr E. H. Wilson, after traversing the whole of the district where Ginkgo was supposed to occur in a wild state, says that he found only cultivated trees. There is no reason to doubt that China is the last stronghold of this ancient type which in an earlier period of the earth's history overspread the world. A brief summary of the past history of Ginkgo and of the Ginkgoales supplies overwhelming testimony to the tenacity of life with which the Maiden Hair tree has persisted through the ages. It was pointed out in the account of the past history of Araucaria that the records obtained from Palaeozoic rocks, while affording evidence of the existence of Carboniferous and Permian genera undoubtedly allied to the living species, do not enable us to speak with certainty as to the precise degree of affinity. Similarly, Palaeozoic leaves have been described as representatives of the class of which Ginkgo is the sole survivor, but the evidence on which this relationship is assumed is by no means conclusive. The generic name Psygmophyllum has been applied to some impressions of Ginkgo-like leaves discovered in the Upper Devonian rocks of Bear Island, a small remnant of land in the Arctic circle, which has furnished valuable information as to the composition of one of the oldest floras of which satisfactory remains have been found. Other examples of these lobed, wedge-shaped leaves are recorded from Carboniferous rocks in Germany, France, and elsewhere; from Permian strata in the east of Russia and from Palaeozoic beds in Cape Colony and Kashmir. A relationship between Psygmophyllum and Ginkgo is, however, by no means established and rests solely on a resemblance in the form of the leaves. The close correspondence in form and venation between some leaves from Permian rocks in the Ural mountains and from Lower Permian beds in France, and those of the recent species, is considered by some authors sufficiently striking to justify the reference of these fossils to the genus Ginkgo. Similar leaves of Permian age, which may also be related to the existing species, have been described under the name Ginkgophyllum. Other specimens of Palaeozoic age from North America and elsewhere have been assigned to the Ginkgoales; but in none of these cases, despite the resemblance in leaf-form, is there sufficiently convincing evidence of close relationship to warrant a definite assertion that the plants in question were members of the group of which Ginkgo alone remains. It is, however, an undoubted fact that the Maiden Hair tree is connected by a long line of ancestors with the earliest phase of the Mesozoic era. From many parts of the world large collections of fossil plants have been obtained from strata referred to the Rhaetic period, or to the upper division of the Triassic system. A comparison of floras from these geological horizons in different parts of the world points to a vegetation extending from Australia, Cape Colony, and South America, to Tonkin, the south of Sweden and North America, which was characterised by a greater uniformity than is shown by widely separated floras at the present day. One of the commonest genera in Rhaetic floras is that known as Baiera; this name is applied to wedge-shaped leaves with a slender stalk similar in shape and venation to those of Ginkgo, but differing in the greater number and smaller breadth of the segments. Between the deeply dissected leaf of a typical Baiera with its narrow linear lobes and the entire or broadly lobed leaf of a Ginkgo there are many connecting links, and to some specimens either name might be applied with equal fitness. Examples of Baiera leaves, in some cases associated with fragments of reproductive organs, are recorded from Rhaetic rocks of France, the south of Sweden, Tonkin, Chili, the Argentine, North America, South Africa, and from other regions. There is abundant evidence pointing to the almost world-wide distribution of the Ginkgoales, as represented more especially by Baiera, in the older Mesozoic floras. In the later Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire true Ginkgo leaves as well as those of the Baiera type are fairly common; with the leaves have been found pieces of male and female flowers. Ginkgo and Baiera have been described from Jurassic rocks of Germany, France, Russia, Bornholm, and elsewhere in Europe; they occur abundantly in Middle Jurassic rocks in northern Siberia, and are represented in the Jurassic floras of Franz Josef Land, the East Coast of Greenland, and Spitzbergen (Fig. 20). The abundance of Ginkgo and Baiera leaves associated with male flowers and seeds discovered in Jurassic rocks, approximately of the same geological age as those on the Yorkshire coast, in East Siberia and in the Amur district, has led to the suggestion that this region may have been a centre where the Ginkgoales reached their maximum development in the Mesozoic period. [Illustration: Fig. 20. Fossil Ginkgo leaves. (1 2 nat. size.) A. Tertiary, Island of Mull. B. Wealden, North Germany (after Schenk). C. Jurassic, Japan (after Yokoyama). D.

Jurassic, Spitzbergen (after Heer). ] It should be added that other genera of Jurassic and Rhaetic fossils in addition to Ginkgo and Baiera have been referred to the Ginkgoales, though evidence of such affinity is not convincing. There is, however, good reason to believe that this widespread group was represented by several genera in the older Mesozoic floras. The occurrence of the Ginkgoales in Jurassic rocks in King Charles Land and in the New Siberian Islands (lat. 78 and 75 N.), in Central China, Japan, Turkestan, California, Oregon, South Africa, Australia, and Graham's Land demonstrates the cosmopolitan nature of the group. During the later part of the Jurassic period and in the Wealden floras both Baiera and Ginkgo were abundant; leaves are recorded from Jurassic strata in the north-east of Scotland, from Lower Cretaceous or Wealden rocks in North Germany, Portugal, Vancouver Island, Wyoming, and Greenland. During the Tertiary period, or probably in the earlier days of that era. Ginkgo flourished in North America, in Alaska and in the Mackenzie River district, Greenland, Saghalien Island, and in several European regions."
Seward__A__C___Albert_Charles_,62521_LinksWiththe.txt,4,"uri forests of New Zealand, buried stems point to a wider extension of the forests in earlier days. The sharp and thick leaves of the Monkey Puzzle distinguish it from all other Conifers; its large almost spherical seed-bearing cones, more than half a foot in length, which may occasionally be seen on well-grown British trees, are unlike those of other genera. Each of the deep and narrow scales bears a single seed embedded in the substance of the scale and terminates distally in a narrow upturned process. Some species of Araucaria, differing considerably in the form of the leaves and in the shape and structure of the seed-scales from the Chilian species, are conveniently placed in a distinct sub-division of the genus Araucaria. Of this type the Norfolk Island Pine, Araucaria excelsa, is the best-known example (Fig. 17). It was introduced to Kew by Sir Joseph Banks in 1793, soon after its discovery by Captain Cook, who describes the stems of the Norfolk Island trees as resembling basaltic columns, and relates how on approaching the island everyone was satisfied that the columnar objects were trees, 'except our Philosophers, who still maintained they were basaltes.' The leaves are short, about half an inch long, laterally compressed and slightly spreading and sickle-shaped--sometimes shorter and broader and overlapping--arranged in crowded spirals. The scales of the broadly oval cones are single-seeded, but differ from those of Araucaria imbricata in having the seed exposed on the surface and in the greater breadth and thinner borders of the scales. In both Araucaria and Agathis the nature of the seed-scales constitutes a distinguishing feature. The leaves of Araucaria imbricata differ in form from those of other Conifers. The foliage shoots of Araucaria excelsa and other species, e.g. the very closely allied A. Cookii of the New Hebrides and New Caledonia, though not unlike the branches of a Japanese Conifer (Cryptomeria japonica), often cultivated in England, afford fairly trustworthy characters for identification purposes. The minute structure of the wood of both Araucaria and Agathis constitutes an important distinguishing feature and enables us to recognise on microscopical examination even a fragment of wood of either of these genera. The small elongated cells or water-conducting elements of the wood of the Araucarieae are characterised by one or two, and occasionally as many as three or four, contiguous rows of pits on their radial walls, and these appear in surface view as flattened circles or polygonal areas. These details have been mentioned in order to show that Araucaria and Agathis are sufficiently distinct in many respects from other Conifers to render their identification in a fossil state comparatively easy, at least much easier than the recognition of the majority of the members of the Coniferae. It would be going too far to state definitely that Araucarieae, as defined by reference to existing species, existed during the Palaeozoic period; on the other hand it would seem in a high degree probable that the vegetation of the Coal age and of the succeeding Permian period included trees in which certain Araucarian characters were clearly foreshadowed. The name Araucarioxylon was formerly applied to petrified wood, obtained from Palaeozoic as well as from later formations, which agrees anatomically with that of Araucaria and Agathis. It has been shown in recent years that much of the Palaeozoic wood of this type of structure belongs to the extinct genus Cordaites, a tree which played a prominent part in the earlier floras. Cordaites affords a good example of a generalised type: in its wood-structure it resembles very closely the existing Araucarieae; its long strap-like leaves are not unlike those of some species of Agathis; its male flowers have often been compared with those of the Maiden Hair tree, Ginkgo biloba, and certain anatomical features form connecting links between this Palaeozoic genus and the Cycads. It is noteworthy that in another Palaeozoic genus, Walchia, the leaf-bearing branches are identical in appearance with those of the Norfolk Island Pine (Fig. 17) and some other species of Araucaria. Unfortunately our knowledge of the reproductive organs of Walchia is insufficient to warrant any definite statement as to the degree of consanguinity between this Permian and Upper Carboniferous plant and the Araucarieae; it is probable that in Walchia we have a type not far removed from the line of evolution which led to Araucaria. Petrified wood, identified as that of Walchia, and exhibiting the Araucarian type of structure, has been recorded from Permian rocks of the Vosges. Other instances might be quoted in support of the view that the Palaeozoic floras included a few plants with which the surviving Araucarieae may fairly claim relationship. Professor Zeiller of Paris has recently described some fossil shoots from Palaeozoic rocks in India under the name Araucarites Oldhami on the ground of the similarity of the leaves to those of Araucaria imbricata. Similarly, from Triassic rocks several fossils have been described as closely allied to Araucaria, in some cases because of anatomical resemblances and in others on the less satisfactory evidence furnished by a similarity in the foliage shoots. Professor Jeffrey of Harvard has recently given an account of a new type of stem (Woodworthia) from the petrified Triassic forest of Arizona possessing some Araucarian characters, though differing from existing species of Araucaria in certain structural features, a combination of characters regarded by this Author as an indication of relationship with the family of Conifers, which includes the Pines, Firs, Larches and other well-known northern genera. It is, however, from the records of Jurassic rocks that we obtain the most satisfactory information as to the great antiquity and the very wide geographical range of the ancestors of the recent genus. The plant-beds of the Yorkshire coast afford clear evidence of the occurrence of Araucarian trees in the woodlands of the Jurassic period. Petrified wood has been found at Whitby, associated with jet, showing the minute structural characteristics of the surviving species of Araucarieae, and it is not improbable that some at least of the Whitby jet has been formed from the wood of Araucarian plants. The carbonised remains of leafy shoots preserved in the Jurassic shales near Scarborough and on other parts of the Yorkshire coast include twigs hardly distinguishable from those of Araucaria excelsa, though the resemblance of external form alone, especially in the case of foliage shoots, does not amount to proof of generic identity. We have, however, the much more trustworthy evidence of cones and seed-bearing scales in which the characteristic features of living species are clearly shown. Seed-bearing scales almost identical with those of Araucaria excelsa and other recent species have long been known from the Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire. From other parts of England where samples of Jurassic floras are preserved, as at Stonesfield in Oxfordshire, in Northamptonshire and elsewhere, equally striking examples of undoubted Araucarias have been found. Fig. 18 represents part of a large cone described in 1866 by Mr Carruthers from Jurassic rocks at Bruton in Somersetshire: this specimen, now in the British Museum, consists of one side of a spherical cone about 5 inches long and 5 inches broad; in size, as in the form of the seed-scales, it shows a striking likeness to the cones of the Australian species Araucaria Bidwillii, the Bunya Bunya of Queensland. Other equally convincing examples of Jurassic Araucarian cones and seeds may be seen in the museums of York and Northampton. On the north-east coast of Sutherland there is a narrow strip of Jurassic beds forming a low platform between the granitic and Old Red Sandstone hills and the sea. From these rocks Hugh Miller described several fossil plants in his Testimony of the Rocks, and an examination of a large collection obtained from this district by the late Dr Marcus Gunn shows that Miller was justified in speaking of Araucaria as a member of this northern flora. [Illustration: Fig. 18. Araucarites sphaerocarpus Carr. From Jurassic rocks at Bruton, Somersetshire. (British Museum, 2 3 nat. size.)] There is abundant evidence pointing to the existence in Britain during the Jurassic period, and in the early days of the Cretaceous epoch, of Araucarian trees which differed but slightly from the modern species confined to the southern hemisphere. In several localities in France, Germany, and other parts of the continent, Araucarian fossils have been recognised in Jurassic rocks. It is almost certain that some foliage shoots and imperfectly preserved cones described by Dr Nathorst from Upper Jurassic rocks in Spitzbergen were borne by a species of Araucaria. Cone-scales very similar to those from Yorkshire have been discovered in Wealden beds in Cape Colony, and Araucarian wood of Jurassic and Cretaceous age has been found in Madagascar. From Jurassic strata in India and Victoria (Australia), as well as from Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks in Virginia and elsewhere in the eastern United States, well preserved Araucarian fossils are recorded. In a collection of Jurassic plants, obtained a few years ago by the members of a Swedish Antarctic Expedition in Graham's Land, Dr Nathorst has recognised some cone-scales of Araucaria, which demonstrate a former extension of the family beyond the southern limits of South America. It is interesting to find that when we ascend higher in the geological series and pass beyond the Wealden strata to the Middle and Upper sub-divisions of the Cretaceous period, evidence of the wide geographical distribution of the Araucarieae is still abundant. Araucarian wood has been obtained in rocks classed as Upper Cretaceous in Egypt, in East Africa, in Dakota, and elsewhere. In the sedimentary rocks of the Tertiary period undoubted examples of Araucaria are less common, though there can be no doubt that the genus was much more widely spread then than it is at the present day. The well-known Tertiary plant-beds of Bournemouth have afforded specimens of foliage shoots which have been described as a species of Araucaria, though in the absence of well-preserved cones or petrified wood we must admit that the data are inconclusive. It is, however, legitimate to regard the striking similarity of the Bournemouth twigs to those of Araucaria excelsa and A. Cookii as constituting a fairly strong case in favour of the persistence of Araucaria in Western Europe up to the earlier stage of the Tertiary period. Araucarian wood of Tertiary age is recorded from India, while branches with broad leaves like those of Araucaria imbricata have been found in Seymour Island and the Magellan Straits, and specimens of Tertiary wood are described from Patagonia. At the other end of the world. Tertiary rocks on the west coast of Greenland have yielded fragments which may be referred with some hesitation to the genus Araucaria. A few words must be added in regard to the recent discovery by Professor Jeffrey and Dr Hollick of some very interesting Cretaceous specimens in New Jersey of well-preserved cone-scales and foliage shoots of extinct plants closely related to the existing species of Agathis(51). The American fossils are particularly valuable because their preservation admits of microscopical examination of the tissues. In Cretaceous rocks of Staten Island and in other localities on the eastern border of the northern United States, kite-shaped seed-bearing scales almost identical in form with those of recent species of Agathis are fairly common fossils. Similar specimens have long been known from Tertiary rocks in western Greenland. In the case of some of the American examples each scale bore three seeds instead of a single seed in living species: on account of this difference Prof. Jeffrey and Dr Hollick have adopted a distinct generic name, Protodammara. The foregoing sketch is necessarily far from complete, but it may serve as an illustration of the light which is thrown on the past history of recent plants by the investigation of the relics of ancient floras. The family Araucarieae now represented by a small number of species which, with the exception of the Andian and Brazilian Araucarias, are restricted to a small region in the southern hemisphere, was one of the most widely spread sections of the seed-bearing plants during the Mesozoic era. Ancestors of Araucaria must have been common trees in the European vegetation in Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous periods, and even as late as the Tertiary period there is evidence that representatives of the family still lingered in the north. One conclusion which seems almost unavoidable is that the species of Araucaria and Agathis that survive, in some cases only in one or two small islands in the South Pacific, have in the course of successive ages wandered from the other end of the world. Their migrations can be partially traced by the fragments embedded in Jurassic and later sediments, but we can only speculate as to the causes which have contributed to the changes in the fortunes of the family; how much influence may have been exerted by changes in physical conditions in the environment, and to what extent the production of more successful types may have been the dominant cause of the decline, it is impossible to say. One thing at least is certain, that few existing plants are better entitled to veneration as survivals from the past than are the living species of Araucaria. CHAPTER VIII THE MAIDEN HAIR TREE '...the trees That whisper round a temple become soon Dear as the temple's self.' Keats. The Maiden Hair tree of China and Japan, which was introduced into Europe early in the eighteenth century, has now become fairly well known. Though hardy in England, it requires warmer summers for full development and regular flowering. To botanists this Eastern tree is of peculiar interest, partly because of the isolated position it occupies in the plant-kingdom and partly by reason of its great antiquity. There is probably no other existing tree which has so strong a claim to be styled a 'living fossil,' to use a term applied by Darwin to survivals from the past. In 1712 the traveller Kaempfer proposed for this plant the generic name Ginkgo, and Linnaeus adopted this designation, adding the specific name biloba to denote the bisection of the wedge-shaped lamina of the leaf into two divergent segments. In 1777 the English botanist Sir J. E. Smith expressed his disapproval of what he called the uncouth name Ginkgo by substituting for Ginkgo biloba the title Salisburia adiantifolia, but as it is customary to retain names adopted or proposed by Linnaeus, the founder of the binominal system of nomenclature, the correct botanical designation of the maiden hair tree is Ginkgo biloba. Mere personal preference such as that of Sir J. E. Smith for Salisburia is not an adequate reason for rejecting an older name. [Illustration: Fig. 19. Ginkgo biloba Linn. (Slightly reduced.)] In its pyramidal habit Ginkgo agrees generally with the larch and other Conifers. Like the larch and cedar it possesses two kinds of foliage shoots, the more rapidly growing long shoots with scattered leaves and the much shorter dwarf-shoots which elongate slightly each year and bear several leaves crowded round their apex. The leaves (Fig. 19), which are shed each year, are similar in the cuneate form of the lamina and in the fan-like distribution of the forked veins, to the large leaflets of some species of maiden hair ferns: the thin lamina carried by a slender leaf-stalk is usually about 3 inches across, though in exceptional cases it may reach a breadth of 8 inches. The lamina is usually divided by a deep =V=-shaped sinus into two equal halves; it may be entire with an irregularly crenulate margin, or, on seedlings and vigorous long shoots, the lamina may be cut into several wedge-shaped segments. The male and female flowers are borne on separate trees; the male consists of a central axis giving off slender branches, each of which ends in a small terminal knot and two elliptical capsules in which the pollen is produced. The female flowers have a stouter axis which normally produces two seeds at the apex. The seed is encased in a green fleshy substance and, as in the fruit of a cherry or plum, the kernel is protected by a hard woody shell. In the form of the leaves and in the structure of the flowers Ginkgo presents features which clearly distinguish it from the Conifers, the class in which, until recently, it was included.

In all Flowering Plants and in Conifers the male reproductive cells have no independent means of locomotion; they are carried to the female cell by the formation of a slender tube--the pollen-tube--produced by the pollen-grain. In the Ferns, Lycopods and Horsetails--in fact in all members of the Pteridophyta--as also in the Mosses and Liverworts as well as in many of the still lower plants, the male cells swim to the egg by the lashing of cilia like those on the male cells of Ginkgo. This difference in regard to the nature of the male cells was considered to be a fundamental distinction between the higher seed-bearing plants and all other groups of the vegetable kingdom. It was, therefore, with no ordinary interest that Hirase's discovery was received, as it broke down a distinction between the two great divisions of the plant-world which had been generally accepted as fundamental; though it is only fair to say that the German botanist Hofmeister, a man of exceptional originality and power of grasping the essential, foresaw the possibility that this arbitrary barrier would eventually be removed.

Other equally convincing examples of Jurassic Araucarian cones and seeds may be seen in the museums of York and Northampton. On the north-east coast of Sutherland there is a narrow strip of Jurassic beds forming a low platform between the granitic and Old Red Sandstone hills and the sea. From these rocks Hugh Miller described several fossil plants in his Testimony of the Rocks, and an examination of a large collection obtained from this district by the late Dr Marcus Gunn shows that Miller was justified in speaking of Araucaria as a member of this northern flora. [Illustration: Fig. 18. Araucarites sphaerocarpus Carr. From Jurassic rocks at Bruton, Somersetshire. (British Museum, 2 3 nat. size.)] There is abundant evidence pointing to the existence in Britain during the Jurassic period, and in the early days of the Cretaceous epoch, of Araucarian trees which differed but slightly from the modern species confined to the southern hemisphere. In several localities in France, Germany, and other parts of the continent, Araucarian fossils have been recognised in Jurassic rocks. It is almost certain that some foliage shoots and imperfectly preserved cones described by Dr Nathorst from Upper Jurassic rocks in Spitzbergen were borne by a species of Araucaria. Cone-scales very similar to those from Yorkshire have been discovered in Wealden beds in Cape Colony, and Araucarian wood of Jurassic and Cretaceous age has been found in Madagascar. From Jurassic strata in India and Victoria (Australia), as well as from Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks in Virginia and elsewhere in the eastern United States, well preserved Araucarian fossils are recorded. In a collection of Jurassic plants, obtained a few years ago by the members of a Swedish Antarctic Expedition in Graham's Land, Dr Nathorst has recognised some cone-scales of Araucaria, which demonstrate a former extension of the family beyond the southern limits of South America. It is interesting to find that when we ascend higher in the geological series and pass beyond the Wealden strata to the Middle and Upper sub-divisions of the Cretaceous period, evidence of the wide geographical distribution of the Araucarieae is still abundant. Araucarian wood has been obtained in rocks classed as Upper Cretaceous in Egypt, in East Africa, in Dakota, and elsewhere. In the sedimentary rocks of the Tertiary period undoubted examples of Araucaria are less common, though there can be no doubt that the genus was much more widely spread then than it is at the present day. The well-known Tertiary plant-beds of Bournemouth have afforded specimens of foliage shoots which have been described as a species of Araucaria, though in the absence of well-preserved cones or petrified wood we must admit that the data are inconclusive. It is, however, legitimate to regard the striking similarity of the Bournemouth twigs to those of Araucaria excelsa and A. Cookii as constituting a fairly strong case in favour of the persistence of Araucaria in Western Europe up to the earlier stage of the Tertiary period. Araucarian wood of Tertiary age is recorded from India, while branches with broad leaves like those of Araucaria imbricata have been found in Seymour Island and the Magellan Straits, and specimens of Tertiary wood are described from Patagonia. At the other end of the world. Tertiary rocks on the west coast of Greenland have yielded fragments which may be referred with some hesitation to the genus Araucaria. A few words must be added in regard to the recent discovery by Professor Jeffrey and Dr Hollick of some very interesting Cretaceous specimens in New Jersey of well-preserved cone-scales and foliage shoots of extinct plants closely related to the existing species of Agathis(51). The American fossils are particularly valuable because their preservation admits of microscopical examination of the tissues. In Cretaceous rocks of Staten Island and in other localities on the eastern border of the northern United States, kite-shaped seed-bearing scales almost identical in form with those of recent species of Agathis are fairly common fossils. Similar specimens have long been known from Tertiary rocks in western Greenland. In the case of some of the American examples each scale bore three seeds instead of a single seed in living species: on account of this difference Prof. Jeffrey and Dr Hollick have adopted a distinct generic name, Protodammara. The foregoing sketch is necessarily far from complete, but it may serve as an illustration of the light which is thrown on the past history of recent plants by the investigation of the relics of ancient floras. The family Araucarieae now represented by a small number of species which, with the exception of the Andian and Brazilian Araucarias, are restricted to a small region in the southern hemisphere, was one of the most widely spread sections of the seed-bearing plants during the Mesozoic era. Ancestors of Araucaria must have been common trees in the European vegetation in Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous periods, and even as late as the Tertiary period there is evidence that representatives of the family still lingered in the north. One conclusion which seems almost unavoidable is that the species of Araucaria and Agathis that survive, in some cases only in one or two small islands in the South Pacific, have in the course of successive ages wandered from the other end of the world. Their migrations can be partially traced by the fragments embedded in Jurassic and later sediments, but we can only speculate as to the causes which have contributed to the changes in the fortunes of the family; how much influence may have been exerted by changes in physical conditions in the environment, and to what extent the production of more successful types may have been the dominant cause of the decline, it is impossible to say. One thing at least is certain, that few existing plants are better entitled to veneration as survivals from the past than are the living species of Araucaria. CHAPTER VIII THE MAIDEN HAIR TREE '...the trees That whisper round a temple become soon Dear as the temple's self.' Keats. The Maiden Hair tree of China and Japan, which was introduced into Europe early in the eighteenth century, has now become fairly well known. Though hardy in England, it requires warmer summers for full development and regular flowering. To botanists this Eastern tree is of peculiar interest, partly because of the isolated position it occupies in the plant-kingdom and partly by reason of its great antiquity. There is probably no other existing tree which has so strong a claim to be styled a 'living fossil,' to use a term applied by Darwin to survivals from the past. In 1712 the traveller Kaempfer proposed for this plant the generic name Ginkgo, and Linnaeus adopted this designation, adding the specific name biloba to denote the bisection of the wedge-shaped lamina of the leaf into two divergent segments. In 1777 the English botanist Sir J. E. Smith expressed his disapproval of what he called the uncouth name Ginkgo by substituting for Ginkgo biloba the title Salisburia adiantifolia, but as it is customary to retain names adopted or proposed by Linnaeus, the founder of the binominal system of nomenclature, the correct botanical designation of the maiden hair tree is Ginkgo biloba. Mere personal preference such as that of Sir J. E. Smith for Salisburia is not an adequate reason for rejecting an older name. [Illustration: Fig. 19. Ginkgo biloba Linn. (Slightly reduced.)] In its pyramidal habit Ginkgo agrees generally with the larch and other Conifers. Like the larch and cedar it possesses two kinds of foliage shoots, the more rapidly growing long shoots with scattered leaves and the much shorter dwarf-shoots which elongate slightly each year and bear several leaves crowded round their apex. The leaves (Fig. 19), which are shed each year, are similar in the cuneate form of the lamina and in the fan-like distribution of the forked veins, to the large leaflets of some species of maiden hair ferns: the thin lamina carried by a slender leaf-stalk is usually about 3 inches across, though in exceptional cases it may reach a breadth of 8 inches. The lamina is usually divided by a deep =V=-shaped sinus into two equal halves; it may be entire with an irregularly crenulate margin, or, on seedlings and vigorous long shoots, the lamina may be cut into several wedge-shaped segments. The male and female flowers are borne on separate trees; the male consists of a central axis giving off slender branches, each of which ends in a small terminal knot and two elliptical capsules in which the pollen is produced. The female flowers have a stouter axis which normally produces two seeds at the apex. The seed is encased in a green fleshy substance and, as in the fruit of a cherry or plum, the kernel is protected by a hard woody shell. In the form of the leaves and in the structure of the flowers Ginkgo presents features which clearly distinguish it from the Conifers, the class in which, until recently, it was included. In 1896 the Japanese botanist Hirase made the important discovery that the male reproductive cells of Ginkgo are large motile bodies provided with a spirally coiled band of minute cilia--delicate hairs which by their rapid lashing-movement propel the cell through water. In all Flowering Plants and in Conifers the male reproductive cells have no independent means of locomotion; they are carried to the female cell by the formation of a slender tube--the pollen-tube--produced by the pollen-grain. In the Ferns, Lycopods and Horsetails--in fact in all members of the Pteridophyta--as also in the Mosses and Liverworts as well as in many of the still lower plants, the male cells swim to the egg by the lashing of cilia like those on the male cells of Ginkgo. This difference in regard to the nature of the male cells was considered to be a fundamental distinction between the higher seed-bearing plants and all other groups of the vegetable kingdom. It was, therefore, with no ordinary interest that Hirase's discovery was received, as it broke down a distinction between the two great divisions of the plant-world which had been generally accepted as fundamental; though it is only fair to say that the German botanist Hofmeister, a man of exceptional originality and power of grasping the essential, foresaw the possibility that this arbitrary barrier would eventually be removed. The Ferns and other plants in which the male cells are motile, represent earlier stages in the progress of plant development, when the presence of water was essential for the act of fertilisation, a relic of earlier days when the whole plant-body was fitted for a life in water. As higher types were produced, the plant-machinery became less dependent on an aqueous habitat, and the loss of organs of locomotion in the male cells is an instance of the kind of change accompanying the gradual adaptation to life on land. The idea of the gradual emancipation of plants from a watery environment is expressed in a somewhat extreme form by the author of a book entitled The Lessons of Evolution(52), who states that the ocean is the mother of plant-life and that plants formed the army which conquered the land. In Ginkgo we have a type which, though similar in most respects to the Conifers, possesses in its motile reproductive cells a persistent inheritance from the past. The recognition of this special feature afforded a sound reason, especially when other peculiarities are considered, for removing Ginkgo from the Conifers and instituting a new class-name, Ginkgoales. Ginkgo is a generalised type, linked by different characters both with living members of the two classes of naked-seeded plants and with certain existing Palaeozoic genera. It is a survivor of a race which has narrowly escaped extinction; the last of a long line that has outlived its family and offers by its persistence an impressive instance of the past in the present. Though Mrs Bishop in her Untrodden Paths in Japan speaks of forests of Maiden Hair trees apparently in a wild state, it is generally believed that they were cultivated specimens."
